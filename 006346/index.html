The linguistic output of the average normal adult speaker, i.e. E-language  is usually envisioned as unsystematic, unruly  mix of utterances of various types. The present article argues against this conventional understanding and shows that linguistic performance has internal structure composed of 3 subsystems in reflection of the types of  social relations of the individual speaker reflected in one's linguistic behaviour. 
The social interactions of a normal adult human are of 3 major types : a. interactions at the professional level with colleagues and co-workers, b. interactions at the personal level with family members, friends, neighbours etc., c. occasional interactions with strangers, i.e. fellow humans. These 3 types of communicative engagements determine the internal structure of the  linguistic output, or E-language, which is organized into 3 subsystems : a code-like subsystem, an inferential subsystem and a rudimentary subsystem. These exist and function in parallel  in the human mind. From a usage-based perspective the language system is a reflection of the linguistic communication of the normal adult human. This suggests that an adequate description  of the language system as a pre-requisite to the design of linguistic theories,  must recognize  and incorporate all three subsystems.  Each of the three  reveal different aspects of the bio-cognitive foundations of language in the human organism and attributes to a better understanding of the Language Faculty. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006346/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006346<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>competence, performance, i-language, e-language, language system, communication, linguistic theory, language faculty, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>215 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006346">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006346">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
