– the account is privative 
– sonorants do not spread [voice] because they do not have it
– there is no rule ordering (phonological processes are not ordered, phonetic interpretation operates on the final phonological form)
– CP sandhi voicing is part and parcel of all voice assimilation phenomena word-internally
The account is based on two mutually related assumptions: 1. The interaction between phonology and phonetics in a sound system involves building arbitrary relations between the two domains. 2. Laryngeal Realism is replaced by Laryngeal Relativism, which allows almost identical phonetic facts to stem from completely opposite representational systems. CP sandhi voicing cannot be treated solely on phonological or solely on phonetic grounds. Phonetic interpretation requires both aspects to be taken into account, and thus, CP sandhi voicing is both phonological and phonetic in nature – it is systemic.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001601/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001601<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cyran, E., H.
