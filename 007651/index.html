Since the postulated reciprocal meaning inside the meaning of a word like 'different' requires the presence of a semantic antecedent, the theory entails that the apparent internal reading of a sentence like 'John saw and reviewed different films', which does not contain a plural DP that could serve as the semantic antecedent of the postulated reciprocal meaning, must be licensed in a way that is entirely different from the way in which the internal reading of a sentence like 'Anna and Bill like different films' is licensed. In the present paper, I adduce additional pieces of evidence for this theory. In order to enhance the plausibility of the proposed theory, I also show how the collective interpretation of reciprocals and the interaction of reciprocals and cumulative interpretation can be accounted for within the theory.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007651/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007651<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, pp. 143-163, https://doi.org/10.21248/hpsg.2023.8</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>hpsg, minimal recursion semantics, reciprocals, cumulative readings, right-node raising, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>131 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007651">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007651">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
