The paper argues that the syntactic explanation fairs better than the presuppositional approach. However, the argument is not that Chierchia (1998) is wrong, but rather that the major insights of his theory should be recast in terms of a feature logic, feature interpretation and subcategorization. In essence, this paper is a defence of Chierchia 1998 with a slight modification which only partially separates the distributional characteristics of quantifiers from the semantic nature of nouns. This defence is particularly relevant given that even Chierchia himself (2010) rejects the underlying semantics that is essential to Chierchia 1998’s explanation. Furthermore, it is argued that in order for subcategorization to adequately account for the facts, lexical items need to be stored with syntactic features and cannot be featureless roots.
