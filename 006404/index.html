In the last 2 million years (my) the earth  has experienced radical fluctuations of climatic patterns which triggered  radical changes in ecology. Many species have adapted to these extreme conditions by evolving  higher intelligence. This general tendency is  manifested most clearly  in the  evolution of the homo branch of primates  and homo sapience by the evolution of larger brains resulting in  elevated learning  capacity and creative problem solving and innovation, identified by some scholars as the most distinctive characteristic of our species. In this context the article argues that language can be defined as  a repository of knowledge and  a tool for preservation,  accumulation, dissemination  and creative reuse of knowledge and previous experience in  stimulating future innovation. 
The origin of language is understood as behavioural innovation which, given its adaptive utility,  triggered  interaction of biological and cultural evolution resulting in a human language faculty  as innate predispositions for effective learning  the basic aspects of language, both meaning and structure , most essential for its primary function of knowledge preservation and dissemination. On the other hand,  the grammatical and semantic idiosyncrasies demonstrated in language diversity are  explained by  cultural evolution of languages in service of social and cultural identity of the communities.   <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006404/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006404<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>climate change, human speciation, evolution of language, language faculty, innovation, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>412 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006404">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006404">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
