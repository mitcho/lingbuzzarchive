We argue, based on an investigation of epistemic modals and adverbs in Greek and Italian, that one class of PPIs shows their limited distribution due to their particular presuppositions. We offer a semantic account of epistemic modal adverbs that captures their distribution in patterns typically known as modal concord (see Huitink 2012, 2014), but which we will call 'modal spread'. Modal spread is not usually discussed in the context of positive polarity, but we argue that it is instrumental in revealing an additional argument of modality, namely a function that reflects the speaker's perspective. We show that the perspective is always positive, which is crucial to understanding the novel observation that negative modal adverbs do not exist. We show that by analyzing modal verbs as having a presupposition of positive bias which survives negation, we can capture the fact that both the modal and the adverb scope above negation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003151/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003151<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>epistemic modality, must, epistemic adverbs, bias, modal concord, alternatives, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>281 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003151">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003151">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
