We explore the hypothetico-deductive method and hypothesize that there are elements from the Aktionsarten domain that determine the verbal behavior in relation with a causative meaning. Consequently, we present a theoretical review of aspectual classes, employing the tools of a recent approach to the architecture of grammar named Nanosyntax (STARKE, 2009). Thereby, it will be possible to understand the finer-grained constraints that the classes of ‘states’ and ‘accomplishments’, for instance, impose for the causativization, taking into account ‘nano’ syntactic and semantic features, such as Initiation, Process, Result and Boundness. We conclude, therefore, that for a predicate to be interpreted
as a causative one, the event denoted by it needs to be dynamic in its nature. In addition, we show that the functional sequence (F-seq), in the way it is proposed within the nanosyntactic model, allows us to explain the possible association of more than one syntactic node with the same verbal argument, as well as its underassociation and consequent identification with a null causative nucleus, as it happens to be the case in Brazilian Portuguese causativization.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005035/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005035<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1981-57942019000200421</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>causativization. event composition. aktionsarten. nanosyntax. functional hierarchy of the verbal domain., semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>134 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005035">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005035">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
