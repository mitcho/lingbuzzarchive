On the one hand it is envisioned as  an evolutionary process of variation and selection resulting in the formation of a Language Faculty, by some, and as cultural evolution in the formation of languages by others. The competing alternative view evokes the Chaos theory and the concept of self-organization in either biological context, explaining the formation of a Language Faculty by self-organization of neurons, or in language systems as the formation of sociolects and idiolects. 
The present article argues that both evolutionary principles and self-organization interact at every step in an entangled interdependence in the formation and functioning of language and languages, which makes the individual participation of each difficult to pinpoint and estimate, suggesting that the evolution of language is better understood by treating the two formalisms as two interacting partners, not as alternatives.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006613/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006613<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>self-organization, language faculty, co-evolution, complexity, idiolect, sociolect, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>435 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006613">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006613">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
