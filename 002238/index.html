This paper attempts to remedy the situation by presenting a case study of Italian nominal inflection that directly bears on this question. The Stan- dard Italian nominal system morphologically marks two distinct genders, three distinct nominal classes (idiosyncratic nominal endings), and two numbers, a combination which lends itself to a theoretical investigation of number-gender in- teractions. Crucially, Italian nominal inflection also distinguishes between gram- matical, i.e., idiosyncratic, and natural, i.e., context-dependent, gender. This paper provides evidence that even though the source of valuation of these two genders is distinct, their grammatical locus is the same. More precisely, they enter the same gender Agree chain. The main theoretical contribution of the paper comes from configurations in which there are two possible sources of valuation of the same gender Agree chain. This in turn allows us to investigate the timing of related syntactic operations and their interactions in a controlled way.
I use the intricate patterns to argue that we need to distinguish between val- uation by Agree, i.e., a narrow-syntax process that utilizes Feature Inheritance (Richards, 2007; Chomsky, 2008, and subsequent work) and Agree, and variable binding, i.e, a process that gets triggered by labeling modeled as minimal search (Chomsky, 2013). While in most cases the output of these two processes is iden- tical, I present data from the domain of socio-linguistic variation where we can observe a reflex of the distinction in the overt morphology.
More precisely, the data provide evidence that unvalued φ-features within DP are always introduced by D. If φ-features appear on lower functional heads, it is only via Feature Inheritance. Their value, however, may be assigned either by an assignment function introduced by D, triggered by labeling at the Transfer to the interpretive component, or it may be encoded in the lexical entry of a nominal root (cf. Kramer 2009).1
The option of having features valued from two different places, combined with Feature Inheritance, yields non-trivial timing interactions, including interactions that are best modeled in terms of φ-feature Agree intervention. The crucial obser- vation is that only properly individuating D introduces a complete set of gender and number features. Consequently, gender assignment is dependent on the di- visional function in the sense of Borer (2005), and not on the counter function, related to the Number feature.
The second major contribution of the paper is that it provides evidence that there is no gender and number dependency as such (cf. Greenberg 1963; Noyer 1992; Harley and Ritter 2002, among others). Instead, the paper argues that the seeming gender-number dependency is a side effect of gender valuation being de- pendent on the (non-)deficiency of the divisional head. The empirical motivation for the proposal comes from the domain of mass nouns and nominals denoting predicative or non-atomic relations; namely, from the observation that Ds refer- ring to non-atomic entities give rise to defective gender and number chains in a way parallel to defective T in the CP domain.
Aside from providing a theoretical motivation for distinguishing between val- uation by Agree and variable binding, and a theoretical explanation for the cross- linguistically common dependency between number and gender, the paper makes one additional theoretical contribution. Namely, that only a subset of nouns are based on category-neutral roots (cf. Marantz 1997), a conclusion supported by data from derivational morphology and compounding.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002238/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002238<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agree valuation, italian, number, gender, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2230 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002238">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002238">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
