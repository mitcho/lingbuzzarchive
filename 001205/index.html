 The matrix subject is 3rd person, masculine, and singular; the matrix verb denotes a speech-report and agrees in phi-features with the matrix subject. The embedded clausal complement contains a subject which has traditionally been described as a SE-anaphor (marked 3rd singular) which is obligatorily coreferent with the matrix subject. But the embedded verb which should agree with its clausemate subject (taan) shows up, not as 3rd-person masculine (or even with default agreement which, in Tamil, would be 3rd-person neuter) but with 1st-person singular agreement marking. Crucially and tellingly, such mismatched verbal agreement only shows up with matrix speech-event denoting verbs like "say"; with all other verbs that take clausal complements, we get the expected 3rd person masculine agreement on the embedded verb. The focus of the paper is to investigate why this kind of agreement mismatch obtains. I argue that the 1st person singular agreement is actually due to indexical shift -- a phenomenon wherein an indexical (like "I") refers, not to the speaker/author of the utterance context, but to the speaker/author of the context denoted by the speech-event (in the example above, the speech-event is the event of saying and its author is the individual denoted by the matrix subjec, Raman). I term the 1sg agreement on the embedded verb "monstrous agreement", in line with the Kaplanian tradition of referring to (context-)shifted indexicals as "monsters".<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001205/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001205<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of NELS 41</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>monsters, agreement, de se, indexicals, anaphora, features, tamil, morphology, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001205/v2.pdf">v2 [March 2011]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001205/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2010]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>622 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001205">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001205">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
