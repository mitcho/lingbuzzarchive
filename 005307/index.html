To achieve this, I use Hopper and Thompson’s (1980) Transitivity parameters and other linguistic features such as the case of the clitic in the causative construction and the person features of the causative verb to characterize different aspects of the elements involved in causative constructions. The analysis is conducted on a dataset with over 4500 sentences taken from Corpus del Español (Davies 2002), which was analysed by means of two Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression models and a random forest for variable importance. The analysis reveals very clear and distinct semantic profiles of each causative and suggests that the elements comprising Transitivity, understood as a global property of the clause, are very good predictors of which causative predicate is most likely to be used in a given context. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005307/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005307<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>spanish, causatives, bayesian mixed effects, transitivity, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005307/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>302 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005307">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005307">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
