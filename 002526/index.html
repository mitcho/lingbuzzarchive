The Albanian article has the crucial distribution, namely before adjectives and genitives. Our Aromanian data also refer to varieties spoken in South Albanian areas, including the towns of DivjakÃ« and Fier. Preadjectival linkers are demonstratives that agree with the head noun in gender, number, and case. Aromanian has a different series of oblique introducers, which agree with the following (genitive/dative) noun (the possessor) rather than with the possessum (the head noun in a genitive construction). On the basis of morphological evidence, but also of syntactic and interpretive evidence, we argue that linkers (at least in the languages considered) are closest to what is usually called agreement. The key theoretical question is why agreement structures would surface in the form of definiteness morphology, namely articles in Albanian and demonstratives in Aromanian. Our claim is that so-called agreement morphology is an inflectional-level saturation of argument places. The Agree rule therefore matches pairs of interpretable elements concurring to the saturation of the same argument slot.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002526/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002526<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Rivista di Grammatica Generativa</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>aromanian, albanian, syntactic theory, morphology, agreement, case, morphology, syntax, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1012 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002526">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002526">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
