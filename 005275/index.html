These questions are far from trivial, especially if one believes in Universal Grammar (UG). If there is just one underlying DP structure that all languages share, then the rich diversity that the world’s languages exhibit in the way they linearize noun (N) dependents is nothing but puzzling. At the same time, the existence of such diversity raises the question of how varied DP-internal constituent orders can be and what governs their possible variations and/or their delimited variations—questions that have figured prominently since Greenberg’s (1963) seminal work in linguistic typology (see, e.g., Cinque 2010 and the references therein). This paper aims to address all these questions from the perspective of Korean, a language that is well known to have relatively “fluid” DP-internal constituent orders. I show that it is indeed possible to posit a single universal DP structure and derive variant surface orders from it if we resort to so-called roll-up movements and have various syntactic structures manufactured by a derivational mechanism filtered by Optimality Theoretic constraints.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005275/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005275<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>(2020) Japanese/Korean Linguistics 26, 101-115</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>determiner phrase, adjective ordering, split-dp, optimality theory, article-less language, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>303 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005275">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005275">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
