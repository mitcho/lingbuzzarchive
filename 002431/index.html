Evidence from adult grammaticality judgment and comprehension studies</a></b></font><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002431">Ben Ambridge</a><br/>March 2015</center>&nbsp;<p></p>In order to explain the phenomenon that certain English verbs resist passivization (e.g., *£5 was cost by the book), Pinker (1989) proposed a semantic constraint on the passive in the adult grammar: The greater the extent to which a verb denotes an action where a patient is affected or acted upon, the greater the extent to which it is compatible with the passive. However, a number of comprehension and production priming studies have cast doubt upon this claim, finding no difference between highly affecting agent-patient/theme-experiencer passives (e.g., Wendy was kicked/frightened by Bob) and non-actional experiencer-theme passives (e.g., Wendy was heard by Bob). The present study provides evidence that a semantic constraint is psychologically real, and is readily observed when more fine-grained independent and dependent measures are used (i.e., participant ratings of verb semantics, graded grammaticality judgments and reaction time in a forced-choice picture-matching comprehension task). We conclude that a semantic constraint on the passive must be incorporated into accounts of the adult grammar.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002431/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002431<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cognitive Science (resubmitted)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>passives; semantics; syntax; experiencer-theme; theme-experiencer; agent-patient verb, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2764 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002431">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002431">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
