Zulu ngani why, a word used only to question negative clauses, is argued to need a similar analysis, even though it appears in postverbal position. Arguments for the analysis are made on the basis of the distribution of conjoint and disjoint verb forms, interactions between WHY and negation in English, and previous analyses of Zulu's elocutionary force particles yini and na (Thwala 2004). Specifically, ngani is argued to be an Int head, around which the IP must move. It is suggested that reason WHY (as opposed to purpose WHY) is universally introduced above negation. Implications are discussed for analysing IAV (Immediate After the Verb) position focus effects in Bantu languages as a dedicated sub-IP focus position, showing that ngani weakens the attractiveness of such analyses.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000920/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000920<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Lingua, 121, pp. 805-821.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>reason questions, in situ wh questions, complexity filter, why, negation, conjoint, disjoint, junctivity, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>124 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000920">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000920">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
