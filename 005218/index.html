This approach does not account for the absence of reconstruction effects in the construction and the lack of isomorphism between both duplicate predicates; moreover, island effects cannot be taken to support a multiple spell-out account, as doubling patterns for which a movement analysis is untenable also display them. We advance that predicate doubling is better understood as involving a base generated predicate in the left periphery of the clause that functions as a contrastive topic, i.e., it evokes a set of alternative questions (Büring 2003). We show that a number of properties of the construction follow from this analysis, including sensitivity to islands. Furthermore, the proposal provides a rationale for instances of genus-species splits attested in the construction, and also offers a straightforward account for otherwise mysterious asymmetries arising with factive verbs.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005218/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005218<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Draft</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>spanish, predicate doubling, contrastive topic, question under discussion, islands, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>268 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005218">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005218">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
