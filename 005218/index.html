This approach is mainly motivated by the fact that two instances of the same lexical verb appear in the construction, and by the observation that the pattern is sensitive to island restrictions. In contrast, we contend in this paper that predicate doubling is a phenomenon for which an analysis based on multiple copy spell-out cannot be empirically substantiated. We argue that the construction is better understood as involving a base-generated predicate in the left periphery that functions as a contrastive topic. We show that a number of properties of predicate doubling follow from this analysis, including lexical identity between  the verbs and sensitivity to islands. Furthermore, our proposal provides a rationale for genus-species splits in the construction, and also offers a straightforward account for otherwise mysterious asymmetries arising with factive verbs.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005218/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005218<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Natural Language & Linguistic Theory</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>spanish, predicate doubling, contrastive topic, question under discussion, islands, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005218/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>836 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005218">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005218">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
