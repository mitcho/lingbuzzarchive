This predicts that 'you' should be easier to process than 'I' or 'he', especially for children. But not all occurrences of 'you' can be correctly interpreted via self-ascription. We consider two cases where 'you' does not indicate self-ascription: interpretation as an eavesdropper and 'you' in direct speech. In our experiment, we compare children’s interpretation of the pronouns 'I', 'you' and 'he', in both direct and indirect reported speech, and in both addressee and eavesdropping situations. We tested 71 five-year-olds, 63 nine-year-olds, and 52 adults in a referent-selection task and found a clear de se effect for children when directly addressed: they performed better with 'you' than with 'I'/'he' in indirect speech, but worse with 'you' than with 'I'/'he' in direct speech. We explain the latter finding in terms of the attraction of the de se interpretation strategy, which leads addressees to automatically self-ascribe 'you' even in a direct speech report.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003064/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003064<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Glossa, <a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/gjgl.187">http://doi.org/10.5334/gjgl.187</a></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>de se, second person, aquisition, pronoun interpretation, direct/indirect speech reports, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003064/v2.pdf">v2 [September 2016]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003064/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>756 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003064">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003064">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
