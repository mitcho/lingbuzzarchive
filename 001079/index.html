Since the bound variable interpretation requires that person features be non-indexical, this lead us to examine more carefully the contexts in which 1st and 2nd person are indexical, and the contexts in which they are not. We show that local domain forms are a reliable diagnostic for non-indexicality: if a 1st or 2nd person form can be a local domain form, then it can support bound variable anaphora. We show how this applies in English, French, Russian, and Hindi. We further propose that pronoun denotations are structurally determined: while 1st and 2nd person indexical pronouns are D-forms, non-indexical pronouns are Ï-forms.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001079/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001079<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>bound variable, indexicality, pronouns, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>417 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001079">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001079">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
