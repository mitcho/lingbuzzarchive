I provide several arguments showing that clause union properties are licensed in the absence of complex head formation and that complex head formation hence cannot be seen as a condition on clause union/restructuring. Complex head approaches are compared to syntactic complementation approaches, in particular an approach where the verbs of a restructuring construction project independent VPs which include all the arguments associated with the particular verbs. A series of empirical facts are considered (constituency, word order, modification, and event structure properties) which all point to the conclusion that these constructions involve regular VPs rather than complex V-V heads. While it is not excluded that complex head approaches could be adjusted to accommodate theses facts, the main advantage of the VP-complementation approach is that the sum the properties discussed follows without additional assumptions from the structure suggested and that this approach also correctly predicts which constructions are excluded.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000147/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000147<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Syntax</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>complex predicates, extraposition, event structure, restructuring, verb clusters, vp-structure, infinitival nominalizations, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000147/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2005]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1816 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000147">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000147">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
