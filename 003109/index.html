When producing two-verb clusters in Dutch, a speaker can choose between two word orders. Previous corpus studies have shown that a wide range of factors are associated with this word order variation. We conducted a large-scale corpus study in order to discover what these factors have in common. The underlying generalization appears to be processing complexity: a variety of factors that are related to verbal cluster word order, can also be related to the processing complexity of the cluster's context. This implies that one of the word orders might be easier to process --- when processing load is high, speakers will go for the easier option. Therefore, we also discuss which of the two word orders is easier to process. By testing for associations with factors indicating a higher or lower processing complexity of the verb and its context, we find evidence for the hypothesis that the more frequent of the two orders is easier to process.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003109/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003109<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Language Sciences: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.langsci.2016.10.009</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>verb cluster, processing complexity, word order, language variation, dutch, corpus linguistics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003109/v2.pdf">v2 [October 2016]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003109/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>808 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003109">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003109">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
