We argue that “language”, not only as a formal entity but also as a biologically (and thus, physically) based system, is nothing more and nothing less than the intersection of three systems, each of which has independent existence and takes part in independent cognitive / computational processes. The systems we will consider are the well-known syntax, semantics and phonology, which we will analyze in a novel manner: rather than brought together by an undefined “rewiring” of the brain (see Hauser, Chomsky & Fitch, 2002; Chomsky, 2005, among others), we will follow and hopefully advance recent research (e.g., Uriagereka, 2012) claiming that “language” is better defined as the resolution between a fundamental tension that arises in the intersection between these systems.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002090/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002090<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms. Comments welcome.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>innateness; syntax; semantics; phonology; language design; faculty of language; dynamical frustration, semantics, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002090/v2.pdf">v2 [June 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002090/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3032 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002090">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002090">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
