It is a descriptive, comparative and contrastive analysis of movement transformations within the Minimalist Program (MP), initiated and developed by Chomsky (1993, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2001) and others. It is supplemented by the Contrastive Framework, initiated by Fries (1945) and further developed by Lado (1957). In order to do this, data was collected from selected Nigerian and Cameroonian films, and also from some Nigerian and Cameroonian novels. The analysis of the data revealed that the two Non-Native Englishes (NNEs) under study share many similarities but few differences. As far as similarities are concerned, it was observed that CamE and NigE make use of the “Subject and Auxiliary Deletion Rule”, together with the “Wh-in situ Strategy” for wh- questions. Besides, Sala’s (2003, 2014) “Super-ordinate Clause Deletion” was applicable to both CamE and NigE for echo-questions. Moreover, the avoidance of Chomsky’s Last Resort Principle on Do-support and T-to-C movement was licensed in the two NNEs for yes/no questions. All these processes were said to result from two phenomena, namely, the influence of other languages (local languages and French) and the simplification process, otherwise known as the process of Leveling out by Bloomfield (1984:500) and Jesperson (1948:316) as quoted in Sala (2003:230). Besides, covert movement (LF movement), it was observed, applies both in NigE and CamE for wh-questions, given the in situ nature of the wh-element. Furthermore, traces were considered quasi inexistent in the two NNEs because the tendency is to avoid overt movement in favour of covert movement, where the wh-element moves covertly to check the [+wh] features carried by the Complementizer position. As far as the differences are concerned, it was observed that unlike in CamE where Sala’s Unbounded “they” is used as a last resort for passivisation, NigE uses what has been called the Anaphoric/Cataphoric Pronoun Insertion as a last resort. These findings made it possible to make some assumptions on a possible West African English (WAE) that could enjoy widespread intelligibility in the sub-region. In this vein, it was  assumed that the features CamE share with NigE are likely to be features of a more inclusive WAE, given many factors amongst which the position of Nigeria as the most populated and developed country in the region. Finally, the findings made it possible to stress the need for an International or Global variety of English that could enjoy worldwide intelligibility. It was then shown that only further comparisons of NNEs could help attain such an objective.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002810/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002810<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>The University of Yaounde I</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>new englishes, west african englishes, came, nige, wh-in-situ, lf movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>725 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002810">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002810">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
