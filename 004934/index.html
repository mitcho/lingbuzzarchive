We argue that Subject Island effects are caused by the fact that subject-embedded gaps are pragmatically unusual – as the informational focus does not usually correspond to a dependent of the subject phrase – and therefore are highly contrary to comprehenders’ expectations about
the distribution of filler-gap dependencies (Hofmeister et al., 2013; Chaves, 2013). This not only explains why sentences with subject-embedded gaps often become more acceptable ‘parasitically’, in the presence of a second gap outside the island, but also explains why some Subject Island violations fail to exhibit any amelioration with repetition (Sprouse, 2009; Goodall,
2011; Crawford, 2011), some ameliorate marginally (Snyder, 2000, 2017) or moderately (Hiramatsu, 2000; Clausen, 2011; Chaves and Dery, 2014), and others become fully acceptable, as in our case. This conclusion extends to self-paced reading Subject Island studies (Stowe, 1986; Pickering et al., 1994; Kurtzman and Crawford, 1991; Phillips, 2006), which sometimes find evidence of gap-filling, sometimes do not.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004934/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004934<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Linguistics, 55(3), 475–521</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>islands, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>196 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004934">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004934">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
