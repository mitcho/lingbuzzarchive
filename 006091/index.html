In contrast to Kiparsky (1997), we argue that all denominals are derived from nominal roots regardless of their alleged (in)ability to combine with PP-objects different from the root ("hammer with a shoe" versus "*tape with pushpins"). On the basis of an experiment eliciting English similarity judgments, we show that nominal roots are not just defined by one predominant semantic aspect (as in Dowd 2010), but by a variety of aspects (shape, function, material, a.o.), along the lines of the Qualia Structure theory of concepts proposed by Pustejovsky (1995). Shape, function and material all have a large effect on denominal sentence acceptability, and we conclude that acceptability is best accounted for by all of these aspects and possibly others.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006091/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006091<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the 39th West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>denominal verbs; roots; experimental morphology; true denominals; pseudo denominals; concepts; similarity, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>232 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006091">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006091">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
