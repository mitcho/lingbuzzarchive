This paper explores the labeling hypothesis of Chomsky 2013, 2015 in relation to DP-internal syntax. Possessors and external arguments (EA) of nouns give rise to [XP, YP] configurations, which are problematical for labeling under Chomsky's assumptions. But in languages with grammatical gender, N/n differ from their clausal counterparts V/v in having intrinsic phi-features. 

My paper claims that gender-number concord between n and a possessor or EA labels nP via shared features, enabling these arguments to surface nP-internally. Bantu languages (among others) show this feature-sharing clearly in the form of overt concord on the morpheme 'of' that introduces a lexical argument. 

In contrast, possessors in a number of genderless languages, including Turkish and Yup’ik, must raise to permit labeling of nP, and surface in a high functional category whose head can agree with them in the DP-internal counterpart to subject agreement (Abney 1987). 

The paper contributes to an ongoing debate regarding the mechanics of concord and its place in the grammar: is it a consequence of Agree in the syntax, or a distinct, perhaps post-syntactic process? Assuming that it feeds the labeling algorithm and bleeds DP-internal possessor raising and possessor agreement, gender-number concord must be syntactic. I argue for some simple modifications to Agree that enable a unified approach to agreement and concord.

My proposals are based on data from Bantu, Afro-asiatic, and Romance languages on the one hand and Turkish, Hungarian, Yup’ik, Chamorro, and Tsutujil on the other. I also discuss Maasai, West Flemish, and Matsigenka, showing how to interpret the less transparent facts of their genitive constructions in relation to the labeling hypothesis.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003637/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003637<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>concord, labeling, agreement, possessors, np, dp, bantu, turkish, west flemish, linkers, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003637/v2.pdf">v2 [September 2017]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003637/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2017]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>357 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003637">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003637">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
