We argue that adjunct extraposition is itself derivationally ambiguous, and may be derived either by movement of the adjunct or by base-generation of the adjunct in extraposed position. Accordingly, we argue for a relaxation of the strictly compositional view that nominal modification is always mediated by syntactic sisterhood. We argue that while base-generated extraposition is possible with quantificational host DPs, adjunct extraposition from definites must be derived by movement. This accounts for a number of asymmetries between extraposition from definites and from other types of DP, concerning reconstruction for Condition C, scope reconstruction, and information-structural restrictions on extraposition.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002794/current.pdf?_s=P9RhX2nMqWOeXstO">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002794<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002794">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002794</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Syntax</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>extraposition, binding, scope, focus, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>68 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002794?_s=a2bTa52DFfpZ3X62&amp;_k=Ul6YMss7gaS2i4B3&amp;3">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002794?_s=a2bTa52DFfpZ3X62&amp;_k=Ul6YMss7gaS2i4B3&amp;4">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
