welcomed colleagues from 21 different countries to a collaborative
exploration of the challenging and inspiring journey of learners and
educators in the field of language education.

The conference provided an opportunity for all stakeholders to share
their views on language education. Colleagues met with world-renowned
experts and authors in the fields of education and psychology, faculty and
administrators from various universities and institutions, teachers from
secondary educational backgrounds and higher education, as well as
learners whose voices are often not directly shared but usually reported.

The conference name, Eclipsing Expectations, was inspired by two
natural phenomena, a solar eclipse directly before the conference, and
a lunar eclipse, immediately after. Learners and educators were hereby
invited to join a journey to observe, learn and exchange ideas in<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001428/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001428<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>foreign language education, semantics, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>437 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001428">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001428">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
