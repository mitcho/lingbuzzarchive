In this paper, novel data from Hungarian will be offered to present a clause type radically pared down to the minimal VP, making it possible to observe the VP by itself. The syntax of such radically truncated clauses (RTCs) will show that the Hungarian VP is, in fact, head-final. I will also claim that RTCs in Hungarian provide prima facie evidence against the universality of head-complement branching order (Kayne 1994), and strong support to the availability of OV as a basic, non-derived word order (Haider 2000). I will also show that RTC data lend further support to the adjunction analysis of both topicalization (Lasnik and Saito 1992) and quantification (Fox 1995, Reinhart 1995, Chomsky 1995). Finally, I will discuss how RTC data corroborate the split-DP proposal of Sportiche (1998). The discussion will be supported with evidence from corpus data and from grammaticality judgement tests.

VERSION2: I added more discussion on the missing (or silent) DP layer in objects and on the possible positions for objects (in situ or topic). I also  report new grammaticality judgement data from a survey.

VERSION3: I added statistical analysis of the survey data and some discussion of the relevance of RTCs with regard to spell-out and phasehood.

VERSION4: More discussion of VO-OV and the internal structure of VP.

VERSION5: The final, published version. The discussion of the corpus data and the acceptability survey results can be found as electronic supplementary material, available on the website of the journal.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004495/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004495<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Syntax 24:3, September 2021, 376–416</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>headedness, word order, minimal vp, hungarian, syntax, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004495/v5.pdf">v5 [May 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004495/v4.pdf">v4 [July 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004495/v3.pdf">v3 [July 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004495/v2.pdf">v2 [April 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004495/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1656 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004495">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004495">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
