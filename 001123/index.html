human language system as a whole. These patterns, which, if conceived as a logical space generated

by a 2-by-2 factorial design, often appear to fall into a skewed, asymmetrical configuration; frequently, a clear-cut 3-out-of-4 pattern can be established but, if not, a general imbalance is usually

still predominant. {\em Inter alia}, examples of such configurations are Holmberg's Generalisation, FOFC, the Square of Opposition ({\em id est} the nonlexicalisation of the O corner), Romance Interrogatives, Greenberg's Universal 25, Monotonicity and constraints on negation, Subject-Pro-Drop, N-drop, clause syntax and illocutionary force mismatching etc.\\



The central question to pose is whether such 3/4-patterns underlyingly are significant for the Faculty of Language or whether they simply are epiphenomena without further meaning or implications. In this article I argue that linguistic structures are sets of sets of purely privative atomic features which display surface phenomena such as asymmetries or skewings as a consequence of underlying feature interaction; I call this the Atomic Feature Conjecture. I suggest that features are combined by means of Merge and I demonstrate that there are three types of feature relationships: independence, dependence and antagonism. As far as asymmetry is concerned, I define two types of asymmetrical patterns: Type B, simultaneous incompatibility; and Type M, feature dependence. I furthermore outline consequences of these findings for Linguistic Theory, emphasising, on the one hand, the importance of privative features, and, on the other hand, the notion of the empty set as a fundamental component of the computational system. Ultimately, I also address remaining theoretical dilemmas stemming from the proposal and discuss future directions that cross-disciplinary research within the field could take.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001123/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001123<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>MPhil-thesis; University of Cambridge</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>linguistic theory, biolinguistics, language patterns, cognition, language faculty, features, morphology, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>501 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001123">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001123">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
