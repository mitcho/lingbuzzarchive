There are a number of factors that inhibit rendaku. A well-known factor is a voiced obstruent: Rendaku does not apply if the second member of compounds contains a voiced obstruent (i.e. Lyman’s Law, or OCP (-son, voice)). This paper focuses on another factor to block rendaku. Although /h/ usually becomes labial [b] when rendaku applies (e.g., hako ‘box’ + hune ‘ship’ → hakobune ‘ark’), the rendaku application of /h/ is blocked if the following consonant is labial [m] (e.g., suna ‘sand’ + hama ‘beach’ → sunahama ‘sand beach’/*sunabama). One hypothesis about this rendaku blocking is that, if /h/ became labial [b], it would beget a sequence of homorganic consonants [b...m], which would violate a putative OCP-labial effect. The current paper is the first report of an experiment that examined whether this restriction applies productively to nonce words that contain labial consonants. The results show that 1) the OCP- labial effect can be generalized in rendaku; 2) it works locally rather than non-locally; and 3) the applicability of rendaku is gradient: The more similar two consonants are, the more strongly they are disfavored. To account for this gradient effect, I argue that the process involves two OCP-labial constraints: OCP (labial) and OCP (labial, -continuant).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003290/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003290<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>japanese; rendaku; ocp-labial effect; phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003290/v2.pdf">v2 [May 2017]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003290/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2017]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>830 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003290">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003290">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
