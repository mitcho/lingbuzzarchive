Though these halves in general match up, the values can be distinct or one can be missing altogether. Throughout the dissertation, I investigate various phenomena where the values of the two halves of the feature do not line up, looking at the mass/count distinction, collective nouns in (British) English, and quantified noun phrases in Russian, among others.

I look at agreement that targets the iF value of a feature instead of the uF, which leads to semantically motivated agreement, and I show that this has a different, more restricted behavior than morphologically motivated agreement, operating under different structural configurations. From this difference, I provide a version of Agree that can handle the differences between semantic agreement and morphological agreement. I also discuss the Agreement Hierarchy of Corbett (1979, et seq), where it appears to hold within a single sentence. I show that when two targets agree with a hybrid controller, the targets can mismatch with one agreeing with the iF and one with the uF. Not all mismatches are allowed, a fact that is explained through the timing of agreement.

Furthermore, I show how this view of features allows us to look at the mass/count distinction in a new light. I propose that two classes of atypical mass nouns - fake mass nouns in English and plural mass nouns in Telugu - result from there being a mismatch on the number features of the items, which results in the morphology of the noun having either mass or count behavior (depending on the language), whilst the semantics shows the opposite behavior.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002763/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002763<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD thesis, University of Connecticut</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>features, agree, agreement, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>958 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002763">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002763">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
