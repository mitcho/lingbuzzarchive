Such markers are supposed not to be restricted to the syntax of the host utterance. In this paper, we bring novel evidence that challenges this view as well as the need for the so-called Thetical Grammar that makes available an independent domain for discourse processing. We, rather, argue that thetical markers can be accounted for using Sentence Grammar that includes no further level of grammatical representation. Our main evidence comes from the marker ʕaad in Jordanian Arabic which is shown to be a thetical marker whose function is to provide supplementary information that also describes the speaker’s attitude. We propose that the variant position of ʕaad in its host sentence is a direct result of the movement (or base-generation) of some parts of the utterance to the Specifier position of the projection headed by ʕaad. In so doing, this paper adds credence to proposals where thetical markers are incorporated within sentence grammar (Potts 2005; de Vries 2012; Wiltschko & Heim 2016).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005236/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005236<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under Review </td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>arabic; cooptation; sentence grammar, thetical markers;  thetical marker ʕad, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005236/v2.pdf">v2 [June 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005236/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>635 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005236">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005236">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
