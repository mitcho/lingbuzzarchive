This is because they are supposed not to be restricted to the syntax of the host utterance. In this paper, we bring evidence that challenges this view, arguing that thetical markers can be accommodated within sentence grammar. Firstly, we establish the evidence that ʕad in Jordanian Arabic is a thetical marker whose primary function is to provide a comment or supplementary information that also describes the speaker’s attitude. Secondly, we show that the variant position of ʕad on the surface is a direct result of the movement (or base-generation) of part of the utterance to the Specifier position of the projection headed by ʕad. Additionally, the so-called cooptation (a process that redefines lexical words as theticals) is shown to lack solid evidence to take over instead of grammaticalization which is normally affiliated with sentence grammar. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005236/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005236<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under Review </td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>arabic; cooptation; sentence grammar, thetical markers;  thetical marker ʕad, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005236/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>113 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005236">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005236">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
