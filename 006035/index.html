A first asymmetry is determined by (systematic) vs. constrained productivity of monadic variants linked to the causative alternation; a major one emerges when other, better-known forms of intransitive alternation (Property of Agent Alternation) are brought into the equation. Their distribution provides us with distinct well-defined verb sets following a consistent behavior. A solid account requires us to determine the semantic (lexical) factors and necessary properties behind the grammatical patterns noted, the specific verbs allowed in each case and their potential correlation to verb types classes commonly embraced in the literature. We seek a balance between the role of lexical-semantic semantic properties play in the restrictions noted, and the requisites imposed by the construction. The paper fundamentally considers the correlation of these patterns with the Manner/Result Complementarity, the degree to which the verbs allowed or rejected in each (or both) intransitive alternations coincide with the complementary distribution often defended in the literature (Levin & Rappaport 2008, 2015), and pays special attention to the verbs unexpectedly allowed in each case according to the usually-assigned type. We contend that the intransitive constructions analyzed here offer new and original evidence on the need to reclassify some verbs and/or the need of a finer-grained Manner/Result complementarity.
