Reflexive/reciprocal polysemy induced by verb affixes (or clitics) is common, but reflexive/reciprocal polysemy with full direct object (DO) anaphors appears to be relatively uncommon outside of Africa. Many other languages of Africa (e.g. Babanki, Bafut, Fe’efe’e, Ga, Ibibio, Limbum, Saari, Urhobo and Yoruba) have transitive reciprocal polysemy of this kind, but if so, the source of reciprocal interpretation remains a puzzle. We propose a novel type of reciprocal construction that can account for this pattern. In such Transitive Reciprocal Constructions (TRC), we posit that the direct object is a variable with no contribution to reciprocal meaning, but that it may have reciprocal form by virtue of shape concord with a reciprocal marker (RCM) on little v (also Bruening 2006). Otherwise it spells out as an anaphor that does not impose a specific kind of anaphoric reading. The source of reciprocal meaning is actually the RCM which can be covert in some languages. We further show that our proposal has far-reaching implications for theories of reciprocity and how identity-dependent meaning can be composed in natural language.
