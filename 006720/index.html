The analysis is built on novel data taken from a Spanish corpus and from an online acceptability judgement task, focusing on long (i.e., matrix) passive, short (i.e., embedded) passive and on the occurrence of modal verbs. These data lead us to postulate that, albeit their surface similarities, these three constructions have different syntactic structures. In particular, the different acceptance rates of long passives show that the three constructions have a different transparency status.

Building on phase theory and previous accounts on long passives in English and Romance, we argue that two factors determine the grammaticality of long passives: the phasal vs. non-phasal status of the complement and the structural integration of the embedded clause. The discussion shows that gerunds are secondary predicates, while Pseudo-relatives and infinitives are complements of the perception verb. More precisely, Pseudo-relatives are defective CPs (and thus weak phases) that allow raising-to-object, but not raising-to-subject. Infinitives, on the other hand, show inter-speaker variation with respect to their structural size (voiceP vs TP), accounting for variable acceptability judgments.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006720/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006720<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pseudo-relatives, infinitives, gerunds, spanish, syntax, perception verbs, phase theory, movement, deficiency, variation, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006720/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>447 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006720">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006720">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
