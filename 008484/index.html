Although segmental and suprasegmental phonology may interact, such interactions are mediated by prosodic units: vowel reduction may apply in unstressed syllables, or voiceless stops may become aspirated in the onsets of stressed syllables. In this dissertation I show that the lexical stress system of the Northwest Caucasian language Abkhaz challenges these assumptions about prosody. I argue that all segments in Abkhaz, whether low vowels or voiceless stops, can carry lexical accents underlyingly. Both stress and the prosodically-conditioned segmental phonology of the language are computed over these segmental accents without any mediation by prosodic units like syllables or moras. In this sense, Abkhaz displays a segmental stress system. I argue that it must be parameterized on a language-specific basis whether a stress system operates over syllables, moras or segments, and that once such parameterization is allowed, Abkhaz word stress can be successfully analyzed with familiar theoretical tools.
	I develop a grid-based analysis of Abkhaz word stress following Idsardi (1992), including the assignment of primary and secondary stress as well as a stress-conditioned segmental process of schwa epenthesis. I use new data to argue that schwa is not a phoneme in Abkhaz at all, and that it is always predictably epenthesized. This analysis predicts not only the main patterns of stress assignment, but also many classes of morpho(phono)logical exceptions and even exceptions to those exceptions. All of this is accomplished within a single rule-based grammar without lexically specific phonology and where the morphosyntax is never directly visible to the phonology.
	The phonological data come mainly from an Abkhaz dictionary (Yanagisawa 2010), which I compile into two new corpora of stress alternations. The corpora contain 990 noun, adjective and verb stems in several inflected forms, for a total of 4,205 words. I have conducted the first phonetic study of Abkhaz word stress, and report preliminary data on the acoustics of primary and secondary stress from four speakers. I rely on poetic evidence from scansion and native speaker intuitions to study Abkhaz syllabification.
	Methodologically a recurring theme of the dissertation is the use of computer-guided analyses. I use programming tools to uncover exceptionless phonotactic restrictions on Abkhaz vowels, and the corpora were both built and analyzed in a semi-automated fashion. This allows for automatic empirical evaluations of the coverage of different theories of stress assignment at a scale which would be impossible to achieve by hand. When combined with traditional theoretical argumentation, this allows me to develop a theory of Abkhaz prosody which correctly predicts stress on 98.89% of the inflected noun and adjective forms I study, and on 95.70% of the inflected verb forms. The combination of several different methodologies and sources of data places the empirical generalizations and the theoretical conclusions in this dissertation on a more solid foundation.
	I hope that this dissertation contributes empirically to the documentation of a complex stress system, methodologically to the use of computer-aided phonological analysis, and theoretically to our understanding of prosodic phonology.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008484/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008484<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD dissertation, Yale University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>abkhaz, caucasian, phonology, prosody, phonetics, word stress, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>285 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008484">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008484">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
