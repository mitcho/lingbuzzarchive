The first represents the asymmetry between mothers and daughters that is called dominance, i.e. syntactic hierarchy. The second is the selectional asymmetry between sisters, which is translated into precedence in the phonological component. The third, called behindance, is an alternative for dominance, and represents parataxis. Parenthesis and coordination are analysed on the basis of behindance. In our derivational model of grammar it is defined as a special type of inclusion that blocks c command. The linearization of these structures is performed by a standard algorithm that exploits the asymmetrical nature of Merge. It is predicted that parenthetic material can neither move toward the matrix, nor be bound by a constituent from the matrix; this leads to an asymmetry between first and second conjuncts.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000038/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000038<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of IPSI-2004, Pescara.
