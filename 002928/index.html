The term “ergativity” has been most commonly used to refer to systems with one or both of the following properties: (i) transitive subjects pattern differently from intransitive subjects and from transitive objects; and (ii) transitive objects and intransitive subjects pattern alike. A wide range of work across different traditions converges on the idea that “ergativity” is not a single unitary phenomenon, and is not realized in the same way across different languages. Dixon (1994, 219), for example suggests that “there is no necessary connection between ergative characteristics and any other linguistic feature”, and Johns (2000, 67) writes in a similar vein that there may be “little value in studying ergativity as a thing in itself.” In her recent survey of ergativity, Deal (2015b) suggests that “ergativity is not one but many phenomena.” Nonetheless, certain patterns and correlations emerge, suggesting that while there is certainly diversity, there is also some unity––perhaps motivating the existence of this additional volume on the topic. The general themes of unity and diversity in and among ergative systems are touched on in the chapters that follow.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002928/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002928<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Oxford University Press (to appear)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ergativity, alignment, case, agreement, syntax, morphology, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1464 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002928">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002928">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
