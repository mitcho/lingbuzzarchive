Thefirst is anterior-time semantics; both 'John left' and 'John has left'locate an event of John's leaving in the past with the respect to thetime of their utterance. The second observation is morphological; thelexical verbs in the two sentences above are inflected identically. Ofcourse, the challenge in pursuing this analysis lies in thenon-totality of these similarities.  While the Past and PresentPerfect are, truth-conditionally identical in some contexts, they aredistinct in others.  Additionally, for certain verbs, like 'eat', themorphology is not identical either.

This paper focuses on the morphosyntactic challenges that this accountfaces.  We argue that the present perfect consists of a Past Tensescoped over by a Present Tense; likewise the Past Perfect ('John hadleft') of two Past Tenses stacked, and perfects under modalauxiliaries ('John must have left') or in infinitival contexts aresimply instances of a Past Tense as well. After briefly outlining asemantics which can account for divergences like the one mentionedabove, we elaborate on the following morphosyntactic proposal: Pasttense requires that the verb after it bear an inflectional feature,which is spelled out as '-en', as in 'eaten'.  However, a verb whichcarries both this feature and a finiteness feature spells out as'true' past morphology, as in 'ate'; but these two forms are syncreticfor some verbs.  Finally, the presence of multiple functional heads inthe TAM domain (e.g., two tenses) can trigger feature conflict andtherefore dummy-verb insertion.  Since the finiteness feature whichtriggers true past morphology only appears on the highest verb in afinite clause, dummy-verb-insertion prevents this feature fromreaching the lexical verb.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002591/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002591<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Proceedings of NELS 45</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>past tense, perfect, auxiliaries, verbal inflection, aspect, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1515 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002591">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002591">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
