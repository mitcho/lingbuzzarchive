not been able to benefit from enrollment as children in the public school system. The following report
from the field calls attention to the special circumstances of this heterogeneous group of literacy
learners. The workshop described here engages learners who are literacy learners as well as second
language learners of the national language, in this case Spanish. Literacy learning proceeds in parallel
with second language learning. The report summarizes a series of informal interviews with students and
their teacher and observation of their adult literacy program, during a period of approximately ten
years. As such it provides preliminary findings for better understanding the problems of community
literacy programs in bilingual communities in general. The tasks of learning to read and write present
themselves in a special situation of language contact, that of community language and national
language.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007794/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007794<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Adult Learning, Knowledge and Innovation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language awareness, bilingualism, second language learning, gender parity index, spanish, nahuatl, phonology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>222 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007794">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007794">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
