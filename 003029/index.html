This paper presents the results of a perception study showing that the lateral is generally more perceptible than the rhotic in coda position in Modern French. The hypothesis that perception played a role in the phonological asymmetry in Haitian is compatible with these results. The paper sketches an analysis of how the perceptual asymmetry between French coda laterals and rhotics resulted in the emergence of a new phonological grammar, distinct from both the grammar of the substrate and superstrate languages. This analysis is in line with previous works on the role of perception in second language acquisition, loanword adaptation, creolization, and sound change more generally.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003029/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003029<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>appeared in the Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages (https://doi.org/10.1075/jpcl.00020.sto)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonology, phonetics, perception, haitian, french, creole, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003029/v2.pdf">v2 [August 2017]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003029/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1075 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003029">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003029">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
