This paper provides the first empirical test of the hypothesis according to which this asymmetry is perceptually grounded, with the French coda rhotic being less perceptible and therefore harder to learn than the French coda lateral. The results are broadly compatible with the perceptual hypothesis: (i) the coda lateral was to found to be more perceptible on average than the coda rhotic for French hearers in four different segmental contexts and (ii) the coda lateral was found to be never less perceptible than the coda rhotic in any of those contexts. The results also suggest that the deletion vs. maintenance of a sound in a given context cannot be explained only in terms of whether this sound is above or under a certain perceptual threshold in this context, but that either a notion of average perceptibility or phonological regularization across contexts is necessary in addition.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003029/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003029<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonology, phonetics, perception, haitian, french, creole, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>191 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003029">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003029">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
