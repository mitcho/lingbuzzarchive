Production data, however, show that this ordering is rigid: only SOV sequences are attested in Italian, an observation reminiscent of Superiority. The first goal of the paper is to replicate this observation in comprehension; the second is to derive the Subject-over-Object pattern in terms of Intervention, with the additional assumption that only nested chains count as interveners. Three experiments are reported here. Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 show that SOVs interpretations are systematically favored over OSV alternatives. In addition, a differential feature specification of Number and, to a lesser extent, of Topicality helps to avoid intervention. Experiment 3 addresses a potential confound related to the presence of the clitic pronoun in Clitic Left Dislocations (ClLD).  <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007680/current.docx">docx</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007680<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Child Language</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>information structure, intervention, filler-gap dependencies, topic, focus, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>140 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007680">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007680">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
