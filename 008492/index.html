Evidence from resumption and prolepsis in Igbo</a></b></font><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/008492">Mary Amaechi</a>, <a href="/lingbuzz/008492">Doreen Georgi</a><br/>October 2024</center>&nbsp;<p></p>There are two major types of approaches to the subject / non-subject extraction asymmetry known as the that-trace effect: (a) structural accounts that prohibit subject extraction in the syntax; (b) surface-oriented PF accounts that rule out the surface string that results from long subject extraction. Pesetsky (2017) points out that it is still unclear what kind of phenomenon the that-trace effect is. In this paper, we argue that the effect has a syntactic cause in Igbo (Benue-Congo, Nigeria). The argument is based on a repair strategy for long subject A'-dependencies in Igbo  that involves resumption. We show that even though Igbo in prinicple allows long A'-movement in the syntax and and also trace spell-out (= the ingredients for a widely pursued surface/PF-account of the that-trace effect), the resumption repair does not emerge from long subject movement, but rather involves prolepsis. We further argue - based on novel evidence involving subextraction from subjects in Igbo - that the syntactic restriction underlying the that-trace effect in Igbo is (Spec-to-Spec) antilocality. 

More generally, this paper studies the formation of long A'-dependencies in Igbo (including the description of extraction asymmetries), and shows that one (not surface-evident) option is prolepsis.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008492/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008492<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Lanuages Special Issue "Escaping African `islands' " (editor: J.
