Kayne 1994; Massam 2001 and many others). However, many such analyses face an overgeneration
problem: some material thought to be VP-internal never appears fronted and must apparently
always be stranded (Chung 2005; Massam 2010). This paper first provides novel evidence for
VP-fronting in an SVO language, the understudied Polynesian outlier Imere (Vanuatu), motivated
by the placement of adverbial particles. But this analysis too suffers from the stranding problem:
VP-fronting cannot drag along any DPs, PPs, and CPs. At the same time, Imere has a familiar SVO
VP, with no evidence of vacating movements or an unorthodox base-generated structure. To solve
this issue, I propose that VP-fronting is accompanied by distributed deletion (Fanselow and Ćavar
2001), driven by a constraint that favors realizing only the verb. I extend this analysis to eight other
VP-fronting languages, from five different language families. In all these languages, what remains
in the fronted VP is a structurally reduced dependent, like an adverbial particle or a determinerless
object. Building on Clemens (2014, 2019), I adopt a constraint that requires dependents of a head
that spell out in the same phase to remain adjacent, thus surviving distributed deletion.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006475/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006475<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Linguistic Inquiry</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, predicate fronting, word order</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>377 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006475">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006475">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
