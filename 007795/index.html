The existence of phenomena which are both syntactic and dissimilatory (e.g. case, cf. Preminger, 2014; Levin, 2015; Yuan, To Appear) and, I argue, certain cases of local anaphora (Lidz, 2001; Reuland, 2011) thus poses a challenge. To accommodate these facts, I develop a revised model of Agree (renamed RELATE), the core intuition underlying which is the observation of a “Category Process Correlation (CPC)”, namely that syntactic dissimilation overwhelmingly obtains between two non-distinct categories while syntactic assimilation obtains between two distinct ones. I show that, under RELATE, we can not only derive cases of syntactic assimilation (e.g. φ-agreement) and dissimilation (e.g. case and local anaphora) under a single operation, but can also correctly predict why cases of syntactic dissimilation are exceptional and pertain primarily to nominals. The latter follows directly from the way in which the CPC interacts with the distribution of individual categories across phases. I conclude by showing that the current model also makes a number of empirical predictions which seem, by and large, to be fulfilled.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007795/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007795<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>(newer version contains important typo fixes and updated discussion on some points)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dependent case, phi agreement, local anaphora, features, phases, categories, grammatical modularity, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007795/v2.pdf">v2 [January 2024]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/007795/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2024]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>364 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007795">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007795">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
