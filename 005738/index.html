In this paper, we examine the consequences of such a view for verbs of inherently directed motion like arrive, enter, ascend, descend, depart, leave, etc. (Levin, 1993; Rappaport Hovav, 2014). We show that this class of verbs does not show uniform behavior with respect to sub-lexical modiﬁcation with modiﬁers like again and durative temporal modiﬁers, which are well-established diagnostics for decompositional theories of verb meaning (e.g., Dowty, 1979; von Stechow, 1996; Beck and Johnson, 2004). This suggests that a syntactic, decompositional view may be appropriate only for some of these verbs, while others must contain all directed motion entailments within their verb roots. We argue that a root-sensitive approach to lexical decomposition of this verb class is necessary in order to account for their distinct grammatical properties.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005738/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005738<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of Sinn und Bedeutung 25</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>lexical semantics, verbs of inherently directed motion, roots, event structure, sub-lexical modiﬁcation, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005738/v2.pdf">v2 [February 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005738/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>630 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005738">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005738">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
