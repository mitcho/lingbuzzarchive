The construction is found in several other languages east of the Baltic Sea but not in Scandinavia or, as far as we know, generally West Europe. In this paper, the main syntactic properties of the construction will be described. A related construction is found in Icelandic, where ‘we Anna’ means ‘Anna and I’. This construction has recently been subject to a detailed examination in Sigurðsson & Wood (2020). The Finnish and Fenno-Swedish construction will be compared with the Icelandic one. The fact that ‘we…with Anna’ unlike Icelandic ‘we Anna’ can be discontinuous means that it has more complex syntax. A generalization is proposed characterising the syntactic conditions on ‘we…with Anna’ in Finnish and Fenno-Swedish. A syntactic analysis will be proposed, in part following Sigurðsson & Wood (2020) on the Icelandic counterpart.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005201/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005201<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>K.R.
