In this paper, I argue that these asymmetries in preposition stranding (P-stranding) reflect a basic and fundamental divide among different varieties of A'-extractions. In some but not all instances of A'-movement, the moving element is not fully constructed until after movement takes place. As a consequence, when the base position for this type of extraction is the complement of certain types of prepositions, it lacks material that the preposition requires. I show that the proposal is easily integrated into the theory of 'wholesale late merger' (Takahashi 2006, Takahashi & Hulsey 2009), and in turn, provides support for it. Extending wholesale late merger to account for subtle structural differences among A'-extractions allows us to understand why, even though P-stranding is common to all A'-extractions, extractions can differ according to the restrictions that they place on it.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002019/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002019<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Revised paper (with new title) available at http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002131 – please read that one!!!</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>preposition stranding, wholesale late merger, a-bar movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>782 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002019">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002019">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
