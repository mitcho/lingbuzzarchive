In this paper, I argue that several instances of first conjunct complementiser agreement should be analysed as resulting from clausal coordination and Right Node Raising. I show that this approach accounts for the following observations. In Frisian, the complementiser can show first conjunct agreement, but the verb cannot. Also in Frisian, first conjunct complementiser agreement triggers a two-event reading of the sentence. In Polish, last conjunct agreement on the verb is possible only in the context of first conjunct agreement on the complementiser. These observations cannot be accounted for under approaches that assume only nominal coordination, or resolution of agreement at PF. I also discuss coordinator agreement in Tegelen Dutch, and show that it provides further support for the existence of clausal coordination as an underlying structure of a superficial coordination of nouns. The analysis means that first conjunct agreement can be the result of different underlying syntactic structures, that should be distinguished empirically and theoretically.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007619/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007619<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Glossa: a journal of general linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>complementiser agreement, first conjunct agreement, right node raising, frisian, polish, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>370 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007619">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007619">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
