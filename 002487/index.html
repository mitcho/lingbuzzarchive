This trend is reflected in approaches oriented around thematic roles, such as those that adopt some version of UTAH, as well as event-structure oriented approaches like that in Ramchand 2008 in which, in a sense, event structure is underlying syntactic structure. An alternative approach attributes the relative uniformity of the expression of argument structure to the principles that interpret syntactic structure semantically; here, syntax is truly autonomous, with the atoms of syntactic representations and their relations carrying no semantic values. On this alternative approach, we might expect that the same meanings could be expressed by different syntactic structures and that the same syntactic structures might express different meanings.  

	In this chapter, we present an account of the heads that add participants to events.  Within current theories, these heads are usually identified as voice, appl, and prepositions, as well as little v for some linguists, where the causative little v head might introduce an agent or causer. We will follow Pylkkänen (2008), Harley (2013) and Legate (2014) among others, in arguing that little v does not, by itself, introduce an argument, so our account will focus primarily on the voice, appl, and prepositional heads. We will argue that syntactic heads crucially involved in the interpretation of argument structure – heads like v, voice, p and appl – are subject to contextual allosemy at the semantic interface such that each such head may have a particular range of meanings, including a null (expletive) meaning, depending on the syntactic context. Once syntactic heads are absolved from the necessity of carrying certain features relevant to their interpretation explicitly, when the features are rather computed contextually at the point of semantic interpretation, we can develop a sparse inventory of functional heads for the syntax. The empirical focus of the chapter revolves around Icelandic figure reflexives, Japanese adversity causatives, and possessor raising constructions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002487/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002487<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In Roberta D’Alessandro, Irene Franco and Ángel J.
