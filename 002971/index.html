We will argue that double agreement is not to be interpreted as resulting from two syntactic Agree operations: Positing two such operations involving the possessive pronoun leads to insurmountable technical problems; rather, we will introduce novel empirical evidence showing that the agreement between Possessor and possessive pronoun is anaphoric rather than grammatical in nature. While this solves the
double agreement problem, the dative case on the possessor still needs to be accounted for. We will propose that dative case does not come from the possessive pronoun or from a preposition as in the Predicate Inversion approach, but rather from N. This not only avoids an overgeneration problem resulting in case assignment to the wrong goal, but also opens up the possibility to unify case assignment in Germanic with possessor agreement in languages like Turkish.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002971/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002971<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Lingua 121, 2069-2088</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>possessor doubling, external possessor, agreement, case, dative, semantic agreement, anaphoric agreement, syntax, german, alemannic</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>235 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002971">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002971">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
