However, the presence of multilingualism in the community or society would have a larger effect on the communities' code which is associated with the community. According to a scholar Khubchandani, "The inter-group communications among tribal record a wide range of variation in the claims of bilingualism, mostly depending upon the degree of heterogeneity in their contact environments and their attitude to languages surrounding them" (2001:26). According to him the community which is surviving in the heterogeneous society has less possibility to be monolingual. In India, every Tribe is surrounded by other major languages and even tribes are dependent to a great extent on them for economic, social, and cultural reasons. So language contact has likely been common throughout their lifecycle. This language diversified situation is making them multilingual and multi-scriptural. It is a very thriving research area. The study has been conducted through available literature and direct observation in a north Indian tribe whereby the research findings have concluded three situations: first, if the tribes frequently use other codes, certainly tribes lose their identity, and second, the tribes shall lose the knowledge of ethno medicine which is transmitted by their forefathers and the third one is the loss of their culture and literature and everything that tribes possess which is unique.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007605/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007605<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Language in India, USA </td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>linguistic landscaping, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>235 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007605">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007605">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
