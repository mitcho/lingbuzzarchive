Many of the analyses of verbal syntax and semantics that are now accepted essentially without comment are essentially modernized versions of the previously-discredited proposals of the Generative Semanticists. Progress is not retrograde, however: many of the most cogent empirical objections to the decompositional project have been answered, and there are at least some inklings of the explanations for others. The net result is that modern theories can capture many of the morphological, syntactic and semantic generalizations that motivated the original proposals in the first place, which were difficult to capture in the Lexicalist frameworks that dominated the field from the 1970s to the 1990s. The proposals also have serious scientific legs, in that they have made predictions and captured cross-linguistic generalizations that would have been impossible to contemplate without them. In this paper, I first take some time to
systematically address the status of some of the original empirical objections to the decompositional project, given a particular set of assumptions about how decomposition works in a modern framework. I then quickly survey some decompositional proposals with an eye to conveying the breadth and depth that the approach has developed. I focus primarily on English data, since that has been at the center of the debate for philosophers of language, but I will touch on some of the key points from unrelated languages which have particular relevance to the claims, from a linguists' point of view.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001532/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001532<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In Handbook of Compositionality, edited by Wolfram Hinzen, Markus Werning and Edouard Machery, p. 328-350.
