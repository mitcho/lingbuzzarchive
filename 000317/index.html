While classical type theory has since long been overshadowed by set theory as a foundation of mathematics, recent decades have shown remarkable comebacks in the fields of mechanized reasoning and linguistics. Since the late 1960's philosophers and logicians, for various reasons which we will dwell upon, have started to combine higher order logic with modal operators. This combination results in higher order modal logic, the subject of this chapter. 



The chapter contains a theory of hyperintensionality in higher order modal logic.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000317/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000317<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>P.
