The languages of the Pacifc Northwest provide a fertile ground for testing and development of such theories. I examine patterns from Lushootseed (Salish) and Nitinaht (Wakashan), as well as typologically and geographically distant languages like Thao and Manam

(Austronesian) and develop a theory where reduplicated forms are the result of linearization of non-linear phonological forms (Raimy 2000). I argue that non-linearity can appear in lexical representations as well as in poly-morphemic forms and that linearization applies at several points in a derivation, rather

than solely at the interface with phonetics. The latter point challenges Urbanczyk's (2001) monostratal Optimality Theoretic analysis of Lushootseed and suggests that several strata of linearity and non-linearity intervene between lexical and surface phonological forms.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000661/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000661<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Studies in Salishan (MITPELFL 7)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>reduplication, non-linear phonology, optimality theory, stratal ot, lushootseed, nitinaht, thao, manam, salish, phonology, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>787 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000661">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000661">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
