The so-called grammatical theory argues that these inferences obtain from the application of a covert operator exh, which not only has the capability to negate alternative sentences, but also the capability to be embedded *within* sentences under other linguistic operators, i.e. exh has the potential to add to the meaning of expressions (not necessarily full sentences), the negation of their alternatives.
This view typically seeks support from the existence of readings that could not be explained without the extra-capability of exh to occur in embedded positions. However, if some embedded positions seem to be accessible to exh, not all conceivable positions that exh could occupy yield sensible results. In short: the exh approach is powerful, maybe too powerful.

Various approaches based on logical strength and monotonicity have been proposed to justify on principled grounds the limited distribution of exh; these approaches are mostly based on a comparison between possible parses, and considerations of monotonicity (e.g., the Strongest Meaning Hypothesis).
We propose a new constraint based instead on “connectedness”, ruling out parses because of inherent problems their outcome may raise.
Connectedness is a sister notion of monotonicity, which has been recruited to explain certain lexical restrictions on nouns,
adjectives and more recently quantifiers; we propose here that connectedness could play a similar role at the level of propositional meanings.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004247/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004247<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in “Linguistics and Philosophy”.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>exhaustification, monotonicity, connectedness, implicatures, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004247/v2.pdf">v2 [May 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004247/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1060 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004247">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004247">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
