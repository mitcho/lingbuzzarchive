The first part focuses on differential object agreement in Hungarian, where the finite verb always agrees with its subject and sometimes also agrees with the direct object. I argue that both the syntactic structure and the semantic properties of the object are crucial in determining differential agreement. In addition, the morphological realisation of agreement depends on the features of the subject and the object. In inverse configurations, the verb only spells out subject agreement in Hungarian. 

The second part puts the discussion of Hungarian object agreement in a cross-linguistic context. I argue that the phenomenon of “global case splits” represents a dependent-marking counterpart to inverse agreement. In global case splits, case-marking of the subject or the object of a sentence depends on properties of the both arguments, not just the argument that is case-marked (or not). Rather than spelling out an inverse marker (or nothing, as in Hungarian) in inverse configurations, the verb assigns a special case-marker to the one of its arguments in global case splits. Such global case splits represent instances of agreement feeding or bleeding case-marking rather than the other way round. I suggest that Case assignment and probing for phi-features are distinct processes, the order of which varies across languages. If Case assignment precedes phi-agreement, global case splits are ruled out; the order makes them possible.

Finally, I sketch aspects of a parameter hierarchy for agreement systems.
