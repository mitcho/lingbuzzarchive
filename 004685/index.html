This paper presents novel data from the Anlo dialect of Ewe to show that logophoric pronouns have the properties of PRO in the subject position of nonfinite clauses, rather than the properties of logophoric pronouns. Given the overt nature of PRO in this dialect, this paper sheds light on control phenomena such as partial and split control that are invisible in other languages. This paper presents four main arguments against Hornstein (1999)'s control as A-movement: partial control exists, contra Boeckx et al. (2010); split control cannot be derived via A-movement, contra Fujii (2006); Ewe may have control but not raising, which is unexpected if they are similar processes; and finally, that the phonetic form of PRO in Ewe is the same as the logophoric pronoun's is coincidental under the movement theory of control. Chierchia (1990)'s approach to control in which PRO is bound by an operator in the left periphery of the embedded clause provides a straightforward account of the facts seen in Ewe.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004685/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004685<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>control, movement, pro, logophoric, partial, split, pronoun, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>170 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004685">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004685">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
