In Arabic, the verb agrees with the subject in number whenever the word order is SV, but not if the word order is VS. I argue against previous approaches that suggest that this lack of number agreement is due to the absence of syntactic Agree in these configurations. I propose a new account that is based on the assumption that the lack of number agreement in VS orders is the result of head movement of the verb to the T head. I suggest that head movement has two effects: First, head movement of the verb can satisfy the EPP property and, second, the head movement operation that I propose leads to the deletion of the number feature in Modern Standard Arabic. I show that this approach overcomes the problems of previous approaches and I discuss some implications that the theory has for EPP movement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007434/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007434<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Glossa: a journal of general linguistics 8(1)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agreement, word order, head movement, arabic, epp, optionality, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>313 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007434">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007434">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
