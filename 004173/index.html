A single verb however cannot encode both a result state and a manner of action (i.e.  Manner/Result Comple-mentarity). In this respect, Beavers and Koontz-Garboden (2012) discuss a series of verbs of killing which they claim to be counterexamples to this complementarity. Nonetheless, Rappaport Hovav (2017) argues that most of these verbs (i.e.crucify, guillotine and electrocute) are not relevant since they are not monomorphemic or morphologically simple and Manner/Result Complementarity is actually a restriction on root meaning,  not verb meaning.   In this paper,  I focus on monomorphemic verbs of killing and argue that murder and slay, in contrast to the verbs of killing discussed by Beavers and Koontz-Garboden, are more convincing counterexamples the complementarity between manner and result.  More specifically, I argue that murder and slay have both manner and result entailments, and therefore pose a problem to Manner/Result Complementarity since, despite being monomorphemic, encode both a manner of action and a result state.  Thus, the analysis of murder and slay as manner-result encoding verbs suggests that encoding an intentional action, i.e.  agent entailments, appears to be sufficient for a verb to encode a manner of action, as I argue that these agent entailments are responsible for inducing the manner properties in murder and slay.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004173/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004173<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>lexical semantics, verb meaning, manner, result, verbs of killing, agent entailments, intentionality.</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>108 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004173">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004173">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
