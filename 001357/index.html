Some languages have postrelatives (English, Hungarian, Papago), some have prerelatives (Japanese, Turkish, Navajo) and some have both (Quechua, Turkish, Papago). With respect to non-restrictives, , Portuguese lacks non-restrictives that modify an S; Navajo lacks non-restrictives entirely. Andrews argues that Japanese and Turkish make no syntactic distinction between restrictives and non-restrictives . In this paper I will argue that non-restrictive prerelatives in Turkish are in fact free adjuncts when they occur with stage-level predicates. In sectin 1, I will present general fact about Relative Clauses in Turkish; in section 2, the structure of prerelatives and the distinction between restrictive and nonrestrictive prerelatives will be discussed; in section 3, evidence from Stump tests will be presented to argue that NR prerelatives are in fact adjuncts in Turkish; section 4 addresses the question whether they are Free Adjuncts or Absolutes; section 5 addresses the question where they are adjoined; section 6 gives a brief introduction to postrelative nonrestrictives; section 7 presents extra evidence by contrasting the properties of non-restrictive prerelatives in general and the behaviour of NR-prerelatives in Turkish.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001357/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001357<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>2003 , Harvard Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (pp. 199-215).
