Quantitative data taken from a corpus covering French from the mid-12th to the mid-19th century show that enclisis is found until the first half of the 14th century. From a formal standpoint, I provide evidence in favour of the hypothesis that this word order connects to V-movement of the infinitive to the IP-domain. I argue that this operation is driven by the richness of tense inflection, specifically the expression of the /r/ morpheme which is completely lost during the 14th century. The empirical picture further contributes to the debate on the locus of cliticisation, for which I propose a refined distinction between phonological and syntactic cliticisation. The last part of the paper presents evidence for a pronominal tripartition in Middle French, which shows a failed change. The article concludes on how morphophonology is a window to the acquisition of syntactic operations.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007544/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007544<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Journal of Historical Syntax</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>clitics, infinitives, clitic placement, verb placement, language change, syntax, old french</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007544/v3.pdf">v3 [October 2023]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/007544/v2.pdf">v2 [August 2023]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/007544/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2023]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>436 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007544">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007544">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
