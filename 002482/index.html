For this purpose, we will investigate newly formed adjective-noun compounds, e.g., 'Hochlampe' ('high_lamp'), 'Rotdach' ('red_roof'), and their potential to function as lexical labels as well as their capacity to represent names for kinds. The affinity of compounds to be lexicalized and their tendency to undergo semantic specialization will be traced back to the markedness of novel compound expressions, which will lead to a pragmatic analysis along the lines of Levinson’s M-principle. A parallel design for word-formation and syntax as two distinct domains of grammar will be implemented, in which recursive structure building capacities are shared, but with specific configurational restrictions holding in each domain as well as distinct functional profiles.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002482/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002482<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Unpublished working paper, Ms. Universität Kassel (An updated version of the analysis has been presented in Härtl 2016 (= lingbuzz/002670))</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>word-formation, morphology, compound, syntax, kind, label, name, novelty, pragmatics, m-principle</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002482/v2.pdf">v2 [May 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002482/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2048 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002482">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002482">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
