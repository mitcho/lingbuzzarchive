imposed on movement dependencies that pays close attention to a possible lower
bound on legitimate distance.1 In essence, it is encapsulated by the Anti-Locality
Hypothesis stated in (1), which will be picked up in the next section from a quasihistorical
vantage point, put in perspective throughout this chapter, and embellished
with a presentation of more recent theoretical and empirical work pertaining to it.

(1) Anti-Locality Hypothesis (Grohmann 2003b: 26)
     Movement must not be too local.

This take on (anti-)locality did not emerge from a vacuum, however. On the one
hand, a dissertation written just a little later (Abels 2003) dealt with ‘too-close’
relations in syntax under the same name, but for a somewhat different purpose and
within quite a different set of theoretical assumptions. In addition, there are several
obvious precursors in work from the mid 1990s that was never, as far as I am aware
of, pursued any further (Murasugi & Saito 1995; Bošković 1994, 1997; Ishii 1997,
1999; and Saito & Murasugi 1999, all cited by Abels).

In this chapter, I will first localize the idea of ‘anti-locality’ with respect to both
the current understanding of the notion and its roots in generative theorizing. This will
eventually lead to an exposition of the Anti-Locality Hypothesis (1) in the context of a
structural tripartition through Prolific Domains and, subsequently, to the notion of
Copy Spell-Out as a ‘repair strategy’ to void an anti-locality violation that would arise
otherwise. This will finally be related to the conceptual underpinnings of Prolific
Domains, and a specific explanation of the Anti-Locality Hypothesis, stemming from
interface conditions on the derivation and the computational system at large.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003010/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003010<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In Cedric Boeckx (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Minimalism (pp. 260–290).
