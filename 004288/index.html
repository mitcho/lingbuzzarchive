The current title is "Know whether and -ever free relative clauses".] Know whether sentences and -ever free relative clauses have not been studied together, but they have similar contextual constraints. This work offers an explanation of their similarities based on well-established pragmatic principles. These constructions are proposed to evoke equally informative alternatives with stronger presuppositions, and as a consequence of Heimâ€™s (1991) pragmatic principle of Maximize Presupposition, the use of a know whether sentence or a sentence containing an -ever free relative clause requires the presuppositions of all of its alternatives not to be satisfied. This gives rise to a variety of requirements, depending on what grammatical environment either construction appears in and how its presuppositions project. Although the modal implications of -ever free relative clauses are typically analyzed as a semantically-encoded component of their meaning, this work argues that a pragmatic explanation provides better coverage of a broad range of empirical observations.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004288/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004288<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Accepted at Semantics and Pragmatics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>questions, free-relatives, presuppositions, maximize presupposition, pragmatics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004288/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>210 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004288">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004288">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
