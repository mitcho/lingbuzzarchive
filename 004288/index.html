This work offers an explanation of these similarities based on well-established pragmatic principles. These constructions are proposed to evoke equally informative alternatives with stronger presuppositions, and when such alternatives are salient, the use of a know whether sentence or a sentence containing an ever-free relative requires the presuppositions of all of its alternatives not to be satisfied, a consequence of Heimâ€™s (1991) Maximize Presupposition. This gives rise to an ignorance requirement for unembedded occurrences of these constructions and other types of requirements for embedded occurrences as a result of how their presuppositions project. Although the implications of ever-free relatives are typically analyzed as a grammatical component of their meaning, this work argues that a pragmatic explanation provides better empirical coverage.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004288/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004288<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>draft submitted (comments welcome)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>questions, free-relatives, presuppositions, maximize presupposition, pragmatics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>87 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004288">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004288">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
