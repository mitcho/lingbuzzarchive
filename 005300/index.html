Dual Mechanism Model (DMM), as compared to a Single Mechanism Model 
(SMM), might inform our more narrow discussion of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) (discussed in Note 4), as well as inform our larger-scope discussions 
surrounding the ‘nature of language & design’ more generally. The description of our methods here will be based on the following dichotomies: 

[1] DMM vs. SMM
 
(i) Whereas an SMM is solely reliant on brute-force associations which are 
inherently tethered to overt 
Learning—a frequency endeavor [+Freq], where frequency of item-based learning belongs on the vertical mode of processing (to be presented and discussed below). Such item-based learning could be thought of as ‘structure-independent’ since its focus is solely on the isolated item in question 
and not on the context of overall structure surrounding the item. 

(ii) Whereas a DMM is abstract and rule-based which is inherently tethered to 
tacit, covert Acquisition—a [-Freq] endeavor which doesn’t rely on a one
-one association of item, but rather can be both (i) item-based and (ii) 
categorical in nature, where structure-dependency is observant of category over item. Hence a DMM mode—a mode which is both ‘item-based’ when called upon (e.g. such as lexical learning, irregular formation over rule-based regulars, etc.) and ‘categorical-based’ when called upon to engage in the manipulation of symbols—is in a unique position to deliver the kind of ‘learning curve’ which is consistent with what we find of native language acquisition (to be presented and discussed below). <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005300/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005300<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>unpublished ms.
