Progressive aspect is de&#64257;ned as a relation between topic time/reference time (in the sense of Klein 1994) and event time, where topic time/reference time is located inside 

the event time. The two main contexts of interests are the episodic present tense, as in we are playing football and past tense sentences with punctual temporal modi&#64257;ers that pick out a point 

in time located within the event, as in when I arrived, they were playing football. As is well 

known, in English the progressive form has to be used in these cases, unless the main predicate 

is stative. I will argue in this article that in English, only stative predicates and progressives 

can include a topic time. In Swedish, a simple tense form can be used in progressive contexts, 

though as will be shown, clearly telic predicates often force the topic time/reference time to be 

located before the event time (i.e. giving rise to a future or prospective reading), especially in 

the past, though less clearly so in the present tense. In other words, there is a clear difference 

between Swedish and English: while the topic time in English only can be located inside stative 

predicates, the topic time in Swedish can located inside at least all types of atelic predicates. I 

will claim that the main difference between English and Swedish is that topic time in English 

always is punctual, while topic time in Swedish at least can span a minimal stage of an event, 

in the terms of Taylor (1977). Further, I show that the state-event-distinction is relevant for 

Swedish as well, and whereas all verbs in the progressive tense show typical stative properties, 

non-stative verbs in the simple past or present tense do crucially not behave like states.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001107/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001107<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>tense, aspect, stative, progressive, swedish, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>744 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001107">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001107">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
