I do this by removing a stipulation from the definition of Merge, and by replacing functional categories qua lexical items with a function that directly labels structures. The removal of the stipulation in Merge allows unary branching structures which, in the new system, provide the structural carapace for sequences of (mainly functional)  categories; the labeling function recurses from the categories assigned to roots, assigning labels to ever larger structures on the basis of a universally given sequence of  categories (Cinque 1999, Starke (2001), obviating the need for functional heads. Unary branching labeled structures provide the locus for morphological realization so that what were previously considered to be functional lexical items are, in the new system, just spellouts of pieces of labeled structure. Standard binary Merge then provides the further structure necessary for negotiating the syntactic and semantic connections between sequences of categories. Part of the motivation for setting up the system in this way is that it provides us with a solution to a serious problem in the derivation of current phrase structural representations: how structures containing base generated specifiers are labeled. However, the system I develop also rules out a certain class of rollup and remnant movement analyses, replacing them with base generated `flipped' structures (Brody 2000, Adger Habour and Watkins 2009), reducing the analytical options available to syntactic structure building in a desirable way.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001252/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001252<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>a draft chapter of an in prep book - comments welcome</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>labels, specifiers, extended projection, argument introduction, minimalist syntax, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1026 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001252">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001252">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
