This phenomenon, known as copredication, raises various issues for linguistic theory. In this paper I defend and develop an approach to the issues of counting and individuation in copredication put forward in previous work (Gotham, 2017), in dialogue with
criticisms made by Liebesman & Magidor (2017, 2019) and their own positive account of copredication.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005905/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005905<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>This is a preprint version of an article that has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Semantics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>copredication, individuation, quantification, loose talk, category mistakes, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>240 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005905">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005905">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
