Evidence collected from native signers is presented to show that WH-R questions are semantically distinct from their WH-in situ counterparts. WH-R questions (a) carry non-null presuppositions, (b) are exhaustive and (c) are contrastive. An analysis is presented in which WH-R questions are syntactically derived via focus movement of the WH-element and remnant topicalization of the remaining clausal constituent. This analysis provides a means of accounting for the cleft-like semantic properties of the WH-R question as well as its behavior in identificational contexts and multiple WH-questions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001105/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001105<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of WCCFL 28</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>american sign language, wh-questions, clefting, improper movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>603 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001105">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001105">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
