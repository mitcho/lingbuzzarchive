I argue that the existence of perfectly thinkable thoughts is revealing in regard to the question of why syntactic islands should exist. If language is an instrument of thought as understood in the biolinguistics tradition, then a uniquely human subset of thoughts is generated in narrow syntax, which suggests that island constraints and the ungrammatical sentences they cause cannot be rooted in narrow syntax alone. This is because speakers must be able to mentally represent thoughts whose expression via sound/sign nevertheless violates island constraints. If islands were due to constraints on structure generation alone then that would leave unexplained perfectly thinkable thoughts. That is, it would leave unexplained why certain structures that have been generated are ungrammatical due to island constraints and yet their meaning is perfectly understandable. If we take interpretable sentences to be generated by narrow syntax and then explain their grammaticality or unacceptability in terms of interface relations, then this explains why we are able to interpret sentences with island violations. In other words, the existence of perfectly thinkable thoughts provides independent support for the claim that syntactic islands reflect interface conditions imposed on the output of the computational system and its mapping to external systems.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004556/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004556<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>draft - comments welcome</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>islands; locality; narrow syntax; language as an instrument of thought; perfectly thinkable thoughts, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>176 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004556">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004556">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
