Drawing on the results of controlled acceptability experiments, I present an original investigation of the understudied family of specificational copular amalgam sentences (e.g., She wrote about finiteness is what she did), which differs from canonical specificational copular sentences with respect to a number of syntactic and semantic properties. Copular amalgam sentences are finite, but their functional spine consists only of the C-domain, lacking projections of T and V and their respective syntactic and semantic functions (e.g., nominative case, tense). Finiteness can therefore be reduced to phenomena originating in the left periphery of the clause. These phenomena include [T] and [Ï†] inflection, the licensing of an independently referential subject, and independent anchoring of the proposition to the utterance context. Since C-domain heads can project in the absence of T and V, there can be no implicational relation between higher and lower heads in the functional sequence.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002702/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002702<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>CUNY Graduate Center</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>finiteness, specificational copular sentences, pseudoclefts, amalgams, extended projections, tense, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>977 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002702">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002702">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
