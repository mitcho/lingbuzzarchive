Since Geurts 1996, however, the promise of this research program has been tarnished by the observation that it systematically leads to incorrect predictions in cases where a presupposition ends up filtered which should not have been. I show that the satisfaction account of presupposition projection is in good stead, after all, by revealing that Geurts's observations are valid only under certain basic assumptions about semantic composition. To illustrate, I present a satisfaction account of presupposition projection that builds on the work of Charlow (2014, 2019a,b) in the context of a semantics based on alternatives, where, indeed, the proviso problem crops up. I slightly sophisticate the compositional repertoire, leading to a setting in which the proviso problem disappears. I additionally demonstrate some extensions of the proposed system for binding and presupposition accommodation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004914/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004914<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>presupposition, projection, dynamic semantics, compositionality, anaphora, scope, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004914/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>377 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004914">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004914">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
