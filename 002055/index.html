In this respect it is astonishing, that in my opinion from the Slavic side this subject was treated if at all very marginally in the past. My interest was motivated by the fact that Causatives and Anti-Causatives require an analysis, which touches an interface of morphology, semantics, lexicon, word formation and syntax. Therefore it is also replicable by the Minimalistic Program (with the inclusion of Distributive Morphology). Furthermore, the theme comprises important observations  concerning questions of affix ordering, syntactic structures and verb movement. Most syntactic accounts of affix ordering and verb movement follow the theory of incorporation by Mark Baker (1988). In this theory syntactic incorporation is assumed to be an instance of the general syntactic  rule Move Alpha, e.g. a syntactic operation that derives morphologically complex words from morphologically basic elements (root, stems, or affixes) by head to head  movement via incorporation. Whereas the traditional view on morphology and word formation is that word-formation takes place in lexicon, and that morphological rules are different in nature and apply on different primitive elements than syntactic rules, we shall try to advocate an analysis in which the phenomenon of Anti-Causatives and Causatives has to  be derived from different ROOT-Semantics of verbs projecting different trees and syntactic structures by  the operations AGREE and MERGE. The Causative Alternation (CAL) will  serve as criteria to distinguish between externally and internally caused causation; with help of the CAL the Unaccusativity will be divided into two  subgroups: alternating Unaccusative (AU-)  verbs and  non-alternating  Unaccusative (NAU-) verbs. In the following an alternate distinction between AU- and NAU-verbs will be developed, namely the presence/absence of  information about  how the process to be treated was caused.  The universal concept of the encyclopedic lexicon in English, German, Russian and Czech (partly also other European and non European languages) seems to assume four different ROOTS of verbs at base to  classify the Anti-Causativity-Opposition: 

√ agentive (murder, assassinate,cut),
√ internally caused (blossom, wilt, grow), 
√ externally caused (destroy, kill, slay) 
√cause unspecified (break, open,melt).
 
Moreover, it will be shown that unergative/causative pairs depict an independent phenomenon, which does not affect considerations about CAL (correspondent to Alexiadou et al. 2006a, b, Kosta 2010, 2011; and Marantz 1997, but dissenting Levin & Rappaport Hovav 1995 and Reinhart 2000). 

This talk is organized as follows: in section 1, I propose a formulation of the MP based on  syntactic features; the examples will be taken from Causatives and Anti-Causatives that are  derived by affixes (in Russian, Czech, Polish, German, English and some other languages of different types and origins) by head-to-head movement. 

In section 2, I review some basic facts in support of a syntactic approach to Merge of Causatives and Anti-Causatives, proposing that theta roles are also syntactic Features that merge functional affixes with their stems in a well-defined way.  I first try to give some external evidence in showing that Causatives and Anti-Causatives obey a principle of thematic hierarchy early postulated in generative literature by Jackendoff (1972; 43), and later reformulated in terms of argument-structure-ordering principle by Grimshaw (1990:chapter 2).  Crucial for my paper is the working hypothesis that every syntactic theory which tries to capture the data not only descriptively but also explanatively should descend from three levels of syntactic representation: a-structure where the relation between predicate and its arguments (and adjuncts) takes place, thematic structure where the theta-roles are assigned to their arguments, and event structure, which decides about the aspectual distribution and division of events.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002055/current.pdf">pdf</a> ][ <a href="/lingbuzz/002055/current.file">file</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002055<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>This paper is not yet fully developed but will be part oft he presentation at BASEES, Cambridge, April 2-4, 2014.
