licensing environment for negative polarity items (NPIs). Based on data from Greek, English,
Korean, Dutch, and American Sign Languageâ€”we show that strong NPIs do not appear in
comparatives and that weak NPIs are dispreferred. NPIs that do appear in the comparative are
rescued (in the sense of Giannakidou 2006), and are therefore not subject to licensing, because
rescuing happens without a nonveridical or negative licenser in the syntax. Free choice items, on
the other hand, appear in the comparatives systematically; and because they typically avoid
negation, their occurrence serves as evidence that the comparative is not a negative environment.
Strong NPIs appear in the comparative only if it contains an antiverdical (i.e., negative) operator,
such as the Korean negative metalinguistic comparative charari (Giannakidou and Yoon 2009,
2011). The implication of our analysis is that the comparative does not belong to the class of NPI
licensers, and is consistent with the long-standing observation in the literature that the
comparative lacks monotonic properties. Free choice items and NPIs with free choice or generic
readings are admitted because these items can refer to a class, and are therefore appropriate for
class comparisons.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003679/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003679<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>comparatives, negative polarity, free choice, greek, korean, dutch, asl, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003679/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2017]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>598 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003679">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003679">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
