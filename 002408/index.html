I am going to repair *(it) for her). In non-anaphoric contexts, however, English allows a null cognate object e as in Mary reads [e]every night whereas Chinese requires an overt cognate object (kan-shu,literally ‘read-book’). Previous SLA studies indicate Chinese learners of L2 English have problems unlearning anaphoric object drop in English, generally
ascribed to effects of L1 transfer. This study brings a novel perspective to
the L2 learnability problem by incorporating Cheng and Sybesma’s (1998)
proposed negative correlation between the two rules: that allowing object drop
in anaphoric contexts is incompatible with allowing object drop in
non-anaphoric contexts. The following questions are posed:
(1) To what extent can Chinese learners of English (CLE) learn the non-anaphoric null cognate object rule?
(2) To what extent do CLE use anaphoric object drop?
(3) To what extent does unlearning use of null objects in anaphoric contexts
correspond to learning use of null objects in non-anaphoric contexts?
This study tested 85 adult CLE in Hong Kong, with 22 native English speaker
controls, using an innovative battery of judgment and production tasks. The
findings demonstrated that CLE could be 100% target-like in using null
arbitrary cognate objects, but were more variable in using anaphoric object
drop (ranging from 60-100%). It is concluded that CLE are not necessarily
restricted by L1 transfer effects but can successfully learn the null
arbitrary cognate object interpretation rule for L2 English, and this seems to
demonstrate access to UG in L2 when there is learning under poverty of
stimulus. The difference in success between the two rule conditions show no
support for Cheng and Sybesma’s (1998) hypothesis that there is a connection
between allowing anaphoric object drop and disallowing non-anaphoric object
drop.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002408/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002408<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/handle/10443/2488</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>object drop, cognate object, chinese and english, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1154 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002408">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002408">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
