We show that simplex wh-elements do not contain any features other than [+wh]; in particular, they do not contain the features D (including its sub-features Person, Number, and Gender), Case, nor Animacy. This approach makes correct predictions on at least two accounts: (i) headless relatives are headed by simplex wh-words, and not by relative pronouns, due to the lack of features of the antecedent; and (ii) combined with Roberts’ (2010) theory of head movement, we derive the data of Bavarian and Alemannic doubly-filled complementizer constructions reported in Bayer and Brandner (2008) for embedded questions, which despite (possibly
cross-generational) speaker variation, crucially also represent our own grammar, and we also extend our analysis to doubly-filled complementizer effects in relative clauses in the same varieties.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006722/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006722<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the Olomouc Linguistics Colloquium 2021</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>shake your head, laugh, and keep it moving!, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>370 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006722">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006722">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
