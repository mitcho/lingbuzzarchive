expressive symbols that are incredibly widespread in computer-mediated communication
(CMC), especially among young people. The majority of linguistic research on emojis focuses
only on the semantics; however, emerging data suggest that emojis are far more linguistically
interesting than merely their semantic contributions to a sentence. Data from Twitter demonstrate
that emojis can actually appear as contentful morphological units that behave according to
regularly predictable morphosyntactic rules. In this paper I analyze data from several languages
including English, German, and Spanish and reach several conclusions about emojis that appear
as lexical items in sentences. First, these emojis are not merely replacements in text for existing
words in a language, but rather they represent morphological stems to which inflectional and
derivational affixes can be productively added. Second, emojis can undergo morphological
changes such lexicalization and grammaticalization. Within pro-speech emojis, I also
differentiate two sub-categories of emoji according to how they are interpreted: first, emojis
which seem to be a code for a different lexical item, and second, emojis whose interpretation is
entirely iconic, for which it is beneficial to say some of them are distinctly represented in the
language user’s lexicon.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007123/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007123<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>emojis, cmc, morphology, affixation, stems, inflection, derivation, lexicalization, grammaticalization, iconicity, pro-speech gestures</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>420 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007123">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007123">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
