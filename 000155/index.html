In pursuit of this goal, he proposes an extreme reduction of the descriptive apparatus, leaving many phenomena which received an account in earlier stages of the theory outside the scope of CHL (cf. Chomsky, 1995: 389, fn. 93). However, these phenomena must be accounted for in one way or another, if we want to prevent that a rise in explanatory adequacy goes at the expense of the descriptive adequacy of the system. Chomsky suggests that they should receive an account in the PF wing of the grammar, although he does not put forth a theory that can deal with these matters. We will show that OT syntax can fill this gap. More particularly, we will follow Pesetsky (1998), who argues for an OT system taking LF representations as its Input. The Generator of this OT system creates the relevant Candidate Set by applying the operation DELETE in a random fashion. This Candidate Set is subsequently evaluated with respect to a ranking of violable constraints. This enables Pesetsky to account for several filters proposed in the seventies, such as the Doubly Filled COMP Filter and the For-to Filter.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000155/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000155<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Joost Dekkers et al.
