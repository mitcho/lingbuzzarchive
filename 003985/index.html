This paper takes a closer look at predicates of truth (and related notions) when they apply to objects as the referents of referential noun phrases, focusing on what I call the ‘core’ of language. It argues that truth predicates and their variants, predicates of correctness, satisfaction and validity, do not apply to propositions (not even with that-clauses), but to a range of attitudinal and modal objects, objects we refer to as ‘claims’, ‘beliefs’, ‘judgments’, ‘demands’, ‘promises, ‘obligations’ etc. As such natural language reflects a notion of truth that is primarily a normative notion conveyed by correct. This normative notion, however, is not action-guiding, but rather constitutive of representational objects (in the sense of Jarvis 2012), independently of any actions that may go along with them. The paper furthermore argues that the predicate true is part of a larger class of satisfaction predicates (satisfied, realized, taken up, etc). The semantic differences among different satisfaction predicates, the paper will argue, are best accounted for in terms of a truthmaker theory along the lines of Fine’s truthmaker semantics. Truthmaker semantics also provides a notion of partial content applicable to attitudinal and modal objects, which may exhibit partial correctness, partial satisfaction, and partial validity.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003985/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003985<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Synthese, special issue 'Truth: Concept meets Property’, edited by Nicolaj Pedersen and Jeremy Wyatt</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>truth, sentential subjects, speech acts, direction of fit, propositions, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>188 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003985">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003985">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
