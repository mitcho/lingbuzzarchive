Although several aspects of Kurdish morphology have been studied, such as pronominal endoclitics and Izafa constructions, Sorani Kurdish morphology has received trivial attention in computational linguistics. Moreover, some morphemes, such as the emphasis endoclitic =îş, and derivational morphemes have not been previously studied. To tackle the complex morphology of Sorani, we provide a thorough description of Sorani Kurdish morphological and morphophonological constructions in a formal way such that they can be used as finite-state transducers for morphological analysis and synthesis. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006234/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006234<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sorani kurdish, central kurdish, formal morphology, inflectional morphology, lexeme-based morphology, computational linguistics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>383 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006234">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006234">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
