These results have opened up a set of new questions regarding how cumulativity operates in linguistic systems. We addressed these questions by bringing in a new type of evidence: data from sound symbolism. Two experiments on the sound symbolism in Pokémon names with native speakers of English show that (1) more than two factors (e.g. vowel quality, consonant voicing and name length) can cumulatively interact, (2) when two different factors are present (ganging cumulativity), their interaction is linearly cumulative, (3) when multiple instances of the same factor are present (counting cumulativity), their effects are sub-linearly cumulative, and (4) counting cumulativity and ganging-up cumulativity can coexist in a single system. While the current experiments may not provide a final answer to the questions on how cumulativity functions in linguistic patterns in general, our experiments can be understood as cases studies which shed light on how various linguistic factors interact when speakers make a linguistically informed judgment on sound symbolic patterns. The current case studies also suggest that it may be informative to study sound symbolism to explore the nature of linguistic patterns.   <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005243/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005243<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted (comments very welcome!)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>cumulativity, sound symbolism, pokémonastics, voicing, the iconicity of quantity, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>200 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005243">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005243">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
