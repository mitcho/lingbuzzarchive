Interestingly, few studies have explored effects of quantifier type on cognitive load during comprehension alone, in order to distinguish between quantifier characterization and verification procedures.
In this study, we address this distinction by examining the processing of quantified sentences in an auditory/visual verification task. 
We show quantifier-type influences on working memory usage as measured by  variations in pupil size during encoding and verification, and we relate these results to theories of quantifier meaning grounded in the approximate number system, and to previous results on quantifier complexity based on precise counting strategies.
