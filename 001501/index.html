That spans are a significant entity for syntax has been implicitly recognized in the Head Movement Constraint: A head may only move to the head selecting it, thus a head may only move within a span (e.g. V can move to T). Brody's Mirror theory goes so far as to equate spans with words (so if T and V do not form a word, then in that case VP is not the complement of T), replacing head movement with a linearization instruction for a complex head (e.g. a V-T word can spell out in V (English) or T (French)). This suggests a close connection between spell-out and spans, one which I develop in this paper. I claim the following: Spans are targets for morpheme insertion (so T-V could in principle be spelled out by a single morpheme, without any movement being necessary, and regardless of whether V also has a complement---contra Brody, a span is not necessarily a word). I develop this position through a close examination of a few portmanteau preposition-determiner forms in French (de+le=du, and à+le=au). The interaction of syntax and phonology in the selection of the correct allomorph sheds much light on the nature of spell-out and lexical insertion.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001501/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001501<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms. CASTL, University of Tromsø</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>spanning, spell-out, morphology, dm, distributed morphology, french, preposition, determiner, preposition-determiner fusion, allomorphy, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3719 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001501">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001501">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
