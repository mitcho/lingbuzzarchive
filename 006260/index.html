I argue that in the former cases the IA is syntactically present but in the latter cases it is actually absent, as its presence would block the A-dependency. If the IA were always there or always absent, the constructions/control relationships in question would not be expected to be licensed selectively. The very existence of such asymmetries suggests that IAs intervene in syntactic, and not merely semantic, representations. Such effects must be attributed to the varying feature specification of IAs and A-probes. The implications of these findings are twofold: (i) the syntactic, rather than merely semantic, status of IAs which can control into non-finite subordinate clauses is reinforced, while at the same time (ii) not all non-active constructions with agentive readings have syntactically realized IAs.
