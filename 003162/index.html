The k and má morphemes are distinguished based on mood. By default, the k morpheme is used in realis mood while the má morpheme is used in irrealis mood. Kìí, kò, and kọ́ are taken to be allomorphs of the k morpheme, which are distinguished based on aspect and focus. While describing these negative morphemes, the paper points out that they exhibit the kinds of mismatches described in Carlson (2006). Carlson argues that functional items pose greater challenges to language acquisition than lexical items because they often exhibit mismatches (between form and interpretation) which are not found for lexical items. The main purpose of this paper is to describe Yoruba negation; it only points out the mismatches to buttress some of the claims made in the paper and for further empirical investigation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003162/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003162<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>168 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003162">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003162">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
