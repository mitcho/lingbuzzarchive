It is argued that these four markers can be subcategorized into two morphemes: the k-morpheme and the má-morpheme. The k- and má-morphemes are distinguished based on mood. By default, the k-morpheme is used in realis mood while the má-morpheme is used in irrealis mood. Kìí, kò, and kọ́ are taken to be allomorphs of the k-morpheme, which are distinguished based on aspect and focus. It is also proposed that kọ́, which has been traditionally regarded as a NP negator, does not negate a NP but a Focus Phrase in which such NP is serving as an argument. While describing these negative morphemes, the paper points out that they exhibit the kinds of form-interpretation mismatches described for functional items in Carlson (2006). The main purpose of this paper is to describe Yoruba negation; it only points out the mismatches to buttress some of the claims made in the paper, for further empirical investigation, and to contribute to the discussion on form-interpretation mismatches.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003162/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003162<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003162/v2.pdf">v2 [December 2016]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003162/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1851 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003162">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003162">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
