plural and conjoined expressions, the internal readings of symmetrical
predicates such as "same" and "different", and the summative readings of
expressions such as "a total of $10,000". These expressions pose
significant challenges to compositional semantics, and have been
studied extensively in the literature. However, almost all previous
studies focus exclusively on one of these phenomena, and the close
parallels and interactions that they exhibit have been mostly
overlooked to date. We point out two key properties common to these
phenomena: (i) they target all types of coordination, including
right-node raising and dependent cluster coordination, two
representative types of non-canonical coordination; (ii) the three
phenomena all exhibit multiple dependency, both by themselves and with
respect to each other. These two parallels between the three phenomena
suggest that one and the same mechanism is at the core of their
semantics. Building on this intuition, we propose a unified analysis
of these phenomena, in which the meanings of expressions involving
coordination are formally modelled as tuples. The analysis is couched
in Hybrid Type-Logical Categorial Grammar. The flexible
syntax-semantics interface of this framework enables an analysis that
yields a simple and principled solution for both the interactions with
non-canonical coordination and the multiple dependency noted above.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002150/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002150<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in NLLT</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>`respective' reading; symmetrical predicate; parasitic scope; hypothetical reasoning; coordination; hybrid type-logical categorial grammar, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002150/v2.pdf">v2 [November 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002150/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2813 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002150">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002150">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
