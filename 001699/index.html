In §2, we note that a number of recent analyses take which to function as a subordinating conjunction in gapless relatives, but we argue against this view and provide evidence that the wh-word in such clauses is indeed a relative pronoun. In §3, we argue that the relative pronoun in gapless relatives serves as the object of a ‘silent’ preposition. In §4, we present an analysis under which a preposition can be silent when it (or its containing PP) undergoes a type of deletion operation called Ghosting. §5 shows how Ghosting (like other deletion operations) can serve to rescue structures which would otherwise induce constraint violations. §6 discusses gapless relatives which have a Topic-Comment interpretation, and argues for an extended Ghosting analysis under which a predicate of SAYING associated with the ghosted preposition is also ghosted. Our overall conclusion is that supposedly ‘gapless’ relatives are more properly analysed as containing a gap created by relativization of the object of a ghosted preposition.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001699/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001699<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>gapless relatives, ghosting, prepositions, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1184 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001699">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001699">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
