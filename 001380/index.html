Thus, 'John invited only Pia' has the components ‘John invited Pia’ and ‘John did not invite anyone else’. This paper proposes that an item like 'only', which contributes two meaning components opposite in polarity, cannot be in the scope of sentential negation at LF. We argue that it is a direct consequence of this restriction that that a sentence like 'John did not invite only Pia' has the reading ‘John invited not only Pia’, where 'not' is interpreted as constituent negation applying to only. We suggest that such "migration" of negation from sentence negation to constituent negation or vice versa is possible if the meaning that the surface structure suggests is unavailable due to the proposed restriction or other LF well-formedness conditions. We examine the interpretation of contrastive focus, DPs modified by focus-sensitive particles 'only', 'even' and 'also', and constituents of the form 'not Y but X'. In addition to 'only', contrastive focus and 'not Y but X' contribute two meaning components of opposite polarity. As a result, they show different interpretive behaviour from 'even' and 'also', which contribute two positive meaning components.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001380/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001380<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>focus, negation, focus-sensitive particles, contrast, lf-movement, positive polarity items, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>391 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001380">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001380">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
