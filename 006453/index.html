Generative Grammar, from its inception, has been chiefly concerned with biolinguistics – the study of language as a characteristic psychological and biological trait of the human species (Berwick & Chomsky, 2016; Chomsky, 1965, 2000). This focus, with an accompanying “parts list” of computational mechanisms, enables scientists to investigate questions about the neurological implementation of language (Sprouse & Hornstein, 2016). However, there is much disagreement regarding which brain structures are involved in processing different aspects of language, and how linguistic computations are implemented neurobiologically. This chapter will give an overview of much of the research and recent developments on this topic, with a focus on the extent to which the Minimalist Program has influenced and potentially sharpened our understanding of the relation between language and brain. In principle, Minimalism facilitates the search for the neurobiological basis of linguistic mechanisms because it seeks to reduce the domain-specific component that must be uncovered in the brain to a minimum (Berwick et al., 2011). However, much of the research reviewed in this chapter has a somewhat unsatisfying localizationist character. As Jerry Fodor once said, “If the mind happens in space at all, it happens somewhere north of the neck. What exactly turns on knowing how far north?” (Fodor, 1999). Such maps problems (Poeppel, 2012) dominate research in cognitive neuroscience, and do not offer explanations of how the human brain gives rise to the language faculty. However, the aspiration espoused in this chapter is that addressing the maps problems may help the development of such explanations.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006453/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006453<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cambridge Handbook of Minimalism</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>minimalist program; brain, aphasia, neuroimaging, lesion-symptom mapping, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>437 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006453">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006453">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
