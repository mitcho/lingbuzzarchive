The main reason of failure is the SVO bias. The hypothesis demonstrably misses the mark for languages with head-final VPs. Data from an OV-based language like German are sufficient for rebutting the representativeness of the original data basis. When the hypothesis and its predictions are systematically confronted with data from such a language, it fails. The results have immediate consequences for current claims within the Minimalist Program, with "little-v" as the theta-assigner of such (transitive) subjects. 
Crucially, the subject position is VP-external only in [S[VO]] languages. It is one of the type-defining properties. In SOV and also in VSO languages, a subject stays in its VP-internal base position (unless it is wh-moved). As for little v, the fact that complex head-initial VPs contain an empty V position is a derivable property. However, 'little v' as an empty verb with inherent grammatical properties is a readily dispensable concept. The obligatory, VP-external structural subject position is a predictable and derivable property of [S[VO]] languages. It is absent in SOV and VSO languages. There is neither empirical need nor theoretical necessity for an idiosyncratic "little v" or a universal VP-external functional subject position ("EPP").<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005467/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005467<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>little v, structural subject position, epp, external theta role for subjects, svo, sov, head-final, head-initial, idioms, collocations, adverb placement, lexical argument structure</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005467/v7.pdf">v7 [October 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005467/v6.pdf">v6 [October 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005467/v5.pdf">v5 [October 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005467/v4.pdf">v4 [October 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005467/v3.pdf">v3 [September 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005467/v2.pdf">v2 [September 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005467/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>470 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005467">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005467">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
