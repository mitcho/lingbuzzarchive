With respect to phonological behaviour, both types of composite structures undergo vowel raising at the right edge of each element in the construction and vowel sandhi processes between their elements. In this paper, I show that word-word compounds and stressed aﬃx + word structures exhibit signiﬁcant diﬀerences in stress assignment in BP, which supports their prosodization in two separate domains. While stressed aﬃx + word structures are assigned primary and secondary stress as simple phonological words (PWds), each element in word-word compounds behaves as an independent PWd with regard to stress assignment. I thus propose that while stressed aﬃx + word structures are recursively prosodized in the PWd domain, word-word compounds are prosodized in the composite group, the domain proposed by Vogel (2008, 2009) that immediately dominates the PWd and accounts for the prosodization of structures with compositional characteristics. My analysis reconciles two views on prosodic structure that are traditionally assumed to be mutually exclusive: the view that prosodic domains can be recursive (e.g. Inkelas (1990), Selkirk (1996)) and the view that the prosodic hierarchy includes an additional domain speciﬁc to composite structures above the PWd (e.g Vogel (2009)).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002777/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002777<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>word-word compounds, stressed affix + word structures, prosodic phonology, brazilian portuguese, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002777/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>568 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002777">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002777">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
