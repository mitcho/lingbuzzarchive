This intuition, though, is not captured by the entries most often assigned to this particle, namely ‘non-scalar’ and ‘scalar’ entries, asserting the falsehood of all / all stronger alternatives to the prejacent, p, in C, respectively. An entry which gets closer to capturing this mirror imaged relation is what I call a ‘hybrid’ entry (cf. Guerzoni 2003) presupposing all alternatives to p in C to be stronger than it and asserting all distinct alternatives in C to be false. In this paper I supply novel arguments for preferring this entry over the more commonly used entries. I show that using the ‘hybrid’ entry allows a straightforward explanation of the infelicity of ‘only’ in the presence of some discourse salient material, and the fact that this infelicity parallels infelicity of ‘even’ in mirror imaged cases. In contrast, neither ‘non-scalar’ nor ‘scalar’ entries can capture this infelicity, crucially not even when augmented with  ‘mirativity/evaluativity’ (or ‘non-vacuity’) constraints. I argue that this is because, unlike ‘even’, which is a true evaluative particle (presupposing a ‘higher than the standard’ degree for both p and its alternatives), mirativity / evaluativity (indicating ‘lower than expected’ / ‘lower than the standard’) is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the felicity of ‘only’, and should not be hardwired into its semantics. Instead I suggest a way to derive mirative / evaluative effects of ‘only’, as well as cases where these effects disappear, from the ‘hybrid’ entry and some assumptions about accommodation of alternatives into C. 
Thus, besides the mirror imaged scalar ordering (between p and its all distinct alternatives in C), ‘only’ and ‘even’ should not be seen as ‘mirative / evaluative’ mirror images. Neither should they be taken as mirror images in terms of exclusivity vs. additivity, due to  independently made claims indicating that ‘even’ is not a true additive particle. I show that adopting the ‘hybrid’ entry of ‘only’ (but not the ‘non-scalar’ or ‘scalar’ entries), where scalarity and exclusivity are separated components, allows us to capture this limited mirror imaged picture, and take ‘only’ to be a member of the typology of scalar particles cross linguistically. Finally, I discuss parallel challenges for the universal quantification over alternatives in the scalar presuppositions of both ‘only’ and ‘even’, and argue that they can be uniformly solved by appropriately constraining the balance between the contribution of discourse salient material vs. lexicon for constructing alternatives in C, though the precise way to do that still requires research.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004400/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004400<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>only, even, scalar presupposition, focus, alternatives, mirativity, exclusive, additive, context, lexicon, typologies, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004400/v3.pdf">v3 [February 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004400/v2.pdf">v2 [January 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004400/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>363 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004400">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004400">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
