representation are inevitable in modeling distinct domains of language such as phonetics
vs. syntax. However, there is also a long tradition in linguistics of using
multiple representations to analyze phenomena assumed to fall within a single domain
of language. The positing of “deep” and “surface” structures starting from
early Generative Grammar is just one example. These sets of multiple representations
have been variously referred to as “levels” or “strata”, often without it being
clear what, if anything, was at stake in the choice of terminology. However, the
decision to use one or more representations to model a single domain of language
has theoretical, empirical, and methodological consequences. Ladusaw 1985 highlighted
an especially crucial, but underdiscussed, aspect of this decision: whether
multiple representations involve the same theoretical vocabulary (multiple strata)
or different theoretical vocabularies (multiple levels). In this article I update this
discussion by showing how decisions about multiple syntactic representations look
rather different once one sees a reason to posit multiple semantic representations.
The discussion highlights the importance of not just within-domain but also crossdomain
considerations when making representational choices in linguistic modeling:
Decisions about the deployment of representational levels and strata in one domain
can influence our understanding of (and modeling decisions about) another.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007715/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007715<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in the Oxford Handbook of the Philosophy of Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>level; strata; linguistic representation; syntactic theory; semantic theory, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>68 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007715">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007715">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
