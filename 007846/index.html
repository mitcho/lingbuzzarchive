This dissertation provides a uniform treatment for the two distinct cleft constructions in Mandarin. Both cleft constructions involve a copular clause, minimally differ by the existence of a de particle at the sentence-final position and are otherwise identical in structure, hence the terms bare-shi cleft and shi...de cleft. The study begins with a detailed empirical survey of the distributional properties of the two Mandarin cleft types, with a focus on an analysis of individual subtypes defined on the constituents under focus, i.e. DP, PP, adjunct and CP clefts. Following the behavioral analysis the study turns to the semantic side, with experiments conducted to test whether the de particle is involved in encoding an exhaustive inference in shi...de clefts. In view of the experimental results indicating that the de particle does not contribute to a stronger exhaustive interpretation, a new explanation of the function of the de particle is offered. Making reference to the tools of cross-entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence, it is proposed that de acts as an information maximizer in the shi...de cleft. Additional evidence is then presented to motivate the claim that the information maximizer de is to be distinguished from a stand-alone evidential operator de that encodes a contrary-to-expectation meaning. The rest of the dissertation is devoted to a formal syntactic analysis with the aim of capturing the behavioral/distributional properties, deriving a weak exhaustive inference and explaining an independently observed constraint against object clefts. The contributions of this dissertation are three-fold. Empirically, to my knowledge, it is the first experimental work on Mandarin clefts to compare the two cleft construction types directly and present empirical evidence showing the existence of a second, non-cleft use of the sentence-final particle de. Theoretically, this work provides a syntactic implementation of the cleft structure which improves upon existing biclausal syntactic proposals. Methodologically, up-to-date psycholinguistic techniques, including acceptability judgment tasks and self-paced reading tasks, are applied to enable a systematic, rigorous test of the hypotheses in question. Also, Rational Speech Act (RSA)-based models are also employed to formalize the function of the de particle in cleft constructions. Last but not least, the chapters in this dissertation, as a whole, bridge experimental and theoretical approaches to Mandarin clefts. I hope this dissertation can be a meaningful first step towards integrating the full range of available methodologies into a more general theory of cleft structures and their interpretation.
