The child progresses through several stages of acquisition that cannot easily be explained as a function of the input or by processing limitations.  The child data find explanation in LandauÂ’s (2000, 2004, 2006) Agree-based theory of control, which analyzes the cross-linguistic range of complement types as resulting from different combinations of Tense and Agreement features on the I and C heads. The acquisition stages reflect changing grammatical hypotheses about the feature composition of possible complements for want. For both control and RtO, the child initially attempts a subjunctive complement. RtO structures are acquired late as they require the additional step of CP truncation. The proposal is compared with the predictions made by theories of control based on predication, binding and movement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000812/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000812<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>control, raising to object, language acquisition, infinitival clauses, subjunctive clauses, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>370 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000812">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000812">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
