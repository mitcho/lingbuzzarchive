Although the language is known to allow high flexibility in the ordering of major constituents in the clause, the principles that determine speakersâ€™ preferences among possible orders are not extensively described. We claim that a more comprehensive view of Cherokee grammar can be obtained by examining quantitative variation in word order in an annotated corpus of spoken narratives. Specifically, we investigate the properties that best predict the order of nominal and adverbial constituents relative to verbs, and the relative order among nominal and adverbial constituents. First, we confirm the effects of information-structural factors (referential accessibility and contrast) described in previous works, but find their influence to be probabilistic, rather than categorical. Second, we show that thematic roles (e.g. agents vs. themes) play an independent role in word order preferences. We use a logistic regression model to confirm that both types of factors interact cumulatively to influence word order probabilities. We further show that the principles we identify successfully explain the distribution of discontinuous nominal expressions in Cherokee. As broader theoretical contributions, our findings support claims that there is no strict division among languages based on whether thematic properties have any influence on word order, and that formal models should account for such probabilistic and cumulative patterns. Finally, our results suggest that annotated corpus methods can play a useful role in the documentation of typologically similar languages with variable word order in the clause. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007444/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007444<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted article manuscript</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>cherokee, syntax, word order, corpus linguistics, variability, cumulativity, information structure, thematic roles, discontinuous nominal expressions, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>171 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007444">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007444">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
