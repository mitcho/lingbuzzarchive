phrasal displacement and discontinuity are constrained in natural language. These
patterns reveal, I argue, that many limitations of syntactic derivations are attributable
to the way in which syntactic operations are cyclically interleaved with the component
of the grammar that establishes word order. This finding has consequences for
many phenomena, and for the architecture of grammar in general.
Chapter 1 introduces the theory of cyclic linearization that serves as the foundation
for this work, and several principles about the locality of movement that
importantly interact with it. Chapter 2 shows that these concepts predict the crosslinguistic
distribution of stranding in intermediate positions. Chapter 3 extends
these considerations to an analysis of possessor extraction in colloquial English, a
phenomenon subject to numerous intricate but systematic limitations. Chapter 4
provides further evidence for the theory advanced here from constraints on subextraction
in Russian. Chapter 5 argues that certain facts about parasitic gaps in
sentences with overlapping moved phrases reveal further evidence that linearization
constrains syntactic derivations, with consequences for the nature of movement
more generally. Chapter 6 argues that linear order constrains extraposition, and proposes
an account of this phenomenon that addresses a number of puzzles about its
distribution. Chapter 7 diverges from the theme of linearization to explore parasitic
gaps in relative clauses, which connect to several results from chapter 5. Chapter
8 summarizes the findings of this dissertation, and discusses several more general
implications of the framework advanced here.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005423/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005423<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>MIT doctoral dissertation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, phases, linearization, (anti)locality, pied-piping, sub-extraction, possessor extraction, left branch extraction, parasitic gaps, multiple specifiers, extraposition, relative clauses</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1031 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005423">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005423">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
