I review some of the more successful  attempts at characterizing register linguistically and give an overview of Bibers multi-dimensional techniques, where register is viewed as varying along several dimensions. I review the most salient of his dimensions, Dim. 1, Informational vs. Interactive, and examine some of the features which characterize it in English. I then show that these features act in Icelandic as in English: the more informational features are more prevalent in online newspapers and the more interactive features are more prevalent in online blogs. I also look at the distribution of two Icelandic-unique syntactic structures, impersonal topicalization in main clauses and stylistic fronting in relative clauses, and show that their variation depends on register. Newspapers, as the informational register, prefer a more compact delivery of information, and in both structures prefer the variant which requires movement. Blogs, on the other hand, prefer the syntactic variants which avoid movement.

I discuss the significance of featural-distribution analysis in corpora by describing a few recent studies which have used distributions to shed light on various aspects of generative grammar. I finish by describing register variation as an acquired language variety which exploits a basic grammar in ways that speakers/users acquire by exposure. That is, features such as elaborated noun phrases and preference for finite be become tacit knowledge at various levels of competence on the part of the language-user. I give a number of reasons why Icelandic might be a logical next choice for a multi-dimensional study: it is similar to and different from English in theoretically crucial ways which could shed light on universals or universal tendencies of register variation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000342/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000342<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Unpublished</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>registers, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>205 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000342">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000342">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
