"Enough" constructions (be ADJ enough to P) license a complex, variable, and aspect-sensitive pattern of complement inferences, in certain cases mimicking the inferential profile of complement-entailing implicative verbs (Karttunen 1971, Hacquard 2005).  This paper presents a survey of the inferential behaviour of English and French  "enough" constructions, arguing that complement inferences arise only in the context of a specific conspiracy of lexical, compositional, and contextual features.  Building on von Stechow et al (2004), I offer a semantic analysis which derives the observed inferential patterns, treating "enough" constructions as claims which attribute to their subjects the stative capacity for complement-realization, in view of some allocation of the matrix property ADJ.  Where ADJ introduces a dynamic (action-oriented, dispositional) property and background knowledge supports a causal relationship between ADJ-characterized action and the "enough" complement, complement entailments follow just in case the utterance context further demands an eventive interpretation for the matrix property attribution; such contexts trigger a special, evidential form of aspectual coercion (Fernald 1999) which applies selectively to dynamic-property statives and returns a predicate of evidentiary actions for the property in question.    The analysis makes good on Hacquard's (2005) intuition that "enough"'s inferences are genuine instances of implicativity by unifying the former with Nadathur's (2023) causal account of lexical implicative semantics: more broadly, it suggests a deep connection between implicativity, causal reasoning and the semantics of (un)realized ability (Bhatt 1999).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007793/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007793<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>implicatives, causal reasoning, &quot;enough&quot; constructions, aspect, aspectual coercion, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007793/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2023]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>299 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007793">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007793">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
