This paper addresses the topic of Pair Merge, or adjunction. It suggests that Pair Merge is subject to a restriction called the Merge Condition on Adjuncts. While Set Merge is contingent on the feature specifications of the heads of the two merging elements, the Merge Condition on Adjuncts states that an adjunct must merge in accordance with the feature specifications of its own head. Two edge features are available: [+ Predicational] and [- Predicational]. Only the former forces the adjunct to function as an open predicate and to establish a predication dependency – or a subject-predicate relation – with an element in the matrix clause. This requirement is syntactic, and it overrides the semantic specifications of adjuncts. Support comes from adjunct control into circumstantial clauses in Lebanese Arabic.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003050/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003050<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Perspectives on Arabic Linguistics 29.
