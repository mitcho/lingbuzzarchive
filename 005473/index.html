stimuli and neural activity. Despite clear evidence that the brain tracks speech at low frequencies
(~ 1 Hz), it is not well understood what linguistic information gives rise to this rhythm. In this study,
we harness linguistic theory to draw attention to Intonation Units (IUs), a fundamental prosodic unit
of human language, and characterize their temporal structure as captured in the speech envelope,
an acoustic representation relevant to the neural processing of speech. IUs are defined by a specific
pattern of syllable delivery, together with resets in pitch and articulatory force. Linguistic studies of
spontaneous speech indicate that this prosodic segmentation paces new information in language use
across diverse languages. Therefore, IUs provide a universal structural cue for the cognitive dynamics
of speech production and comprehension. We study the relation between IUs and periodicities in
the speech envelope, applying methods from investigations of neural synchronization. Our sample
includes recordings from every-day speech contexts of over 100 speakers and six languages. We find
that sequences of IUs form a consistent low-frequency rhythm and constitute a significant periodic
cue within the speech envelope. Our findings allow to predict that IUs are utilized by the neural system
when tracking speech. The methods we introduce here facilitate testing this prediction in the future
(i.e., with physiological data).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005473/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005473<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Scientific Reports</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>intonation, speech processing, prosody, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>410 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005473">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005473">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
