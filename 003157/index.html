Such state of affairs is explained if focused phrases (when moved) are moved in the PF component of grammar, as argued by Aoun and Benmamoun 1996. Wh-phrases are argued to behave differently (being moved in the syntax) due to the presence of a wh-feature, which is moved to the Spec of CP during the syntactic derivation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003157/current.docx">docx</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003157<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Studies</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>focus movement, topicalization, brazilian portuguese, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>401 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003157">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003157">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
