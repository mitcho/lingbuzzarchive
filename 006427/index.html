I have already placed a draft replacement for what was chapter 1 on lingbuzz, under the title “Linguistics begins: the biological paradigm”; here is a draft of a largely new introductory chapter, which is largely about how the constraints on all scholarship have changed since 1980.  As always, any comments would be very gratefully received at my e-mail address sampson@cantab.net, and the eventual published book will acknowledge any such help I use.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006427/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006427<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>history of linguistics, schools of linguistics, research assessment, publish or perish, syntax, phonology, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>394 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006427">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006427">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
