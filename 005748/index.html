Given the change in methodology, it is important to know how remote recording might alter the acoustic signal, either based on different recording devices used by participants and consultants recording themselves or based on video-conferencing software used to make interactive recordings. This study investigates audio signal fidelity across different in-person recording equipment and remote recording software when compared to a solid-state digital recording device that is representative of the standard used in-person for elicitation and fieldwork. We show that the choice of equipment and software can have a large effect on acoustic measurements, including measurements of frequency, duration, and noise. The issues do not just reflect decreased reliability of measurements; some measurements are systematically shifted in particular recording conditions. These results show the importance of carefully considering and documenting equipment choices. In particular, any cross-linguistic or cross-speaker comparison needs to account for possible effects of differences in which devices or software platforms were used.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005748/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005748<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>2021, Language</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>fieldwork, software, phonetics, compression, contrast maintenance, contrast measurement, language documentation, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005748/v3.pdf">v3 [June 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005748/v2.pdf">v2 [February 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005748/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>5098 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005748">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005748?_s=a9Nz9x6Y1xDARUW4&amp;_k=Wyan6M4jesT9MiA-&amp;10">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
