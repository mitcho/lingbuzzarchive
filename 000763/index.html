Based on cross-linguistic data showing that different types of paths are of different complexity and, crucially, are subject to a morphological containment relationship, I propose a more detailed structure for directionals. 

I adopt the orthodox view that Goal paths are built on top of a locative Place projection. However, I suggest that Source paths are built on top of Goal paths. This is evidenced by the morphological make-up of Source-denoting elements in a variety of languages, where the Source marker morphologically contains the Goal marker. Further, I explore the lexicalization of the decomposed Path structure I defend and test the predictions against the empirical domain of syncretisms between the spatial roles Source, Goal, and Location. I show that the decomposed Path structure and the lexicalization theory I adopt capture syncretism patterns that are widely attested among languages and ban those syncretism patterns that are unattested.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000763/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000763<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Linguistics 48.5</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>goal, source, location, path, spatial cases, superset principle, syncretism, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000763/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2008]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2038 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000763">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000763">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
