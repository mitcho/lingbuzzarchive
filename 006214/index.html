On Multiple Specifiers and the Locality of Movement]

We use fieldwork data about cross-clausal scrambling in Balkar (Turkic) to clarify the nature of movement and the factors that constrain it, with an emphasis on phase theory and the successive-cyclic movement that it entails. Balkar has a variety of embedded nominalized clauses, which are differentiated by the case of their subject. Clauses with nominative subjects permit cross-clausal object extraction but not subject extraction. In contrast, clauses with accusative subjects permit both such movements, though movement of the subject is required for object extraction. Finally, clauses with genitive subjects permit only subject extraction. We argue that these facts provide evidence for the following proposals: 1. multiple specifiers of one phase are usually possible provided that tucking-in applies, 2. higher specifiers are privileged for accessibility, 3. subject movement is constrained by anti-locality (a ban on short movements), and 4. Balkar DPs do not permit multiple specifiers. These factors are intertwined in an informative way in Balkar, and are supported by additional facts about possessors, binding, and covert movement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006214/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006214<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted (Revised version)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>scrambling, phases, multiple specifiers, case, (anti-)locality, balkar, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006214/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>407 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006214">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006214">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
