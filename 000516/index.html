Unlike long-distance agreement, it would necessarily violate the Phase Impenetrability Condition.  All examples that have been analyzed in terms of long-distance case actually involve the appearance of the nominative as the default case.  Cases that are actually assigned -- the accusative and the non-structural cases -- always obey locality.  Yet assignment of the accusative does appear to violate cyclicity.  This problem can however be solved as well with the right view on when case is assigned, once the dependency between structural accusatives and other DPs is properly understood.  As a result, the alternative solution put forward by Sigur&eth;sson (2006), requiring that subjects first-merge lower than objects, is shown to be unnecessary.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000516/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000516<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dm, distributed morphology, case, locality, cyclicity, long-distance agreement, long-distance case-assignment, phase, structural case, default case, icelandic, english, ecm, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2229 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000516">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000516">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
