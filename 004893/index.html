Based on the data on head nods and a gestural-intonational cluster used to question the rationale behind the antecedent speech act in Russian responses, it argues that gestures and intonational contours should be treated on a par with spoken morphemes when it comes to fitting them into typologies of meaning-encoding expressions. It also shows, based on the data on linear placement of gestural and spoken polarity markers as well as prosodic grouping in Russian (and English) polar responses, that studying gestural content and prosodic properties of utterances can help us reveal various interface constraints in natural language.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004893/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004893<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of FASL 28 (first draft)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>polar responses, polarity markers, gestures, intonation, prosodic grouping, semantics, intonational phonology, pragmatics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>177 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004893">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004893">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
