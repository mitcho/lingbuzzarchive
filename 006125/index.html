modal verbs (e.g., must, could) with their root meanings (e.g., abilities,
obligations) by age 2, typically a year or more earlier than with their epistemic
meanings (e.g., inferences). Established explanations for this
“Epistemic Gap” argue that epistemic language production is delayed
because small children can only reason about root meanings. However,
root and epistemic uses of modal verbs also differ syntactically and in
input representation. We present a corpus study on 17 English-learning
children and their input, exploring early productions with both epistemic
modal verbs and grammatically simpler and more frequent epistemic
adverbs (e.g., maybe, probably). Results show that children use remarkably
adult-like epistemic adverb sentences from even before age 2, when they are
only producing modal verbs with root meanings. The Epistemic Gap is not
well explained by general conceptual advancements. Instead, our data suggest
input attestation and ease of form-to-meaning mapping may influence
early child epistemic language. These findings are furthermore consistent
with cross-linguistic differences in the timing of first epistemic uses of modal
verbs, and with recent advancements in our understanding of infant and
toddler modal reasoning abilities.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006125/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006125<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Language Acquisition (2021)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>modals, modality, acquisition, epistemic, theory of mind, adverbs, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>170 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006125">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006125">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
