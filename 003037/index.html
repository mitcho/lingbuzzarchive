Specifically, I look at inference patterns involving superlative quantifiers ("at least m", "at most m"), which give rise to epistemic implications, and comparative quantifiers ("more than n", "fewer than n"), which do not. I identify an asymmetry in the inference patterns involving superlative quantifiers that I argue is not readily explained by either of two competing theories of superlative quantifiers. The solution I propose is that subjects in inferential tasks make certain default (but defeasible) assumptions: anything that is not known to be false is assumed to possibly be true. This proposal makes a number of predictions regarding inference patterns with overt epistemic modals, which I show are broadly correct. The end result suggests a new point of divergence between the notion of semantic entailment and that of an intuitively valid inference.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003037/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003037<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>First evaluation paper, McGill University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>modified numerals, ignorance inferences, scalar implicature, epistemic modality, nonmonotonic reasoning, default reasoning, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>213 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003037">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003037">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
