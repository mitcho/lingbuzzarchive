The minimally different options allowed by the grammars of the ItaloRomance varieties considered are syntactically driven by the same mechanisms at work in Standard Italian complex PPs, i. e., small Ps are selected according to: (i) the interrelated movement/merge of PLACE to the edge of DPPlace and of AxParts in PPdir/PPstat, and (ii) the pronominal vs. nominal nature of the Ground. The microcomparative perspective adopted sheds some light into the possession relation between the Ground and PLACE, and ultimately into the nature of PLACE itself: when PLACE and AxParts remain in situ an external possession relation yields, and the DP Ground is marked for genitive, while, if PLACE is moved/merged to the edge of DPPlace and AxPart is moved/merged in PPdir/stat, the Ground appears in a Construct State-like configuration with it. In addition, such configurations still emerge with pronominal Grounds, yet in a different marking, i. e. genitive, given the restrictor-less internal structure of pronouns.  All this entails that movement of AxParts, movement of PLACE and the internal structure of Ground are intimately related, and PLACE should be thought of as a sort of relational noun, as microcomparative data from Southern Italian varieties show that pronominal Grounds take the same possession marking of pronominal possessors of relational nouns such as kinship terms and/or body parts. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003515/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003515<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>locative adpositions, pp, italian dialects, dpplace, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>193 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003515">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003515">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
