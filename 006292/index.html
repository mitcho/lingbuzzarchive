and the ability to represent what others are saying, thinking etc.. I’m using the Pirahã controversy as a lens through which to study this relationship because, supposedly, the Pirahã language has no clausal embedding and hence no analogue of English indirect discourse (‘Katy said/thought/dreamed that she was rich’). I first show how hearsay evidentiality and direct quotation, both of which are attested in Pirahã, differ semantically from each other and from indirect discourse. However, together, these two arguably embedding-free report strategies could cover two of the most common uses of indirect discourse in English, viz. efficient communication that keeps track of speaker’s evidential sources through a not-at-issue information channel, and vivid description of speech and thought in narratives. I also argue that reporting in general is best understood as a discourse phenomenon, only optionally encoded in the grammar. Spelling this out in a formally explicit and independently motivated general model of discourse structure and coherence relations (including a non-veridical relation of Attribution) we actually derive Dan Everett’s own diagnosis of
the situation, viz. that "there can be recursive discourses in the absence of recursive sentences."<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006292/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006292<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>clausal embedding, evidentiality, perspective, quotation, direct vs. indi- rect discourse, recursion, pirahã, role shift, discourse structure, coherence, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006292/v2.pdf">v2 [August 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006292/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1330 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006292">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006292">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
