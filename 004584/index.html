Based on crosslinguistic data, we argue against both aspects of the traditional view. First, it incorrectly predicts that V-to-T movement and do-support should not cooccur in a language. And second, it does not capture crosslinguistic generalizations about which inflectional heads are supported by do. We develop an analysis of do-support as the outcome of chain splitting, in which a relation between V and T is successfully established and only later split. The successful formation of a head chain (containing V, T, and possibly other heads) accounts for the fact that languages with V-to-T movement may exhibit do-support, and derives the attested do-insertion positions from independent properties of head chains in a given language.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004584/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004584<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of NELS 49</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>do-support, head movement, lowering, danish, (british) english, monnese, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>529 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004584">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004584">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
