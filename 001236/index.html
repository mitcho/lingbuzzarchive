has at least implicitly been recognized in all linguistic theories. The most recent

development posits that movement is forced by morphological requirements

(Chomsky 1995). In this paper I will suggest a different approach to movement,

suggesting that it is essentially related to the geometry of phrase structure. A

weak version of Kayne's 1994 theory of the antisymmetry of syntax, namely

`dynamic antisymmetry' will be introduced. In the strong version, UG only

allowed for antisymmetrical configurations, in terms of c-command. Within

dynamic antisymmetry, however, symmetrical configurations can be generated,

provided that movement makes them antisymmetric before spell-out. In other

words, I will suggest that movement is a symmetry-breaking phenomenon, i.e.

it is triggered by purely geometrical factors as opposed to morphological ones.

Data will range from small clause constructions (both in copular sentences and

believe-type verbs) to wh-movement in interrogatives. Italian and English will

be the major sources of examples.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001236/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001236<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Studia Linguistica 51(1) 1997, pp. 50Â±76.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>symmetry, movement, interface, phrase structure, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>222 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001236">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001236">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
