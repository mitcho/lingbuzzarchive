The present study is the first to explore how children’s comprehension of A’-dependencies in French (relative clauses/RCs vs. Wh-questions) is modulated by the interaction between (1) the featural make-up of the head of the chain (bare vs. lexically-restricted/LR) and (2) its option to undergo movement or remain in-situ. As such, our study complements the previous production studies on the developmental order of these structures in French children. 
	Two experiments involving a picture-selection task were conducted with 72 French monolingual children. Experiment 1 investigated the comprehension of subject and object restricted RCs. Experiment 2 tested the comprehension of Wh-questions manipulating four conditions (i) the type of A’-dependency, (ii) the featural make-up of the Wh-element, (iii) its movement to [Spec,CP], and (iv) the overt filling of C° in object questions. 	
	All children were at ceiling for subject and in-situ object questions, both when the Wh-element was different from (bare) and similar to (lexically-restricted) the subject. Children had most difficulties processing LR object ex-situ questions and object RCs, the former being significantly less accurate than the latter. Moreover, although comprehension of ex-situ object questions improved in the presence of an overt C° (ESK), the bare vs. LR asymmetry was still present.
	The results obtained confirm that children’s difficulties with object A’-dependencies arise when the A’-moved object bears similar features to the subject intervening between the moved element and its trace, i.e. both for (ex-situ) questions and RCs involving an LR. Difficulties increase when this A’-movement is optional, as is the case for French Wh-questions but not for French RCs. This indicates that what affects comprehension is the interplay between overt “optional” movement and the featural specification of the target and the intervener, which we interpret as intervention effects reminiscent of the locality principle of Relativized Minimality. No such intervention effects arise for bare and LR object in-situ questions, which interestingly bears on the syntactic analysis of Wh in-situ in French. Furthermore, unlike what has been proposed for production, our data show that the presence of ESK has a facilitation effect illustrating that the merger of this element does not increase complexity for comprehension.
