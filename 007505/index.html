This paper contributes to this debate by probing into an under-appreciated aspect of the issue: whether the lack of focus (Defocus), instead of the presence of focus, may lead to syntax-prosody mismatches. We investigate a variant of right-dislocated structures, dislocation copying (DC) in Cantonese and Mandarin, both of which do not involve focus-rephrasing effects. We show that while DC has a biclausal structure syntactically (2 CPs), it consists of only one intonational phrase prosodically (1 ι). We argue that this mismatch is due to defocus in the right-dislocated chunks where focus interpretation is systematically banned. We propose that defocus cannot receive head prominence and leads to an illegitimate headless intonational phrase, and hence triggers the rephrasing. This proposal represents a defocus rephrasing view that weakens the rephrasing view by dissociating the role of defocus in prosody from that of focus.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007505/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007505<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Proceedings of CLS 59</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax-prosody interface, syntax-prosody mismatch, defocus, right dislocation, intonational phrase, rephrasing, cantonese, mandarin, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>429 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007505">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007505">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
