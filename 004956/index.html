The present article focuses on the investigation of the deliberate realizations of promotional purposes on the part of three travel agencies on Instagram, by mainly focusing on the combined use of text, layout and imagery. Drawing upon theories such as Visual Design, Systemic Functional Linguistics and tourism discourse, a new framework of analysis was developed in order to provide interesting qualitative insights into three posts shared by three travel companies, based in three different English-speaking countries. The results showed that both the pictures and the texts, along with the layout of the Instagram profile pages and posts, were designed in order to transfer positive attitudes of the destination to the target audience. This function was fulfilled through bimodal and parallel illocutionary acts of persuasion with the purpose of prompting imagination, therefore allowing the consumption of the intangible service and subsequently inducing unconscious needs, positive attitudes and, finally, influencing the behavior of the potential consumer. Hence, this study can supply both actors of the communicational act – sender and receiver – with a critical descriptive outline of promotional narrative patterns. To better understand the implications of these results, however, future research should include the collection of a higher amount of data and the implementation of scientific results, achievable by means of Multimodal Corpus Analysis and further marketing inquiry.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004956/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004956<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>multimodality; systemic functional linguistics; tourism discourse; social media language; online language; instagram; social media marketing, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004956/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>555 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004956">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004956">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
