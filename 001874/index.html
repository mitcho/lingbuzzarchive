Wolof exhibits three different A'-extraction effects: morphological marking of the cyclicity of movement, agreement in class between the wh-complementizer and the extracted phrase, and a subject/non-subject asymmetry, akin to the that-trace effect. The analysis developed here aims to show that agreement lies at the center of all A′-extraction effects, and that their surface morpho-syntactic properties can at least partly be understood as resulting from the general mechanisms underlying the operation Agree, such as the presence of particular uninterpretable features and their location. Wolof is particularly suitable for the exploration of not only the morpho-synatax of A'-movement, but also the interaction of various A'-extraction effects. All the aforementioned effects in Wolof surface on C, and their interaction triggers allomorphy of the complementizer. The novelty of the approach advocated in this paper is in maintaining a unified syntax for different types of A′-movement structures, and providing a realizational analysis in the framework of Distributed Morphology, which attributes the surface differences in the CP layer in Wolof to post-syntactic conditions on feature co-occurrence, known to exist in many languages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001874/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001874<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Natural Language and Linguistic Theory; March 2016, Online First</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>wh-movement; wh-morphology; cyclicity; locality; complementizer agreement; subject/non-subject asymmetry; wolof; feature co-occurrence; complementizer allomorphy, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001874/v6.pdf">v6 [December 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001874/v5.pdf">v5 [December 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001874/v4.pdf">v4 [April 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001874/v3.pdf">v3 [August 2013]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001874/v2.pdf">v2 [August 2013]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001874/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2013]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3871 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001874">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001874">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
