Instead, we uniformly analyze them as regular active sentences where the subject agreeing with T is SE itself, an argumental clitic pronoun, always human and lexically specified as [person], and lacking number φ features altogether. We show that number agreement in SE-constructions does not behave as a genuine syntactic agreement relation and cannot be used as reliable evidence to determine the subjecthood of the overt argument, which uniformly shows syntactic properties of direct objects. A new agreement asymmetry is revealed between postverbal and preverbal/null arguments which conceals two different postsyntactic processes with very distinctive properties: morphological Mutation of an object clitic into number agreement in a CLLD-like configuration, similar to other crosslinguistically attested agreement displacement processes; and Number Harmony  of T with a close DP, a phenomenon not ruled by systematic syntactic or morphological conditions that we link to  similar agreement patterns in other contexts. Strong evidence for Clitic Mutation comes from Clitic Climbing contexts and from idiomatic expressions containing clitics.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005144/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005144<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Prepublication version.
