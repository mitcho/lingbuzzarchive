I approach lifting as a system of generating complex meaning-form correspondences from regularized elements and describe the levels of mental representations and relationships between them that are involved in full command of this system. To be able to do so, I adopt a goal-based conception of meaning, which allows us to talk about mappings from complex goals to complex surface outputs in systems of intentional action, signaling and non-signaling, interactive and non-interactive, in a unified way, and show how it applies in lifting. I then proceed to argue that the grammar of lifting is architecturally very similar to that of language. First, I show that both involve stable (idiomatized/lexicalized) pairings of regularized forms with regularized meanings. Second, I argue that in both lifting and language, meaning-form mapping is mediated by syntax, which, crucially, operates on non-linearized hierarchical structures of abstract objects that include both content morphemes and functional morphemes. I conclude, following and expanding on some insights from prior literature and offering further evidence for them, that neither of these architectural phenomena (idiomatized meaning-form pairings and abstract syntax) is specific to language, with both of them likely emerging in skilled action that does not necessarily involve social interaction, due to considerations of repeatability and reusability of elements in new contexts.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005908/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005908<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Accepted for publication in the Special Issue 'Super Linguistics' of 'Linguistics and Philosophy'</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>super-linguistics, architecture of grammar, meaning and form in non-linguistic systems, semantics, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005908/v2.pdf">v2 [December 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005908/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1165 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005908">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005908">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
