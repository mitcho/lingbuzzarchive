We developed a novel preferential looking study to determine when children learn this, with a focus on the second year of life. Participants watch a video of two puppets. One lacks relevant information while the other has it. At test, the puppets face one another, and participants hear either a series of declarative-assertions or interrogative-questions. The puppets mouths don't move, so participants need to determine who is speaking based on context. We infer who participants believe to be speaking from which puppet they look at. If children understand the links between clause types and speech acts, they should look at the uninformed puppet more during interrogatives, and the informed puppet more during declaratives. Our results demonstrate an effect in the expected direction for 18-month-olds.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007114/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007114<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>BUCLD proceedings</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>acquisition, clause types, speech acts, preferential looking, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>401 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007114">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007114">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
