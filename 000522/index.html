sociolinguistics within the theoretical framework of Distributed

Morphology. We argue that leveling variation, or non-categorical

paradigm syncretism, is well modeled as the variable application of post-syntactic phi-feature deleting Impoverishment operations. We claim,

moreover, that certain morphosyntactic features and combinations are

inherently marked, and that this markedness is what triggers

Impoverishment rules in the morphology, resulting in variable

syncretism. The main substance of our paper consists of three case

studies, wherein we show that the markedness of a particular

morphosyntactic feature causes variable Impoverishment rules to apply,

yielding the observed patterns of syncretism. First, in Monmouthshire,

Wales, the marked feature [+Author] is responsible for variable leveling

to the plural form 'be' in the 1st person, as in 'I be (am) proud of myself'.

Second, in Buckie, Scotland, the marked feature [+Participant] causes a

split pattern of variable leveling to the singular form 'was' in the 1st

person, as in 'We was (were) laughing at each other', but not in the 3rd

person, as in 'They were (*was) laughing at each other'. Third, in Smith

Island, Maryland, the marked feature [+Negation] results in variable

leveling to the plural form 'werent', as in 'She werent (wasnt) scared', as

well as leveling to the form 'aint' across the entire agreement paradigms

of present tense 'be' and 'have'.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000522/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000522<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Formal Approaches to Variation in Syntax</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>morphosyntactic variation, agreement, markedness, sociolinguistic variation, variable rules, impoverishment theory, buckie, smith island, monmouthshire, english dialects, variable rules, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000522/v2.pdf">v2 [October 2007]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000522/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2007]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1347 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000522">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000522">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
