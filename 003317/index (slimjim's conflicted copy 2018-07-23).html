It is claimed that the naming (not describing) of an entity type is what makes a noun a noun (formally, what turns a root into a noun). An ‘entity type’ is understood as an e-type element in the speaker’s ontology, not yet determined as denoting over kinds or their object instances. Higher projections turn this into a predicate, and further grammatical specifications may restrict its reference to what is modelled as elements of a partition, or as atoms, but without a single countability switch. Whether the reference is to kinds or to instances depends on all the specifications that jointly define a division of reference. In particular, plurality enforces an instance reading where the partition it determines is based on spatiotemporally situated parts, in the absence of other criteria for individuality. Beside determining what types of plurals may not license a kind reading, this view of the division of reference analyzes fake mass nouns ('furniture') as a count structure inside a mass shell, which predictively relates their semantics to their morphology. The same analytical framework, with no additional stipulations, explains the properties of non-countable plural nouns, both arising from mass nouns ('waters') and from non-nominal bases ('beginnings'). Finally, a case of mixed-gender DP shows that unexpected interactions between gender and number can be interpreted as cases where the determination of an agreement class is bound up with the determination of part structure. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003317/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003317<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>morphology semantics number plural kinds nouns nominality countability count mass, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003317/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>462 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003317">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003317">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
