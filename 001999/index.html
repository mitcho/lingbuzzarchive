and proposes a solution in terms of rule ordering. The first puzzle is the so-called extraposition paradox where extraposition can target a VP that is part
of a verb cluster only if the VP is topicalized but not when the VP remains
clause-internal. I propose that verb cluster formation takes place at PF under
adjacency and thus after extraposition and topicalization. Extraposition and
topicalization can therefore bleed cluster formation, leading to a crash of the
derivation if the VP remains in-situ. The second puzzle involves the placement
of the infinitival marker te/zu in Dutch and German. I will show that the
cross-linguistic diferences in placement follow from the fact that the rule
that associates the particle with the verb takes place at diferent points of the
PF-derivation in the two languages. While it is an early operation in Dutch and
is still sensitive to hierarchical structure, it is a late process in German and is therefore subject to linear order and adjacency. Both operations interact with other PF rules, and I will demonstrate that it is possible to determine a strict and non-contradictory (and predominantly intrinsic) ordering of the rules which as a side-efect provides evidence for the articulation of the PF-component. Finally, I will show that the zu-placement facts do not provide decisive evidence in favor of either a right-branching or a let-branching VP-structure; rather, the advantages and disadvantages of the two views turn out to largely balance each other out.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001999/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001999<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In Anke Assmann and Fabian Heck 2013 (eds.): Rule Interaction in Grammar.
