Contrary to competition-based approaches to inflectional paradigms, we show that systematic paradigm gaps in these languages are true gaps; the system may or may not be able to generate a certain form, but in neither case is this form considered in comparison to other forms. For Hebrew, we demonstrate that the lack of synthetic non-finite passive forms is not the result of competition with their analytic counterparts. For Latin, we revisit previous analyses of nonactive voice (Embick 2000; Kiparsky 2005) and show that a locality-sensitive, morpheme-based approach (Halle and Marantz 1993) is superior both empirically and conceptually to a theory that generates forms in a putative lexicon and has them compete against each other. Paradigm gaps are thus shown to be better analyzed as the result of syntactic structure building.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002394/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002394<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>morphology, syntax, hebrew, latin, paradigm gaps, nonactive voice, passive</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1499 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002394">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002394">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
