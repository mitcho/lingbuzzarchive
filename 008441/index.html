Currently, many analyses of hyperraising in the literature implicitly or explicitly assume that hyperraising is ruled out by default, but may be facilitated if a given CP is somehow "defective'' or is "deactivated'' as a barrier by some prior operation (Zyman 2024). In this paper, I paint a very different picture in which hyperraising is in principle allowed as long as it obeys the θ-criterion. I focus in particular on a documented connection between indirect perception/evidence predicates and hyperraising in Cantonese and Vietnamese (Lee and Yip 2024), which I argue is best captured in terms of the θ-criterion rather than the phase-deactivation analysis proposed in Lee and Yip (2024). After discussing my new analysis of the Cantonese/Vietnamese facts, I show that this analysis correctly predicts that hyperraising may be allowed even in English as long as the θ-criterion is obeyed. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008441/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008441<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Penn Working Papers in Linguistics 31.1 (PLC48 Proceedings)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>hyperraising, raising, a-movement, evidentiality, perception, theta criterion, argument structure, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/008441/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2024]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>606 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008441">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008441">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
