Although a consensus is emerging that learners solve this problem using both statistical and semantics-based learning procedures (e.g., entrenchment, pre-emption and semantic verb class formation), there currently exist few – if any - proposals for a learning model that combines these mechanisms. The present study used a connectionist model to test an account that argues for competition between constructions based on (a) verb-in construction frequency, (b) relevance of constructions for the speaker’s intended message and (c) fit between the fine-grained semantic properties of individual verbs and individual constructions. The model was able not only (a) to simulate the overall pattern of overgeneralization-then-retreat, but also (b) to use the semantics of novel verbs to predict their argument structure privileges (just as real learners do) and (c) to predict the pattern of by-verb grammaticality judgments observed in adult studies.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002427/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002427<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>connectionist model; verb argument structure; retreat from overgenearlization, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002427/v1.file">v1 [March 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2216 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002427">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002427">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
