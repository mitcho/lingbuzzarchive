It is shown that the variability observed in the real-world distributions that support or fail to support the truth of generic sentences is not arbitrary when we examine the structural and linguistic properties of the scales introduced by their predicates. The analysis is closely guided by work in degree semantics — particularly the notions of scales, comparison classes, and standards of comparison — and analyzes generic sentences as predicating a (non-)gradable property directly of a kind. This contrasts with the dominant approach in the literature that takes them to be tripartite quantificational structures that express relations between sets. The tools that allow the measurement of the degree to which a kind  expresses a (non)-gradable property and its relation to a standard of comparison are drawn from probability theory — cumulative distribution functions and stochastic comparison. On the proposed analysis, any generic sentence As are B may be judged true iff two conditions are satisfied: (a) the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable that gives the value of a random element of A along the scale introduced by B satisfies salience; and (b) the stochastic process associated with the sentence satisfies stationarity.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002364/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002364<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>manuscript; comments welcome</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>generics, gradability, scale structure, comparison class, kind predication, probability, stochastic comparison, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002364/v4.pdf">v4 [January 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002364/v3.pdf">v3 [January 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002364/v2.pdf">v2 [January 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002364/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2583 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002364">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002364">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
