There has been continuing debate about how to treat such phrases syntactically and semantically.  That is, which of the partitive construction's constituents is dominant: the 'part' expression 'two slices' or the 'whole' expression 'cake'?

<br><br>

We propose that the syntactic structures of partitive and non-partitive noun

phrases in Turkish are identical, and that consequently, the dominant constituent for both is the head of the structurally higher NP. For partitives, this higher head of NP corresponds to the 'part' expression.

<br><br>

In Turkish, the NP of both partitives and simple, nonpartitive clauses is the

complement of a functional Case head: K. For all partitives, the part expression serves as the head of this complement NP. Internal to this NP, an NP corresponding to the 'whole' expression is generated and moved to the specifier position of the Case Phrase, or KP, for case licensing.

<br><br>

Evidence is drawn from our fieldwork on specificity, word order, and the

distribution of case in Turkish. Alternative semantic and morphosyntactic theories of incorporation and partitivity are considered but found inconsistent with our data.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000678/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000678<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>partitivity, case, incorporation, specificity, scrambling, turkish, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>473 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000678">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000678">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
