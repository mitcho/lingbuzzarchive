In this article, the results of some questionnaire studies regarding long-distance scrambling in Japanese are presented, and it is argued that they provide some reasons to favor the linearization-based theory over the movement-based theory. The findings presented here indicate that there are at least two distinct kinds of dislocation in natural language syntax and that an analysis in terms of complex domain formation involving partial compaction is an adequate description of one of them.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001271/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001271<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linda Uyechi and Lian Hee Wee, eds., Reality Exploration and Discovery: Pattern Interaction in Language & Life, CSLI, Stanford, 2009, pp. 271-286</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>japanese, long-distance scrambling, linearization, hpsg, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>218 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001271">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001271">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
