The specific goal consists in showing that this hypothesis provides a novel solution to two controversial empirical puzzles: how to derive (i) the low reading of intensional superlatives (e.g. the reading of "the longest book that John said that Tolstoy had written" when John – not the speaker – evaluates the lengths of the books under consideration), and (ii) upstairs de dicto readings (e.g. the reading of "John wants to climb the highest mountain" when John has a specific desire of climbing achievement without any comparative content). In both cases, the superlative clause hypothesis solves previously unsolved problems because it allows split scope between -est and the gradable adjective across the intensional predicate, as well as (variously partial) ellipsis of the degree clause.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007223/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007223<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>superlative; degree clause; comparative; intensionality; ellipsis, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>525 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007223">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007223">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
