Chomsky’s original version of the Binding Theory suggests that anaphors and pronouns are in a complementary distribution. This chapter argues that both anaphoric and coreferential pronominal binding requires licensing at the semantics module. However, the structural underpinning of anaphoric binding is established in narrow syntax, namely, within a phase (cf. Kratzer 2009; Charnavel & Sportiche 2016). Thus, what appears to be a competition between Condition A and Condition B of Chomsky (1986) and following work is a side-effect of derivational timing.

Specifically, I argue that even though a binding relation must be licensed at the semantic module (CI/LF), its structural underpinning is established in narrow syntax. In contrast, a co-referential relation is established only after a phase is labeled by CI (Chomsky 2013; 2015). Following Kučerová (2018), I argue that when CI licenses a phase label, narrow-syntax features projected to the label in narrow syntax get rebundled to become legible to the semantic module (in a parallel to a formation of new feature bundles for the phonology/morphology module, as in the Distributed morphology framework of Halle & Marantz 1993). Whenever the mapping between narrow-syntax bundles and CI-licensed bundles is isomorphic, the narrow syntax representation have a derivational preference. If, however, the interface formation diverts (in a way to be made precise), both anaphors and co-referential pronouns become a plausible morphological output.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004291/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004291<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>biding, derivational timing, syntax-semantics interface, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>46 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004291">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004291">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
