When object marking is symmetric, OMs can refer to both recipients (or benefactives) and themes in ditransitive constructions (although not necessarily both in the same structure). When it is asymmetric, an OM can only refer to the highest object, generally the recipient (or benefactive) in a ditransitive construction.

I propose an analysis of symmetric and asymmetric agreement in the interaction and satisfaction framework. On this approach to Agree, probes have two sets of features. Interaction (INT) features can value a probe, while satisfaction (SAT) features halt probing when a probe encounters them. When a head starts probing, it will continue to do so until it encounters features contained among its SAT features which tell it to stop (or until there are no goals left). This means that a probe can probe or interact with several goals before it is satisfied. I show that the difference between symmetry and asymmetry can be modelled as variation in a probe’s SAT features. A probe that is specified to be satisfied by a feature (e.g. TOP) that only a subset of goals carry will probe until it finds that feature (or runs out of goals).

If in a ditransitive construction the theme but not the recipient carries the relevant feature, the probe will be able to interact with the theme, even if it is less local to the probe than the recipient. In contrast, a probe that is specified to be satisfied by a feature that all goals carry (e.g. φ) will never be able to probe past the first goal it interacts with. This distinction corresponds to symmetry and asymmetry: in symmetric systems, the probe is satisfied by a feature only available on a proper subset of goals. In asymmetric systems, the probe is satisfied by any goal it encounters. Thus in symmetric systems a probe can look beyond the most local argument while this option is ruled out in asymmetric systems.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007642/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007642<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Proceedings of NELS 53</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>object agreement, ditransitives, information structure, locality, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>309 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007642">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007642">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
