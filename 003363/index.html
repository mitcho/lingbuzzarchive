Essentially, "almost" can hold if the proposition follows from the normal outcomes of adding a small number of premises to a selection of relevant facts.  The counterfactual behaves like an ordinary one in several ways, but differs from it in ways that are predictable from its lexical entry.  The counterfactual's ability to save "almost"-at-a-distance is blocked when the temporal properties of the modal anchor and Davidsonian event prevent normal outcomes from coming true when they need to.  Also, non-propositional complements of "almost" block "almost"-at-a-distance by restricting the same temporal properties and preventing normal outcomes from coming true when they need to. 
 
 This approach to "almost" differs sharply from the two general approaches that have emerged in the literature, by replacing the negative polar condition (not p) with a positive `antecedent condition' that entails not p while avoiding the numerous well-documented complications of employing a polar condition.  This approach also highlights the important role played by ordering sources based on normal outcomes in counterfactuality and in weak necessity modals, and suggests that the bridge between the two is the ordering source.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003363/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003363<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>almost, proximity, counterfactuals, modality, variable force, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003363/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2017]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>325 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003363">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003363">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
