Recently, they have been co-opted by theoretical linguists to test hypotheses about how properties of human cognition shape natural language phonology, morphology, and syntax. Empirical evidence derived from these methods has been used to build more precise accounts of the link between how languages are learned (and processed) and cross-linguistic tendencies long-noted in the typological record. This chapter explains why artificial language learning is an important tool in the syntactician’s toolbox, what phenomena it has been used to study to date, and where research with these methods is heading in the future.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006100/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006100<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Oxford Handbook of Experimental Syntax (to appear)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>artificial language learning, syntax, psycholinguistics, typology, language acquisition, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>273 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006100">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006100">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
