I  show that Wolof clitics follow the highest head in the extended projection of the verb, as argued in Dunigan 1994, and that their placement is purely syntactic. The main argument for the absence of any kind of a post-syntactic component that readjusts the position of clitics comes from the behavior of the subject clitic, which can be initial in the extended projection of the verb if there is no higher functional head that could attract it, but patterns with other clitics when such a head is present. I additionally argue that clitics in Wolof do not move to specialized positions for licensing purposes; their movement is triggered by an EDGE-feature on the highest head in the domain so that the goal feature on the clitics becomes activated in the c-command domain of the EDGE-feature, and stays inactive otherwise. This allows the subject clitic to be unaffected by Clitic Movement if it is in the highest position in the extended projection of the verb. Finally, following previous work (Martinović 2015, 2020), I propose that the EDGE-feature can become associated with any head, because the extended projection of the verb is generated as a bundle of features, unfolding to the extent that is required by the nature of the features involved. The EDGE-feature ends up being associated with the highest head automatically through the unfolding process. 

Wolof clitics confirm an important property of Wackernagel-like clitics: that their movement is primarily syntactic, as argued by Ouhalla (1989) for Berber and Franks (1998/2010) for BCS. And while final clitic placement in languages such as BCS does appear to involve postsyntactic readjustment, Clitic Movement of this type looks similar to other types of movement to the edges of domains. To the extent that such movements are syntactically motivated, so then is the movement of Wolof-type clitics. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005363/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005363<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>clitics, wolof, infinitives, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>289 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005363">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005363">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
