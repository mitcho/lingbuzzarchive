within many languages is determined by the type of verb that they are
coupled with. Specifically, he has claimed that reflexives which occur with
‘‘introverted’’ verbs denoting ‘‘actions which one generally performs upon
one’s self ’’ tend to be phonologically lighter than reflexives which occur
with ‘‘extroverted’’ verbs denoting ‘‘actions which the subject usually performs
towards others.’’ Contra Haiman, Kemmer (1993) has argued that
light and heavy reflexive marking is determined by the degree to which
the participants in the action denoted by a sentence are distinguishable.
The current article defends Haiman against Kemmer’s critique but also
advances many other criticisms of Haiman’s analysis. Thus, it is argued
contra Haiman that introversion and extroversion can be properties not
only of the actions denoted by verbs but of the actions denoted by sentences
also. Furthermore, it is shown contra Haiman that notions of introversion
and extroversion can di¤er across languages. Finally, it is demonstrated
that although the distinction between introversion and extroversion can account
for more instances of the contrast between light and heavy reflexive
marking than envisioned by Haiman, it still fails to explain every such instance. Problems with other theories which draw upon the distinction between
introversion and extroversion to motivate the contrast between light
and heavy reflexive marking such as Reinhart and Reuland (1993) are also
highlighted. Finally, it is shown that theories of reflexivization which do not
appeal to the distinction between introversion and extroversion such as
Chomsky (1986) or Pollard and Sag (1992) are unable to predict observed
patterns of light and heavy reflexive marking. It is concluded that no satisfactory account of the contrast between light and heavy reflexive marking
currently exists and that further data pertaining to issues such as diachronic
evolution and cross-linguistic variation is required if such an account is to
emerge.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007237/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007237<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>reflexives, grammar, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>352 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007237">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007237">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
