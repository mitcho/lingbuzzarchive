Instead, it requires recourse to an _operation_ -- one whose invocation is obligatory, but whose successful culmination is not enforced by the grammar.

I then discuss the implications of this conclusion for the analysis of defective intervention by dative nominals. These results lead to a novel view of the interaction of phi-agreement with case, furnishing an argument that both phi-agreement and so-called "morphological case" must be computed within the syntactic component of the grammar.

Finally, I survey other domains where the same _operations_-based logic proves well-suited to model the empirical state of affairs; these include Object Shift, the Definiteness Effect, and long-distance wh-movement.

The thesis examines data from the Kichean languages of the Mayan family (primarily from Kaqchikel), as well as from Basque, Icelandic, and French.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001303/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001303<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>MIT</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agreement, phi-features, operations, mayan, basque, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001303/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2011]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3027 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001303">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001303">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
