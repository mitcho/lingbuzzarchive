Departing from both transformational and earlier lexicalist approaches to nominalizations, I first argue on the basis of English and Finnish evidence that gerunds are not DPs built on heads that embed an extended verbal projection (Baker & Vinokurova 2009, Kornfilt & Whitman 2011), but IPs that need Case. They are categorially verbal at all levels of the syntax, including having structural subjects rather than possessor specifiers. Their nominal behavior is entirely due to the unvalued Case feature borne by their Infl head, which they share with all participial verb forms. I then argue that agent nominalizations are categorially nominal at all levels of the syntax, and that the verb-like case assignment of transitive agent nominalizations is due to the verbal Aspect feature borne by their nominalizing head. Vedic Sanskrit, Northern Paiute, and Sakha evidence is shown to favor this analysis over B&V’s analysis of intransitive agent nominalizations as nominal equivalents of Voice heads and of transitive agent nominalizations as nominal equivalents of Aspect heads. The two “mixed” categories –-- gerunds and transitive nominalizations –-- thus prove to be formally duals in that they are respectively verbs with Case and nouns with Aspect.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003355/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003355<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>event nominalizations, agent nominalizations, lexicalism, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>432 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003355">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003355">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
