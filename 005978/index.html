explain a range of data by positing covert operators at logical form.
For instance, many contemporary semanticists argue that the best way
to capture scalar implicatures is through the use of such operators.
We take inspiration from this literature by developing a novel operator
that can account for a wide range of linguistic effects that until now
have not received a uniform treatment. We focus on what we call
redundancy effects which occur when attitude verbs and modals imply
that certain bodies of information are unsettled about various claims.
We explain three pieces of data, among others: diversity inferences,
ignorance inferences, and free choice inferences. Our account yields an
elegant model of redundancy effects, and has the potential to explain
a wide range of puzzles and problems in philosophical semantics.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005978/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005978<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>redundancy, modals, attitudes, free choice, ignorance inferences, covert operators, exhaustification, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>503 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005978">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005978">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
