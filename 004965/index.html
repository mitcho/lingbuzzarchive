The essential difference is the syntactic difference between a semantically empty subject argument on the one hand and an expletive item of an obligatory subject position. The primary source of evidence will be the passive and the middle construction of intransitive verbs in Germanic and Romance languages. The Germanic group comprises OV and VO languages. The clause structure of the Romance languages is [S[VO]] but they differ with respect to the null-subject property. In all, this cross-linguistic constellation is a good testing ground for theoretical assumptions concerning the syntactic management of subject positions, given the following reference points:

In [S[VO]] languages, the obligatory preverbal subject position is the grammatical source of subject expletives. In the SOV clause structure, arguably, there is no obligatory subject position and therefore no room for expletive subjects. [S[VO]] and VSO languages allow for genuinely subjectless clauses, for structural reasons; the [S[VO]] clause structure does not. 
As for expletives, they have to be distinguished from semantically void subject pronouns, even if the same pronoun may be employed for each function. The subjects of intransitive middles, for instance, are non-referential arguments while the subject of an intransitive passive, as in French or in Scandinavian languages, is a (non-argumental) expletive in a structurally obligatory subject position. Semantically void subjects may be lexical or null, depending on the null-subject property of the given language. Expletive subjects must not be null. In the linguistic reality, there is no such thing as an "empty expletive", contrary to assumptions in the literature.

Whenever the qualities mentioned in the title are confounded in analyses or descriptions of so-called impersonal constructions, the theoretical conclusions based on such data become unreliable. Clauses may be subjectless or contain an expletive or a non-referential subject. What they never contain is a 'null expletive subject'. This is – as shall be demonstrated – a grammatical concept without a factual basis and merely betrays a strong but empirically unsubstantiated SVO bias.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004965/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004965<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In Peter Herbeck, Bernhard Pöll, and Anne C.
