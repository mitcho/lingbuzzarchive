I propose that genitive possessors yield a relation of control co-temporary with the time of the existential predicate, while possessive morphemes introduce a salient relation, possibly different from that of control and holding in all the ongoing situations involving the possessor. I argued that the genitive phrase assumes either the semantics of a relation or, if one of the arguments is universally closed, of a property to be a controller in a given situation. This flexibility allows it to provide a domain restriction in existential possessive constructions and a property in the predicative possessive constructions.
I also propose a fully compositional account of the contrast in the Definiteness Effect between existential possessive constructions on the one hand and predicative possessive constructions on the other. I show that in the latter case an existential presupposition trigger contributes to the sentence presupposition being equivalent or stronger than the assertion, leading to a permanent conflict between presupposition satisfaction and informativeness.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006733/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006733<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Approaches to Predicative Possession (Bloomsbury)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>existential possession, possessive markers, meadow mari, predicative possession, definiteness effect, presupposition, genitive, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>341 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006733">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006733">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
