Clauses like this one show a preposed verb phrase that is headed by a plain verb whereas the non-preposed verb phrase of their canonical counterparts is obligatorily headed by a perfect participle (i.e. 'he has {found / *find} out)'. This peculiarity of verb phrase preposing, which will be referred to as the perfect participle paradox, has seldom been discussed. The paper starts by showing that clauses that manifest the paradox are more frequent in the Corpus of Contemporary American English and in the British National Corpus than their non-paradoxical analogues with preposed canonical perfect participles. The paper then looks at the paradox from the point of view of generative syntax, discusses and rejects previous analyses, and argues that a solution of it entails the rejection of two assumptions that have been associated with a lexicalist position, especially by proponents of distributed morphology. These are the assumptions that a) a syntactic terminal is an item supplied by the lexicon and comprising a phonological representation and b) that syntax may not manipulate the internal structure of syntactic terminals. The paper proposes an analysis that is not based on these assumptions, but argues that the analysis does not entail the superiority of a distributed morphology framework.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002032/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002032<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>English Language and Linguistics  18;3 (2014): 449-470.
