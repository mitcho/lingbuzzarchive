A sentence like <i>If Laura becomes a zombie, she wants you to shoot her</i> asserts that Laura has a certain <i>restricted attitude</i>: her current desires, when considering only possible states of affairs in which she becomes a zombie, are such that you shoot her. This paper seeks to explain the compositional origins of this reading. After arguing against existing theories like Pasternak's (2018) Kratzerian analysis and Blumberg & Holguin's (2019) more indirect pragmatic approach, we provide a novel analysis couched in aboutness. In short, we propose that attitude verbs have four arguments: an experiencer (<i>Who is doing the wanting?</i>), a proposition (<i>What is wanted?</i>), an <i>evaluation argument</i> (<i>Is this an actual or hypothetical desire?</i>), and an <i>aboutness argument</i> (<i>What state of affairs is this desire about?</i>). Structurally, a sentence like the one above simply involves an attitude verb in the consequent of a "regular" bare conditional, with two caveats: the evaluation argument is fixed as the actual state of affairs---these are Laura's actual desires---and the aboutness argument is fixed as the states of affairs quantified over by the conditional (in which Laura becomes a zombie). As a result, the sentence conveys Laura's actual desires about hypothetical zombie states of affairs. We then show two ways in which this broad treatment can generate the desired truth conditions, in which the attitude's world-quantification is appropriately restricted.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005328/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005328<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>accepted with minor revisions, <i>Linguistics and Philosophy</i></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>attitudes, conditionals, disjunction, aboutness, situation semantics, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005328/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1169 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005328">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005328">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
