We discuss several intuitively plausible accounts that attribute these readings to restrictions imposed on the world-quantification of the attitude or some modal operator in its scope. We then provide evidence against these proposals and argue that such "restricted" readings are not a result of any quantificational restriction of this sort. Instead we adopt the view that attitudes are about (possibly non-actual) situations, and illusory restricted readings are a reflection of certain relationships between an attitude-holder and an "about-situation". This new theory accounts for all of the data that were problematic for restriction-based accounts and invites reconsideration of conditionals more generally, on the grounds that other cases of apparent "if"-clause restriction might similarly be reducible to "fake" restricted readings.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005328/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005328<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted for peer review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>attitudes, conditionals, disjunction, situation semantics, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>466 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005328">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005328">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
