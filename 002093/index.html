The reasons for posting the longer version are simple: (1) I said I would in the Frontiers piece, so I probably should; (2) Frontiers charges an unconscionably hefty fee for any paper over 2000 words; (3) I ultimately felt I needed more space for the specific purpose at hand. To this end, I take distinctly non-phlegmatic issue with a recent paper published by Frontiers, Watumull et al.’s On Recursion. This is a paper so riddled with mistakes, misrepresentations, and misinterpretations of the relevant literature that a response was in order. Whether this longer version will be published elsewhere is uncertain, but it clearly offers a better evaluation of what Watumull et al. have done so wrong. Furthermore, it offers a number of additional and related points regarding the place of recursion in linguistic theory, including both its origins and its possible raison d'être.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002093/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002093<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Unsubmitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>recursion; mathematical logic; definition by induction; mathematical induction; computer science; recursive structures., syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2228 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002093">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002093">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
