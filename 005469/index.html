Based on the variable islandhood of these DPs, this paper argues for an agree-based approach to phasehood. Phase opacity is treated as defective intervention, with the phase intervening between the probe and the goal. Defective intervention does not take place if the corresponding phase has independently entered an Agree relation with the movement-triggering probe. Islandhood is thus correctly predicted to be contextually determined: in West Circassian, the difference between clausebound and long-distance possessor extraction is conditioned by the set of agreement features on the local movement-triggering probe: a wh-feature on C in the case of clausebound extraction and a successive-cyclic edge feature on embedded C in the case of long-distance wh-movement. Additionally, the account appeals to the opacity of phase edges to explain the contrast between DPs which display islandhood effects (ergative and applied argument DPs) and constituents which are uniformly transparent for subextraction (the absolutive DP and postpositional phrases).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005469/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005469<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Syntax</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phase theory, wh-movement, ced, pic, agree, intervention, west circassian, adyghe, possessor extraction, dynamic phasehood, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005469/v3.pdf">v3 [April 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005469/v2.pdf">v2 [August 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005469/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1284 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005469">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005469">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
