In West Circassian, ergative and applied arguments are islands for subextraction, while the absolutive argument is not. Counter to previous approaches, the observed asymmetry does not correlate with movement, phi-agreement, position of merge, or structural complexity. Furthermore, these islandhood effects are absent in long-distance wh-movement and parasitic gap configurations. I argue that these patterns arise as a result of phase edges being opaque for subextraction and phases serving as interveners for agree. The contrast between matrix and embedded contexts is reduced to the difference in the featural content of the probe which drives the wh-movement â€“ in embedded contexts this probe successfully agrees with the lower phase heads, rendering them non-interveners for further syntactic operations. The proposed analysis informs our understanding of phasehood, wh-movement, and islandhood effects cross-linguistically. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005469/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005469<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phase theory, wh-movement, ced, pic, agree, intervention, west circassian, adyghe, possessor extraction, dynamic phasehood, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>120 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005469">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005469">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
