For example, English complementizer 'that' and causal 'for' often introduce clauses whose information content is in the Common Ground (as opposed to unmarked zero and 'because', respectively). This article shows that the notion of Common Ground can be usefully applied to the highly polysemous Biblical Hebrew clausal connective ‫י‬‫͏כּ‬ִ /kī/ as well. In particular, I describe three types of reference to the Common Ground: (a) simple reference to discourse-old information, (b) accommodated reference to discourse-new but expected information, and (c) imposed reference where discourse-new information is presented as part of the Common Ground for discursive effect. The many different uses of /kī/ (introducing object and subject clauses as well as causal, temporal, conditional, adversative, concessive, and resultative adverbials) can then be derived from contextual clues given the general function of marking Common Ground. Furthermore, I argue that this function of /kī/ is related to its origin as a [+distal] deictic lexeme, much like English 'that'. The analysis thus adds to a growing body of evidence for the possibility of employing referential features in the left periphery to express relations between interlocutors on the one hand and information content on the other.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007711/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007711<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>complementizers; information status; common ground; [+distal]; biblical hebrew, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>235 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007711">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007711">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
