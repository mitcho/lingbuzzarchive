When such systematic sound-meaning relationships appear to be modulated by iconicity, we refer to these relationships as "sound symbolism,'' although defining precisely what it means for a sound to be iconic of its meaning can be difficult. Nevertheless, in many cases, systematic associations between particular meanings and particular sounds seem to make phonetic sense, i.e., sound symbolic meanings appear to have their roots in the articulatory and/or acoustic properties of sounds under question. This paper reviews these sound symbolic patterns together with their phonetic underpinnings, both in terms of their articulatory and acoustic characteristics. While the aim of this review is not to establish a new theory of sound symbolism, two conclusions nevertheless emerge from the survey: (1) phonetic and phonological considerations do seem to offer insights into the patterning of systematic sound-meaning correspondences that are recurrently found in natural languages and (2) we need to take both articulatory and acoustics factors into account when we consider the phonetic bases of sound symbolism. It is hoped that this review can serve as a useful guide for all researchers who work on sound symbolism.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006053/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006053<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonetics, sound symbolism, frequency code, articulation, acoustics, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>233 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006053">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006053">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
