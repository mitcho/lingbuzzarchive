This is only one of the topics covered by the authors, but the one that will be on readers’ mind throughout the six chapters and three appendices. We have an example here of a study written mainly for educators and parents centered on applications for the classroom. It will also be of interest to researchers, both in the applied (to learning) fields and for scientists working in basic research. The book is centered around a strong proposal for re-orienting educational practice. At the same time, it indirectly calls attention to important theoretical questions, reason for which this review was submitted to a linguistics preprint server. Readers may wonder, given the current climate, whether or not Schatt & Ryan’s practical proposal for teaching is viable; and in fact, in this discussion we will set it aside, as a question for another occasion.   <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006134/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006134<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>conceptual structure, narrative cognition, metacognition, morphology of the folktale, discourse ability, literacy, theory of mind, metalinguistic awareness, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006134/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>308 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006134">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006134">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
