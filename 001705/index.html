In the model, phonological representations embrace phonetic detail, with phonetic parameters represented as activation fields that evolve over time and determine the specific parameter settings of a planned utterance. Existing models of speech production assign little or no role to phonological features, and theories of phonological features lack the notion of the timecourse of how those features get set. One benefit of the model presented here is that it provides a formal link between speech perception and production, which has been notably missing in the literature despite a longstanding debate on the topic (cf. Diehl, Lotto, & Holt, 2004). This dissertation capitalizes on the convergence of novel experimental and computational results to identify specific requirements of any model of the perception-production link, including a role for representations at the level of phonological features and the computational principles of both excitation and inhibition.
  Another benefit of this dynamical model is that it enables establishing formal links between phonological processes and response time data. The model accounts for response times in a task in which speakers hear distractors as they are preparing to produce utterances. Previous studies using this task (e.g., Galantucci, Fowler, & Goldstein 2009) have found that subjects produce an utterance more quickly when they perceive a distractor that is identical to a response being planned than when it is different. The perception-production link is modeled here as the influence of a perceived distractor on the process of setting the phonological production parameters of a required utterance. Response time modulations are due to the effects of combining (in)compatible inputs to this planning process. The model predicts gradient effects on response times based on the degree of similarity between a distractor and a response, with responses being quickest when they are identical, slower when they differ on one parameter (voicing or articulator), and slower still when they differ on more than one parameter. These predictions are confirmed in two experiments that provide the first clear evidence of perceptuo-motor effects of voicing and articulator.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001705/current.pdf?_s=jJBKJAm_ZpgZavrb">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001705<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001705">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001705</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>New York University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonological planning, perceptuo-motor effects, dynamical computational modeling, response times, phoneme classification, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001705/v1.pdf?_s=n9rXLGX-u4QAt6V0">v1 [January 2013]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>332 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001705?_s=rN3DGNbFb9Ad_35F&amp;_k=4RyfttomzUcZNBmG&amp;2">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001705?_s=rN3DGNbFb9Ad_35F&amp;_k=4RyfttomzUcZNBmG&amp;3">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
