Two cases of span-conditioned stem allomorphy</a></b></font><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002284">Jason Merchant</a><br/>November 2014</center>&nbsp;<p></p>The conditions on allomorphic variation, including suppletion, play a central role in debates about the nature of the interaction between phonology and morphology and between theories that are localist versus those that are globalist. One of the central arguments for one version of a localist architecture comes from a putative generalization that selection of allomorphs is strictly local, a claim I will call the Node Adjacency Hypothesis: in particular, that the appearance of a particular outward-sensitive allomorph μ can be conditioned only by morphosyntactic features of an element that is linearly adjacent to μ. In this paper, I present two cases of outward-sensitive allomorph selection that require access to morphosyntactic features of nodes that are not adjacent to the allomorph, from Greek and from English, and show that an alternative generalization using the notion of spanning, the Span Adjacency Hypothesis, can capture these cases without permitting a range of unattested allomorphic variation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002284/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002284<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Inquiry</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>allomorphy, stem, suppletion, greek, english, negation, aspect, voice, tense, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>647 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002284">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002284">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
