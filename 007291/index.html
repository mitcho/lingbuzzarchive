Hence, derivational affixes by hypothesis may comprise both formal and purely semantic features; semantic features by definition having no impact on grammatical representation and not interacting with grammatical operations. The presupposition here is that semantic features are relevant only at the Conceptual-Intentional Interface, they matter for interpretation only. In this respect, semantic features would be relevant for “whatever distinguishes camels from reindeer or a joke from an insult”, as Adger and Svenonius (2011) put it.

Although doing lexical semantics in terms of decomposing denotation into semantic features was discredited and discarded around half a century ago, positing semantic features in order to capture the rich content of derivational morphemes analytically persists. For instance, the Portuguese suffix -eiro ‘tree’ (as in pinheiro ‘pine tree’) would typically be posited to bear a semantic [tree] feature. Clearly, such a feature is not formal, as it would not trigger any grammatical operation, not even agreement. 

This chapter builds a systematic argument against the existence of semantic features, although these would in principle conform with the understanding of features in Chomsky (1995) as instructions to the interfaces, to the Conceptual-Intentional Interface in this case. I first lay out their superfluous character as well as their redundancy in non-lexicalist — and separationist / realisational models of grammar, more generally – models of grammar. Given that lexical meaning in natural language is mediated by grammatical structure containing roots, (purely) semantic features would inevitably be restricted to “non-lexical” elements only, i.e. derivational affixes, that encode rich conceptual content. This makes the positing of semantic features methodologically suspect and, ultimately, redundant.

Accordingly, the rich content of derivational affixes, which can involve pretty much any nominal concept (as in Acquaviva 2009) from ‘profession’, ’tree’ to body parts, will be argued not to be encoded in terms of semantic features. On the contrary, the chapter makes the case for derivational affixes not belonging to a unitary syntactic category, with some derivational affixes actually being roots interpreted in particular structural contexts, as has been argued already since De Belder (2011). The chapter closes by offering a taxonomy of the elements that grammar manipulates.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007291/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007291<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>unpublished ms.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantic feature, formal feature, suffix, root, gender, turkish, portuguese, greek, bella coola, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>246 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007291">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007291">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
