I first lay out their superfluous character as well as their redundancy in separationist / realisational approaches, and in non-lexicalist models of grammar, more generally. Under the assumption that lexical meaning in natural language is mediated by grammatical structure containing roots, (purely) semantic features would inevitably be restricted to “non-lexical” elements only, i.e. those derivational affixes that encode rich conceptual content. This makes the positing of semantic features methodologically suspect and, ultimately, redundant.

Accordingly, the rich content of derivational affixes, which can involve pretty much any nominal concept (as in Acquaviva 2009) from ‘profession’, ’tree’, and ‘place’ to body parts, will be argued not to be encoded in terms of semantic features. On the contrary, this paper makes the case for derivational affixes not belonging to a unitary syntactic category, with some derivational affixes actually being roots interpreted in particular structural contexts, as has been argued already since De Belder (2011). The chapter closes by offering a taxonomy of the elements that grammar manipulates and sketches the division of labour between root structures and formal features.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007291/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007291<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Panagiotidis, P., (2024) “Against semantic features: the view from derivational affixes”, Glossa: a journal of general linguistics 9(1). doi: https://doi.org/10.16995/glossa.10876</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantic feature, formal feature, suffix, root, gender, turkish, portuguese, greek, bella coola, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007291/v2.pdf">v2 [February 2024]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/007291/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2023]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>688 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007291">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007291">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
