This case alternation has been accounted for by resorting to the notion of direct vs. indirect causation. Under this account, the accusative clitic with a transitive verb denotes direct causation while the dative clitic with an intransitive verb expresses indirect causation. The problem with this account is that we lack an independent definition of (in)direct causation in this context and so this approach suffers from circularity: the case of the clitic is used to determine causation type and causation type implies use of one or the other grammatical case. Therefore, a more objective way to account for clitic case alternation is needed. In this paper, I offer one possible solution in this direction by investigating clitic case alternation against Hopper and Thompson’s Transitivity parameters and a small number of other linguistic variables. The analysis is conducted on a dataset of 4,589 sentences analysed with Bayesian mixed-effects models and a large random forest. The results indicate that the transitivity of the infinitive verb, the animacy of the object and the agentivity of the subject are strong predictors of clitic case but there are also important dialectal differences. The findings in this paper allow us to arrive at a finer-grained characterization of the contexts in which each case is more likely to occur and provide further evidence of the pervasiveness of Transitivity in natural language. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005309/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005309<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>spanish, language variation, clitics, bayesian mixed-effects, transitivity, causatives, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>295 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005309">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005309">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
