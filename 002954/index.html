A raised category must stop in the position where it completes the valuation of all of its own unvalued features, which corresponds to the Criterial Position. In the Halting Problem, a wh-object agrees with the embedded C that has Q and is frozen in that Spec. In the Empty Category Principle, a wh-subject should in principle move across a declarative complementizer, since Agree does not occur between the wh-subject and the embedded C that does not have Q. The violation of the Empty Category Principle is not idiosyncratic any longer, with the that-trace effect attributed to the matter of phonology. In the Extended Projection Principle, a subject must move to [Spec,TP] to value its own unvalued Case feature, since the latter cannot be valued by v*. With the subject located in [Spec,TP] both in English and in Italian, whether an overt subject is required or not is attributed to the requirement from the phonological component. I argue that this unified account derives from one of the corollaries of the derivational system based on Labeling Algorithm: labeling results from feature valuation in crucial cases.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002954/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002954<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>criterial position, labeling algorithm, feature valuation, halting problem, ecp, epp, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>276 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002954">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002954">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
