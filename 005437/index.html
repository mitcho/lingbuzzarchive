morphology of Esahie, an otherwise unexplored cross-border Kwa language. Essentially, it
examines pertinent inflectional and word formation issues in the nominal domain of Esahie
such as noun class system, agreement, syncretism, nominalization, and compounding. The
overall goal of this thesis is to investigate and provide a comprehensive account of the attested
types, structure, formation, and the lexical semantics of nouns and nominalizations in Esahie.
This thesis also seeks to understand what the facts about the structure and formation of nouns
and nominalizations in Esahie reveal about the nature of the interface between morphology,
phonology, syntax, and semantics, and about the architecture of the grammar in general. In
interpreting the Esahie data, we ultimately hope to contribute to current theoretical debates by
presenting empirical arguments in support of an abstractive, rather than a constructive view of
morphology, by arguing that adopting the formalism of Construction Morphology (CxM, see
Booij 2010a-d), as an abstractive model, comes with many advantages. We show that the
formalism espoused in CxM is able to deal adequately with all the inflectional and word
formation issues discussed in this thesis, including the irregular (non-canonical) patterns which
are characterized either by cumulative exponence or extra-compositionality. With regards to
compounding, this study confirms the view (cf. Appah 2013; 2015; Akrofi-Ansah 2012b;
Lawer 2017) that, in Kwa, notwithstanding the word class of the input elements, the output of
a compounding operation is always a nominal. This characterization points to a fascinating
(mutual) interplay between the word-formation phenomena of compounding and
nominalization, since the former operation invariably feeds into the latter. Overall, this thesis
shows that nominalization is a prominent word-formation operation in Kwa grammar. Data
used in this thesis emanates from several fieldtrips carried out in some Esahie speaking
communities in the Western-North region of Ghana, as well as other secondary sources.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005437/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005437<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>esahie, nominal morphology, inflection, nominalization, compounding, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1371 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005437">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005437">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
