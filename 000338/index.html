I propose that the properties determining the temporal location of events at the interface level  i.e., Sequence of Tense  also allow the identification of the antecedent of long distance anaphors. I focus mostly on the so-called blocking effects  namely, the impossibility for a long distance anaphor to extend its binding domain beyond certain elements, such as an indicative verbal form in Italian, or an indexical or context-related item in Chinese. I also consider backward binding phenomena, and show how they might follow from the same generalizations. In order to propose a theoretical account of these facts, I investigate the role of the speaker and the bearer of attitude in the sentence. I argue, capitalizing on the proposals by Giorgi and Pianesi (1997, 2001a, 2003, 2004) on Sequence of Tense, that they are syntactically realized and might act as binders and blockers both for temporal purposes and for binding ones.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000338/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000338<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>preliminary version Venice, Italy (to appear in NLLT)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>anaphors, binding, temporal anchoring, de se, indexicality, reflexives, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>84 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000338">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000338">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
