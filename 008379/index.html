Sichel and Toosarvandani (to appear) show that Southeastern Sierra Zapotec (henceforth, ’SSZ’) displays a novel PCC-like pattern: object clitics of all persons are banned when the subject is a lexical DP. This is framed as a Lexical DP Blocking effect (LDB): the subject DP intervenes between a higher Agreeing probe and the object pronoun, preventing it from cliticizing. This paper offers an alternative account, based on new evidence from San Juan Piñas Mixtec (SJPM), related to SSZ. This alternative utilizes the opposite logic: an object pronoun may prevent a low probe from cyclically expanding to Agree with a lexical DP subject. This, in turn, is related to the verb-initial syntax of these languages: a single VoiceP-internal probe is responsible for both PCC effects and subject licensing, as other heads canonically implicated in licensing (e.g., T) are inactive or solely responsible for verb-raising. The highly specific syntax invoked in this analysis may also explain the rarity of the LDB cross-linguistically, while also providing an analytical blueprint for investigating the LDB in related Eastern Otomanguean languages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008379/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008379<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pcc, person-case constraint, clitics, licensing, verb-initial word order, otomanguean, mixtec, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/008379/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2024]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>122 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008379">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008379">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
