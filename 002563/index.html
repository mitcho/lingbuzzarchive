counterpart. In simple cases, an antecedent is associated
with a locus in signing space, and an
anaphoric link is obtained by p
ointing towards that locus to recover its semantic value. It has been
argued that this mechanism is
an overt realization of the device of coindexation in formal syntax
and semantics. Summarizing some of our recent work, we discuss two kinds of insights that sign language research can for this reason bring to the foundations of anaphora. First, in some cases
the overt nature of indices in sign language makes it possible to bring overt evidence to bear on classic debates in semantics. We consider two: the first concerns the availability of situation- denoting variables in natural language (we argue that pointing signs can be situation-denoting in addition to being object-denoting); the other concerns the availability of binding without c- command (we suggest that sign language provides overt evidence for such a possibility). Second, in some cases sign language pronouns raise new challenges for formal semantics. We argue that the iconic component of sign language loci is a case in point; in the end, we suggest that loci may be simultaneously formal variables and simplified depictions of what they denote – which
requires the construction of a formal semantics with iconicity to analyze their properties.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002563/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002563<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the International Congress of Linguistics, Geneva, 2013</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantics, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>451 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002563">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002563">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
