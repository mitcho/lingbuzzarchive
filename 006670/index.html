There have been many proposals regarding how elements get to be unpronounced. This dissertation argues that ellipsis phenomena in Japanese are uniformly generated by a single operation, PF-deletion. In particular, I propose a movement approach to ellipsis in Japanese, where elements to be elided move to the matrix SpecCP in overt syntax and then undergo PF-deletion. The ellipsis phenomena under investigation involve argument ellipsis, V-stranding VP-ellipsis, sluicing, and particle stranding ellipsis. 

I first establish the movement approach to ellipsis with argument ellipsis based on parallelisms between argument ellipsis and overt movement. Specifically, I show that argument ellipsis cannot occur within islands, exhibits signs of successive cyclic movement regarding binding and scope, and induces movement-blocking effects. The movement approach to ellipsis is also shown to favor the PF-deletion over the LF-copy approach to ellipsis, which I further support by showing that extraction is possible out of argument ellipsis sites and that argument ellipsis is sensitive to morpho-syntactic case constraints. 

I also extend the movement approach to ellipsis to V-stranding VP-ellipsis, sluicing, and particle stranding ellipsis, which have been analyzed differently from one another in the literature. In particular, I show that the movement approach to V-stranding VP-ellipsis captures the (im)possibility of null adjunct readings. Additionally, supporting the cleft approach to sluicing, I argue that sluicing is derived by ellipsis of the presuppositional clause of clefts that first undergoes movement. Furthermore, I show that the movement approach to ellipsis provides a natural account of the strange sentence-initial property of particle stranding ellipsis as well as other properties it shares with argument ellipsis. The four ellipsis phenomena (argument ellipsis, V-stranding VP-ellipsis, sluicing, and particle stranding ellipsis) are thus all unified under the movement approach to ellipsis in the sense that they all involve ellipsis that is licensed in the matrix SpecCP. I also suggest a unification between radical pro-drop and ellipsis phenomena discussed in this dissertation, extending the movement approach to ellipsis to radical pro-drop in Japanese, which trivially resolves the long-debated issue of how radical pro-drop is licensed.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006670/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006670<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Connecticut</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>argument ellipsis, v-stranding vp-ellipsis, sluicing, particle stranding ellipsis, radical pro-drop, clefts, scrambling, topicalization, the proper binding condition, ecm, v-movement, the coordinate structure constraint, the case filter, the double-o constraint, case-drop, passives, positive polarity items, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>505 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006670">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006670">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
