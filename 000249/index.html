whether electrophysiological responses to syntactic agreement violations vary as a

function of the type and number of incorrect agreement features. Hindi is well suited to

investigation of this issue, since verbs in Hindi mark agreement with the person, number,

and gender features of the subject noun phrase. Evoked responses were recorded for

visually presented verbs appearing at the end of a sentence-initial adverbial clause,

comparing responses in a grammatically correct condition with four grammatically

incorrect conditions that mismatched the correct agreement on different dimensions

(gender, number, gender+number, person+gender). A P600 response was elicited in all

grammatically incorrect conditions. No amplitude differences were found among the

gender, number, and gender+number conditions. This suggests that the degree of overlap

between observed and expected word forms at the morphosyntactic level does not impact

ERP responses, contrasting with findings at the semantic level (Federmeier & Kutas,

1999) and in auditory processing (Paavilainen et al., 2001). A significantly larger P600

response was elicited in the person+gender condition, an effect that is attributed to the

greater salience of the person feature in multiple levels of representation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000249/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000249<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>event-related potentials, sentence processing, agreement, p600, hindi, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>497 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000249">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000249">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
