Nakanishi’s argument is based on the assumption that even cannot associate with a focus which has moved out of its LF scope. I show that this assumption is incorrect, defusing Nakanishi’s argument.

I propose that when even associates with a focus which has moved out of its surface scope, it actually associates with focused material in the lower copies of movement (trace positions). I show that a closer look at ACD examples of Nakanishi's type in fact forms a new argument against the scope theory. I conclude that English VP-even must always be interpreted in its pronounced position. The patterns of focus association with even presented here constitute a new argument for the copy theory of movement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003132/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003132<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Natural Language Semantics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>even, association with focus, scope theory of even, backwards association, copy theory of movement, antecedent-contained deletion, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003132/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>855 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003132">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003132">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
