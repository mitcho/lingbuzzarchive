However, in colloquial French, ne is variable and only rarely realized (< 10%). While previous research suggests clear constraints on ne-realization in interadult speech, less is known about the nature of ne in the negative utterances of French children and their caregivers. While a few previous studies have investigated ne-retention in child-directed speech specifically, findings have been mixed and reports of ne in children’s own productions are exceptionally rare. In the current study, we contribute to the growing body of work on children’s acquisition of sociolinguistic variation by analyzing patterns of ne-retention in the conversational speech of 14 monolingual French-learning children (ages 0;11-8;01) and their caregivers. We found that, for both French children and their caregivers, ne-retention was rare and followed the same linguistic constraints previously reported for interadult speech. Importantly, our results indicate that children follow these constraints from their earliest ne-attestations — age 2;05 on average — adding further support to the notion that children acquire grammatical constraints on variation from a young age. Further, while our caregivers did not boost their use of ne in child-directed speech, ne-retention in the input influenced children’s acquisition of the variable: caregivers with higher ne-retention rates had children who used more ne and from a younger age.
