This article provides supportive analytic data from Chinese for this observation and offers a feature-centered cartographic account (Rizzi 1997, 2004). In the explanation, first of all, a subjective epistemic modal would occupy the highest syntactic projection and take scope over other scope bearing elements, while an objective epistemic modal is located lower, which is accessible to the scopal interaction. Secondly, an epistemic adverbial, being subjective, would undergo feature movement to the highest position when it was introduced in the lower one initially. This feature movement, however, would be blocked by another feature of the same type of a scope bearing element, given the theory of revised relativized minimality. As a natural consequence, no scope bearing element can have scope above a subjective epistemic modal. Finally, various neglected epistemic interference effects on wh-construals would be brought out, and soon after the explication, we will realize that they are strong arguments in favor of the feature-centered cartographic analysis.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001508/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001508<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to be submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>epistemic containment, epistemic modality, intervention effect, subjectivity, wh-construals, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001508/v2.pdf">v2 [November 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001508/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2012]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>822 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001508">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001508">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
