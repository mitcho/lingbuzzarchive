However, there is some unclarity regarding its scope. For example, does Merge combine the verb with aspect, or is there some other way for such features to be combined? There are combinations of features, such as the first person with the present tense in the English auxiliary <i>am</i>, for which Merge does not seem to be the optimal device. Using the term Merge for all feature combinations may reduce the content of the notion. In this paper, I outline a model for the generation of feature combinations which does not rely on Merge. 

I suggest that the mechanism which creates extended projections and features bundles can be modeled as a finite state network. Transition represents the addition or projection of features, and states represents categories with features. Output states correspond to categories, while non-output states corresond to noncategorial features. 

I accept Chomsky's (1957) arguments that such a system cannot replace Merge, which is necessary for embedding one extended projection inside another, but I suggest that it can account for the construction of extended projections and feature bundles. In this way, Merge can be restricted to those cases where it is truly needed, and can be studied in a sharper light. For example, I suggest that the chronic problem of labeling may be resolved if extended projections are not created by Merge.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001581/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001581<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms. CASTL, University of Tromsø</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>merge, project, bundle, features, categories, projections, finite-state, grammar, syntax, computation, feature geometry, functional sequence, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1057 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001581">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001581">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
