embedded clauses are built compositionally. It provides an argument for the view
that the source of displacement in such sentences is within the embedded clause
(Bogal-Allbritten, 2016; Elliott, 2020; Kratzer, 2006, 2013; Moulton, 2009). The
main evidence comes from comparing clauses that combine with nouns like 'idea'
and clauses that combine with nouns like 'situation' in Russian and Korean.


I argue that the two kinds of embedded clauses are modifiers of nouns and that they have distinct meanings. Taken together, these two properties necessitate
a view that the source of displacement, when it is present, must come from
within the embedded clause. I propose that clauses that combine with nouns like
'idea' contain a syntactic projection in the left periphery, which I call Cont, that introduces displacement. Clauses that combine with nouns like 'situation' lack this projection. I provide morphosyntactic evidence for existence of Cont: I show that in Korean and Buryat we see overt morphology spelling out this syntactic head. Finally, I show that the two kinds of clauses that we see with nouns can also occur with verbs: verbs also can combine with CPs that introduce a shift to other possible situations, as well as with CPs that do not introduce displacement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007469/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007469<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>complementation, attitude reports, intensionality, korean, russian, buryat, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>344 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007469">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007469">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
