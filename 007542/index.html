The procedure, implemented as a working computer program, takes as input an MG lexicon and a sequence of sentences paired with their semantic representation, and outputs an MG lexicon that is a superset of the input lexicon and that yields for each input sentence a syntatic structure encoding the associated semantic representation. The procedure operates by first constructing an SMT model of a language acquisition device that is constrained by the input lexicon and the (sentence, semantic-representation) pairs, and then using an SMT-solver to identify a model-solution in which the lexicon is optimized for parsimony. We show how the procedure can be used to form a computational model of a child language learner, presenting two experiments in which the procedure is used for instantaneous and incremental acquisition of an MG lexicon, and find that the optimal MG lexicons inferred by the procedure yield derivations that agree with the prescriptions of contemporary theories of minimalist syntax.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007542/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007542<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of 16th edition of the International Conference on Grammatical Inference</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>minimalist program, minimalist grammar, automatic theorem proving, language acquisition, satisfiability modulo theories, semantics, syntax, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>178 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007542">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007542">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
