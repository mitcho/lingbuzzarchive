It occurs in small clause complements of stative and dynamic raising verbs and ECM verbs—including nomination verbs. Besides argument small clauses, -gaa always occurs in adjunct small clauses—depictive and resultative secondary predicates. In small clauses of primary predica- tion, -gaa’s adjectival use, it gives a temporary state or stage-level meaning, whereas without it, the meaning is individual-level or per- manent. We analyze this difference with and without -gaa as eventive vs. non-eventive predication, following Higginbotham & Ramchand (1997), Roy (2005), and Adger & Ramchand (2003), with -gaa as the [+eventive] Pred0 of non-verbal predicates, whereas without -gaa, the predicate is [-eventive] Pred0. As for adverbs formed with -gaa, we propose that they have the internal structure of a small clause, with an event-controlled PRO as the implicit argument subject of the small clause, since we know by now that -gaa diagnoses a small clause in the sentence. After all, adverbs are treated in semantics as predicates of the event argument, as a form of non-verbal predication. The manner adverb is similar to the depictive –an adjunct small clause, co-temporal with the event, only it is predicating of the event, via an event controlled PRO. This PredP occurs in the Speci er position of the Asp Phrase (Cinque1999).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003947/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003947<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Analysis</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>predp adverbs small clauses, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>365 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003947">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003947">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
