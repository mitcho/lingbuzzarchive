But regardless, both tend to respect locality and are sensitive to information that is present in the input, not the output. We document a counter-example to these tendencies from Western Armenian, and we discuss how the data falsifies such restrictive models of allomorphy. The Western Armenian theme vowel -i- changes to the theme vowel -e- due to two types of triggers. The first type of trigger is phonological: the change happens when the theme vowel is unstressed in the output. This is a type of allomorphy that is conditioned by output phonology. The second type of trigger is morphological: the change happens when the verb is in the past tense. The +Past morpheme can be either in the verb (adjacent to the theme vowel) or on a separate auxiliary in periphrasis. This amounts to a case of long-distance allomorphy that is conditioned across words, even in suspended affixation. For suspended affixation, I provide semantic and prosodic evidence that suspended affixation is created via base-generation and not via ellipsis. The inability to use ellipsis acts as additional evidence that the allomorphy is long-distance. ******[Title: Output-conditioned and non-local allomorphy in Armenian theme vowels]<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006049/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006049<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in The Linguistic Review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>allomorphy; periphrasis; locality; readjustment; long distance allomorphy; output-sensitive allomorphy; suspended affixation; stress-conditioned allomorphy; word-external allomorphy, morphology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006049/v2.pdf">v2 [April 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006049/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1025 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006049">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006049">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
