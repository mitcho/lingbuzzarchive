Like subject agreement, clitic doubling refers to the ability of an agreement morpheme (in this case, a clitic) to co-occur with an associated DP in an argument position. Similar to what happens with subject agreement, the Spanish Direct Object (DO) and Indirect Object (IO) clitics can co-appear with a wide variety of argumental DPs (pronominal, anaphoric, definite and quantificational DPs). However, unlike subject agreement, which is always mandatory in finite clauses in Spanish, clitic doubling presents a more complex pattern: it can be optional, obligatory or impossible, depending on complex factors concerning the nature of both the doubled DP and the DO/IO clitic itself.

	In minimalism and its predecessors, the study of the syntactic properties characterizing the wide variety of clitic doubling structures existing in Spanish have played a fundamental role in the developing of the two main hypotheses concerning the syntactic status of DO/IO clitics: the agreement vs. the pronominal hypotheses. 

	According to the agreement hypothesis, DO/IO clitics should be analyzed as the morphological reflex of an Agree relation holding between a verbal-like functional head and an argumental DP inside the VP. In contrast, under the pronominal hypothesis, DO/IO clitics are best analyzed as pronominal clitics: i.e., as argumental (DO/IO) pronouns which for independent reasons must undergo syntactic head-movement to a verbal-like functional head. 

	These two hypotheses make opposite predictions regarding the behavior that DO/IO clitics will display at the syntax-semantics interface. 

	The pronominal hypothesis predicts that in Spanish DO/IO clitics will display the hallmarks of (object) pronouns: i.e., like their non-clitic counterparts, pronominal clitics (i) should be ruled by Principle B of the Binding Theory, and (ii) should have the referential/semantic features allowing them to ‘affect’ the semantic interpretation available for the referential DPs that they double. 

	In opposition to the pronominal hypothesis, however, the agreement hypothesis argues that DO/IO clitics should best analyzed as verbal agreement morphemes lacking referential properties. Following this line of reasoning, this hypothesis predicts (i) that the Spanish DO/IO will be invisible to Binding Theory and (ii) that they will not ‘affect’ (or interfere with) the semantic interpretation of the referential DPs that they double (because verbal agreement morphemes lack the referential features necessary to do so). 

	In order to evaluate these two hypotheses, in this thesis I offer the results of comprehensive study of the binding relations that DO/IO clitics can establish with the doubled DP and with different noun phrases in a clause, as well as the structural conditions under which such relations are licensed in this language. In addition to the paradigms already discussed in the literature, I introduce a whole set of new paradigms of clitic doubling in configurations that had never been reported or discussed before, with special attention to the referential interpretations that are available for both DO/IO clitics and doubled DPs in each configuration, a question that had been neglected in most of the works on this topic.

	The study of these properties will prove crucial to evaluate the empirical and theoretical adequacy of previous versions of the agreement and the pronominal hypotheses in accounting for the whole range of syntactic and semantic properties DO/IO clitics display in Spanish. To this end, I will extend Büring’s (2005) analysis of Binding Theory (BT) in English to the analysis of the whole range of clitic doubling configurations existing in Spanish.

	On the basis of this analysis, I will conclude (i) that, unlike alternative competing analyses of BT, Büring’s version of BT (provided with some new theoretical extensions I will introduce and defend) is able to account in principle way for the whole range of binding properties that DO/IO clitics display in Spanish, and (ii) that in Spanish clitics do not form an unitary class; rather, they split into two different subclasses, which I refer to as phi-clitics vs. D-clitics. 

(i) 	The class of phi-clitics is made up of the 1st/2nd person DO/IO clitics me/te/nos/os and the so-called reflexive clitic se. All these clitics display the hallmarks of object agreement: (i) they are invisible to Binding Theory, and (ii) lack the referential/semantic features necessary to affect the semantic interpretation of the argumental DPs that they double. 

(ii)  	On the other hand, the 3rd person DO/IO clitics lo(s)/la(s)/le(s) (which I dub D-clitics) display all the hallmarks of pronominal clitics: (i) they are ruled by Principle B, and (ii) are able to affect the interpretation of the doubled DP. 

	Thus, one of the main theoretical contributions of this thesis is to show that in Spanish the pronominal and agreement hypothesis are both correct, but account for a different group of clitics. The new mixed (or heterogeneous) analysis I will propose of Spanish clitics not only accounts for the binding properties that the different subclasses of clitics display in this language, but also explains why these two different subclasses of clitics are not allowed to doubled the same range of argumental DPs. While phi-clitics are verbal agreement morphemes and do not impose any restriction on the type of argumental DPs that they can double, D-clitics are clitic pronouns and, as such, they are not allowed to double DPs whose binding requirements are in contradiction with the binding requirements or the referential interpretation of the pronominal clitic itself.
