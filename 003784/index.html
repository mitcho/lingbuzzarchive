Henry 1995 reports that a wide range of unaccusative verbs allow for postverbal  subjects in BelfE, but in the ScotE dialect considered here, only a very restricted subset of verbs allow it. The ScotE data cast doubt on Henry 1995's proposal that the licensor of postverbal subjects is weak agreement. I argue that the subjects in these constructions are actually  external arguments of small clauses (of which goal-PPs are taken to be a subset, following e.g. Beck & Snyder 2001). The differences between dialects is located in the structure of resultatives; standard English resultatives are proposed to be interpreted via a rule of semantic composition similar to von Stechow 1995's Principle R, while in BelfE, interpretation is mediated by a [cause] feature, which can assign Case to the small clause's external argument. ScotE is an intermediate case, where only light motion verbs are endowed with Case-assigning [cause]. The paper also discusses a construction in ScotE where 'away' can appear without an overt verb and with a postverbal subject ('away you to bed'), analyzing the structure as containing a null [cause]-marked motion verb.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003784/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003784<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>unaccusatives, imperatives, word order, scottish english, belfast english, microvariation, null motion verbs, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>60 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003784">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003784">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
