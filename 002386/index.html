Viewpoint aspect is a common determiner of such splits: perfective aspect is often associated with ergative alignment, while imperfective is associated with its absence (Moravcsik, 1978; Silverstein, 1976). Recent work has argued that splits arise from properties of the imperfective that disrupt otherwise-available mechanisms of ergative alignment (Laka, 2006; Coon, 2010, 2013a). This paper argues rather that the perfective can be a source of ergative case, and specifically that ergative alignment in Hindi-Urdu arises from the intersection of two different ways of expressing perfective aspect, each attested independently in other languages. The first is the use of oblique case to mark perfect or perfective subjects, and the second is a morphosyntactic sensitivity to transitivity, a hallmark of auxiliary selection in Germanic and Romance languages. The result is a more unified view of the morphosyntax of perfective aspect, though at the cost of a less unified account of aspectually split ergativity.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002386/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002386<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Toronto</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, morphosyntax, ergativity, auxiliary selection, aspect, perfect, perfective, case, oblique subjects, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002386/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1118 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002386">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002386">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
