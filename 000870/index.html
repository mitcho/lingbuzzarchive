It is argued that several properties formerly understood as melodic (the elements H, ? ("stop") and to some extent also A) should rather be replaced by structural configurations. Such a shift from melody towards structure allows for a more successful (and crucially: non-arbitrary) account of the properties associated with those elements. At the same time, it has serious repercussions on the theory of constituent structure (large parts of which need to redone completely) and also the representation of length. As a by-product of those changes clear parallels between the length systems of English and Estonian, usually seen as very different from each other, emerge. The new model presented allows for a nearby unification of those two languages. The behaviour of length is shown to be practically identical in the two languages, both in terms of distribution and alternations. The one area where the two languages do differ is in analytic morphology. Accordingly, an account of the crucial morphological factors is worked out, which also allows for a successful extension of the model to length in Italian. Last but not least, an analysis of cluster phonotactics is presented. It is shown that the new model is not only capable of explaining phonotactic restrictions within clusters, but also allows for deriving the distribution of length within clusters from those same phonotactic principles, thus strengthening the account.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000870/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000870<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Vienna, PhD thesis</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>estonian, english, phonological length, structure, melody, gp 2.0, overlength, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>194 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000870">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000870">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
