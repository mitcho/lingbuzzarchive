The present study investigates individual variation in this active search procedure, leveraging an ongoing change in the pronoun system of North American English. The types of referents compatible with the 'they'-series of pronouns is expanding, with an increasing number of speakers allowing definite singular referents: especially but not exclusively when referring to someone with a nonbinary gender identity. Sociolinguistic work shows that the speakers who most accept innovative usages of singular 'they' tend to be younger, or to be non-cisgender (e.g. transgender, nonbinary). Recruiting participants representing diverse ages and gender identities, the present experiment tracked reading times of sentences involving cataphora. Results shows that cataphoric 'they' is processed differently than cataphoric 's/he', across the board. There is a significant processing cost to reading a plural noun that follows cataphoric 's/he, indicating that singular cataphors evoke strong number-expectations. However, the cost of reading a singular noun after 'they' is smaller and emerges later; 'they' seems to evoke weak number-expectations. Individual differences show that those expectations are especially weak for younger participants, perhaps reflecting a higher baseline familiarity with singular 'they'. On the other hand, course-grained gender identity (cis vs. non-cis) does not seem to be a reliable predictor of how cataphoric 'they' is processed. Integrating insights from sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics, this study offers a novel view into ongoing language change and its manifestation in real-time processing measures.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007848/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007848<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sentence processing, singular they, cataphora, individual differences, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>330 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007848">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007848">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
