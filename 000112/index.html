Schütze</a><br/>July 1994</center>&nbsp;<p></p>I argue for the necessity of Halpern's (1992) proposed operation of Prosodic Inversion (PI), which can re-order a clitic and a potential host word in order to satisfy the clitic's need for a host in a particular direction. In Serbo-Croatian, this will allow enclitics that are clause-initial at S-structure to surface encliticized to the first prosodic word of the clause. Thus, at least some instances of 'second word' placement are not due to the syntax. However, all instances of 'second constituent' placement where the initial constituent is larger than one prosodic word are due to syntactic fronting across the fixed position of the clitics. I suggest that clitics are in Comp1 at S-structure, so that XPs that move to Spec-CP or heads that move to C0 are potential hosts for the clitics, but neither of these movements is obligatory. I propose that the level of Morphological Structure (Halle & Marantz 1993) is where lexical insertion takes place, including insertion of clitics, and that at this point a template based on morpho-syntactic features determines the order among the clitics under C0. At this point, the clitic cluster becomes a morphological constituent, taking on the prosodic subcategorization frame of each of its member elements, i.e. the need for a host word to the left. After morphological operations are complete, the S-structure tree as modified by the morphology is subject to a process of prosodic mapping that derives a hierarchical prosodic structure for the sentence from its syntactic structure; it is the resulting prosodic structure that is subsequently input to the postlexical phonology. I argue that prosodic mapping must crucially happen in two stages, the first a blind application of constituent-forming rules sensitive only to syntactic boundaries, the second a repair phase that modifies the output of the first based on prosodic requirements of the language. I claim that PI is part of this second stage, repairing sentences wherein clitics are unlicensed due to the lack of a host by performing the minimal change needed to license them, namely inverting the linear order of the clitic cluster and the following prosodic word.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000112/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000112<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>MIT Working Papers in Linguistics 21, Papers on phonology and morphology, 1994, pp. 373–473.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dm, morphology, syntax, serbo-croatian, serbian, croatian, bosnian</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1400 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000112">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000112">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
