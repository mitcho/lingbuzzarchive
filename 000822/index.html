These relations are too non-local for the Phase Impenetrability Condition. I argue that the problem lies in the assumption that only labels of syntactic objects are visible for syntactic operations. Therefore, I propose a representational-derivational model that does not make this assumption. Specifically, the whole set information resulting from the operation Set-Merge is visible for syntactic operations. This allows deriving the non-local relations in several local steps. To derive the difference in locality behaviour between the operation Agree and Move, I propose that for the operation Agree, only the set information on the sister syntactic object is relevant and that for the operation Move, also the tree information with the Phase Impenetrability Condition is relevant because it is a composed operation. I also show that c-selection behaves differently from s-selection, Agree and other long-distance relations with respect to the information given by the operation Set-Merge.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000822/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000822<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in A.
