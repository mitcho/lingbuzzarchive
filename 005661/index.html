Based on novel data from original fieldwork, we argue that what has been described as an agreeing ‘say’-based complementizer in Kipsigis (Diercks & Rao 2019, Diercks et al. 2020) is the lexical verb ‘say’, and what looks like C-Agree is in fact agreement between this verb and its locally introduced (often covert) subject. Our analysis highlights that ‘say’-based complementizers might be of category V, and not C, in more languages than previously thought (Koopman 1984, Koopman & Sportiche 1989, Major & Torrence 2020), which means that some instances of what has been described as C-Agree may instantiate standard verbal agreement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005661/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005661<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>`say’-based complementation, complementizer agreement, nilotic, contentful eventualities, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005661/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>640 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005661">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005661">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
