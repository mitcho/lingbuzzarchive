While in the singular they invariably trigger natural (masculine) agreement, alternation between masculine and (grammatical) feminine obtains in the plural. The problem for theories of such nouns comprises two challenges: the Agree mechanism needs to be able to operate on two kinds of gender, and the mechanism needs to allow gender agreement to interact with number. Previous accounts (e.g. Wechsler and Zlatic 2003) propose complex mapping between semantic, syntactic and class features, but ultimately cannot derive the obligatoriness of
natural agreement in the singular and optionality in the plural in a unified way. A Minimalist account of such nouns has not yet been proposed, and the existing accounts of hybrid agreement cannot capture this particular pattern. I provide a Minimalist analysis of hybrid nounsâ€™ agreement combining the formal tools of feature hierarchies and relativised probing, deriving the obligatoriness of natural gender in the singular, and Cyclic Agree, with different orders of application of Agree operations, which derives plural alternations as intervention effects.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002750/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002750<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002750">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002750</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>gender, number, class, feature geometry, relativised probing, order of operations, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>209 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002750">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002750">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
