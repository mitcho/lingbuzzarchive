In Chapter 2, I examine a number of properties of multiplicative complex cardinals like three hundred books. The starting point in the discussion in this chapter is recent work by Ionin and Matushansky (2006, 2018), who argue that in a multiplicative complex cardinal like "three hundred", the multiplier ("three") and the multiplicand ("hundred") have the same syntactic and semantic properties. I point out some problems for Ionin and Matushansky’s (2018) analysis of multiplicative complex cardinals, and argue that multiplicands are syntactic heads used for measurement, whereas multipliers are phrasal constituents appearing in the specifier position of a phrase headed by the multiplicand. Chapter 3 investigates additive complex cardinals like "twenty one books". Ionin and Matushansky (2018) argue that additive complex cardinals generally involve a coordinate structure. In this regard, I argue that there are two types of coordination structure for additive complex cardinals, building on Ionin and Matushansky’s (2018) analysis of additive complex cardinals and the discussion in Chapter 2. I will also show that additive complex cardinals in some languages behave differently depending on the presence/absence of an overt coordinator. All the crosslinguistic data that will be discussed in Chapter 3 can be accounted for by assuming a non-coordinate structure of additive complex cardinals, in addition to the coordinate structure. Chapter 4 investigates the derivational patterns of ordinals like "the seventh book", on the basis of results of a broad cross-linguistic survey. Based on an examination of strategies of forming ordinals in both classifier and non-classifier languages, a common property of ordinals will be identified: ordinals behave like nominal expressions. I also examine possible and impossible constituent orders concerning ordinals, and show that ordinal markers display the same pattern as numeral classifiers regarding (im)possible constituent orders in combination with nouns and numerals. Building on this similarity, I propose that ordinal markers and numeral classifiers occur in the same position in the extended nominal projection. Chapter 5 examines linguistic expressions of fractions like "two thirds of the book". It will be shown that the numerator and the denominator can in"lude a covert/overt “part” noun in fractions on the basis of a cross-linguistic survey. I will show that the existence of the "part" element is not expected under Ionin and Matushansky’s (2018) analysis of fractions and provide an alternative analysis for the syntax and semantics of fractions. Building on the proposed analysis, I will also argue that some languages allow for two types of structures of fractions: the left-branching structure and the cascading structure.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006098/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006098<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD Dissertation, University of Connecticut</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>measure phrases, classifiers, numerals, cardinals, ordinals, fractions, syntax, semantics, morphology, typology, cross-linguistic survey, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>440 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006098">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006098">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
