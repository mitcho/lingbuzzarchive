In this paper I show that these arguments are still as forceful as ever, despite 60 years of developments in stochastic neural net style research and work developing cognitive semantics. I also address the issue of whether work in generative syntax itself, that suggests that the content of functional categories  are co-opted from other systems of thought, threatens the autonomy thesis, and argue that it does not, providing an account of how functional categories are ordered (Extended Projection) that relies on the idea of maximizing the computational simplicity of the syntax-semantics interface. Rather than threatening the autonomy of syntax, grammar focussed investigations of questions of meaning have strengthened and clarified the issue, as well as opening up new research questions, showing just how fertile the core set of ideas, laid down in Syntactic Structures 60 years ago, remain.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003442/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003442<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In Hornstein et al (2018) Syntactic Structures after 60 Years. 153-175</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>cognitive semantics, stochastic effects, neural nets, functional categories, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2652 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003442">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003442">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
