The first is an investigation into the form and determination of minimalist (Chomsky 1995) parameters, whose nature is uncertain compared to the well-defined principles and parameters approach of Chomsky (1981). One prominent approach (termed “lexicocentrism”) confines variation to the features of heads in the lexicon, which, though minimal, places a significant acquisitional burden on the learner, and appears to predict unstructured variation, despite typological and diachronic evidence to the contrary. Roberts & Holmberg (2010), Roberts (2010c, 2012 et seq.) suggest these problems may be resolved if structure is provided by domain-general learning principles, which combine to create emergent hierarchies of microparameters. I develop this suggestion in detail, proposing a domain-general algorithm for categorisation and feature assignment which is applied to a number of toy linguistic examples.

The second strand concentrates on a specific area of syntactic variation: that of focus expression. This area exhibits vast diversity, with structures not only differing significantly across languages, but also within them. Moreover, most previous attempts to describe these differences either fail to account for the full range of variation seen, or rely heavily on the notion of construction. I suggest that two components are necessary to break these constructions down into their constituent heads. Firstly, I take focus to be unified by the invocation of alternatives (Krifka 2007), and building on Rooth’s (1985, 1992, 1996) theory of alternative semantics, I argue that focus constructions may be described as an abstract relation between an expression and its alternatives. Secondly, a null hypothesis of compositionality allows these descriptions to shed light on syntactic structure. This approach is demonstrated for focus constructions in English, Nepali, ASL, LSB, and BSL, and the resulting analyses are shown to be acquirable by the domain-general algorithm, providing a new perspective on parameterisation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003006/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003006<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Cambridge</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>focus, parameters, hierarchies, recos, asl, bsl, lsb, nepali, english, alternative semantics, emphatic focus, focus doubling, contrastive reduplication, syntax, phonology, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>895 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003006">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003006">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
