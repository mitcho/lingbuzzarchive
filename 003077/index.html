Her descriptive generalization is the following:
(1)	a. The overt subjects of control complements can only be pronouns.
	b.  The   overt subjects of raising complements can be pronouns or lexical DPs.
This paper examines European Portuguese (EP) and shows that it complies with (1). It is argued that the explicit subjects that occur in these infinitival complements in EP (as well as in Spanish or Italian) are genuine postverbal subjects of the kind that are attested in a standard consistent null subject language (NSL). These are assumed to be sitting in their first merge position inside v/VP (Costa 1998). We examine generalization (1) in light of the current debate between raising versus non-raising theories of obligatory control (OC) and show that the evidence underlying (1) constitutes a strong case in favor of a non-raising approach. Relying on the observation that all of the Romance NSLs allow for explicit subjects in raising and control complements in compliance with (1), we develop an account that aims to capture the association between this phenomenon and the null subject property.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003077/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003077<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>SANTOS, Ana Lúcia & Anabela GONÇALVES (org.s) [2016].
