been overlooked. This paper presents data on kind questioning constructions in
English, followed by an analysis of these constructions. The Old English what
followed by a partitive genitive noun, labeled the ‘what partitive construction’
(WPC), questions the kind and, unlike in other languages, it also questions the
number of the noun. I analyze the WPC as including an unpronounced noun that
heads the DP, as is evident from the agreement on the verb. In Middle English, an
overt light noun (e.g., kind and number) replaces the WPC which initially functions
as the head of the entire DP but later grammaticalizes into a higher functional
category. There is also a stage with a ‘what for construction’ (WFC) but, unlike in
the history of German, the English WFC appears a few centuries after the loss of the
WPC, seems unrelated to the WPC, and is not long-lived. The analysis of the
English WFC involves a PredP, adapting ideas from earlier proposals. The main
contribution of the paper is to present a new set of data and a synchronic analysis for
them.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006152/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006152<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>JCGL</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dp · grammaticalization · kind · np · number · predp · what for, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>591 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006152">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006152">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
