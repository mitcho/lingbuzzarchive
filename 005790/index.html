To address this problem, simultaneous recordings of three repetitions of the cardinal vowels were made using a Zoom H6 Handy Recorder with external microphone (henceforth H6) and compared with two alternatives accessible to potential participants at home: the Zoom meeting application (henceforth Zoom) and two lossless mobile phone applications (Awesome Voice Recorder, and Recorder; henceforth Phone). F0 was tracked accurately by all devices; however, for formant analysis (F1, F2, F3) Phone performed better than Zoom, i.e. more similarly to H6, though data extraction method (VoiceSauce, Praat) also resulted in differences. In addition, Zoom recordings exhibited unexpected drops in intensity. The results suggest that lossless format phone recordings present a viable option for at least some phonetic studies.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005790/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005790<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>acoustic analysis; recording methods; mobile recording; remote data collection, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005790/v2.pdf">v2 [May 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005790/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>669 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005790">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005790">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
