The review also notes that this problem doesn't exist in meaning-based theories and that by ignoring these, Adger perpetuates the insularity that has marked Generative Linguistics since the 1970s.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002351/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002351<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>American Anthropologist</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>lyon's problem, x-bar theory, quantitative methodology, insularity, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2415 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002351">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002351">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
