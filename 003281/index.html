As a case study, a previous corpus-based research identified some specific sound symbolic relationships in Pokemon naming patterns in Japanese [1]. One of the main findings was that the names of Pokemon characters are more likely to contain voiced obstruents and are longer in terms of mora counts, when they undergo evolution (e.g. /nyoromo/ => /nyorobon/; /poppo/ => /pijotto/.). The current study reports three experiments that test whether (i) these patterns are productive in the minds of general Japanese speakers (Experiments 1 and 2), and whether (ii) the same tendency would hold with English speakers (Experiment 3). The results show that the effect of mora length was clearly observed both with Japanese speakers and English speakers; the effects of voiced obstruents were observed clearly with Japanese speakers, and less clearly with English speakers. Further analyses show that familiarity with Pokemon may influence their responses, suggesting the possibility that speakers can learn sound-symbolic patterns from a particular set of lexical items (i.e. “the Pokemon lexicon”). Besides its research value, we argue that this general project can be useful for undergraduate phonetics education.
