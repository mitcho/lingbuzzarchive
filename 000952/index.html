We observe that the assignment of the Dative to the Causee is only possible with verbal stems which assign Accusative to their internal arguments, and that all Dative Causees are subject to an animacy restriction. Japanese shares these two features with French, which has only one causative morpheme faire: we therefore propose a unified analysis of Dativization, which dispenses with the traditional dualistic approach to Japanese Causatives.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000952/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000952<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Proceedings of CLS 45</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>causatives, japanese, romance, animacy, applicative, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>494 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000952">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000952">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
