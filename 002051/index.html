evenly distributed among the world’s languages. This discussion note revisits a recent
experimental investigation of one such intriguing case, so-called ‘‘universal 18’’, by Culbertson,
Smolensky, and Legendre (2012). The authors find that adult learners are less
likely to generalize an artificial grammar that involves the word order combination Adjective-
before-Noun and Noun-before-Numeral, and they attribute this to two factors: (1) a
domain-general preference for consistency—i.e., a preference for either N before Adj/
Num, or N after, and (2) a domain-specific unlearned universal bias against Adj-N + NNum
order. An alternative explanation for the second factor is that it involves a transfer
effect from either Spanish-type languages or from English. The case for possible transfer
from English is based on the fact that adjectives regularly occur after the nouns they modify
in several English constructions, whereas numerals only quantify the nouns they follow
in one construction that occurs extremely infrequently.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002051/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002051<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cognition 127 420-426</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>learning bias, transfer effect, universal 18, universal grammar, constructions, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>345 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002051">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002051">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
