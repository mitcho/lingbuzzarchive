It will be argued that the Inclusiveness Condition and the No-tampering Condition necessitate, among other things, structure-generation without labeling/projection and cyclic derivation by phase. It will be further claimed that this restrictive model of syntax always generates, phase by phase, syntactic objects (SOs) of the form {H, α}, where H is a lexical item (LI) and α an SO. This restriction, referred to as the H-α schema, will be shown to derive a number of empirically grounded locality constraints in tandem with the Phase-Impenetrability Condition (Chomsky 2000, 2004, 2008), a desirable result both in terms of breadth of empirical coverage and theory-internal simplicity. Another important consequence is that the notion of endocentricity/headedness can no longer be attributed to (X-bar theoretic) projection. It will be claimed that each SO {H, α} can be eﬃciently assigned endocentric interpretation by the Conceptual-Intentional system (CI) and the Sensorimotor system (SM) via minimal search of LIs—H is always the head of {H, α}, primarily conﬁguring the interpretation of the SO. Full and consistent satisfaction of Full Interpretation is thereby achieved, maximally corroborating the desideratum of the Strong Minimalist Thesis.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001304/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001304<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Doctoral Dissertation, Harvard University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>merge, phase, full interpretation, inclusiveness, no-tampering condition, labeling, projection, endocentricity/headedness, the h-α schema, locality, island constraints, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3051 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001304">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001304">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
