The study also provides new phonetic facts on tone change, confirming the observation that there is no phonetic difference between the high level lexical tone and changed tone, and observes a length scale for changed tone duration in clipped syllables (clipped lexical < clipped changed < lexical long). The phonetic analysis also extends previous findings on the high rising TC, by showing that the changed tone may differ from the lexical high rising contour not only because it ends higher in pitch, but also because it starts lower and by its longer in duration.

Theoretically, the thesis attempts to provide a unified analysis of Cantonese tonologies in OT. It improves on previous analyses by integrating TC with observations about the tonematics of the language and the variation found across speakers and closely related varieties.  The suffix hypothesis is defended and proven to be capable of explaining micro-variation and the high rising TC near merger. Such analysis permits to shed further light on the historical origin of the suffix, in particular on how it changed. The suffix is lenited through successive steps, which are explained as being caused by the systemic pressure of the grammar for creating less  marked structures. The contrasting forces active synchronically are intimately related to those that lead to sound change, or at least to a subset of these. The conflicts are resolved by two means: a constraint re-ranking or a change in the UR form, both found in Cantonese.

Crucially, the sound changes are assumed to reflect the geographic distribution of the languages analyzed by the application of a norm well known to dialectologists and historical linguists. The synchronic analysis of closely-related grammars and of their variation, is then intended as the mirror of the changes that occurred within one grammar. As mentioned above, OT is a perfect tool to analyse the two planes simultaneously, as it naturally formalizes the grammar as a system of conflicting forces. This permits both a quantitative and qualitative comparison of the two planes by making explicit the elements of the change and those of the variation. Diachronic and geographic variation can indirectly provide important insights for the understanding of individual grammars as cognitive systems, especially in relation with phenomenon of language change, traditionally less studied in the generative tradition. 
The theory relies heavily on the study of diachronic and diatopic variation, and broadens our understanding of these areas, by  providing a model to measure the traditionally vacuous concept of 'linguistic distance' and a system to formalize internal conflicting forces operating in the grammar (a topic fundamental to the structuralist tradition, but neglected in early generative phonology).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001734/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001734<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>MA thesis</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>cantonese, tonology, tone change, microvariation, weitou, yue dialects, sound change, near merger, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>214 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001734">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001734">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
