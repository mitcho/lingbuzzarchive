Focussing on intransitive verbs and adjectives, we argue that the islandhood of subjects is determined by their status at the syntax-semantics interface: subjects qualify as islands when they are interpreted outside the predicative nucleus of the clause, in a categorical LF structure (in the sense of Ladusaw 1994); they are transparent for extraction when they undergo total reconstruction into the predicative nucleus of the clause, giving rise to a thetic structure. The thetic/categorical interpretation depends on various factors, most notably the stage-level vs. individual-level nature of the predicate. The interaction of different factors accounts for the observed variability of island effects, and is supported by our experimental evidence. We show that the transparency of reconstructed subjects need not be stipulated, but it falls out from a top-down oriented computation, in which movement dependencies are implemented by a storage-andretrieval (top-down, left-right) mechanism.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001957/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001957<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Inquiry Vol. 45.4 (Fall of 2014)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>subject island, reconstruction, categorical, thetic, top-down computation, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>364 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001957">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001957">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
