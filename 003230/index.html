There is a meaning difference that correlates with the positional difference: DAT1 is purely a structural case without any special meaning, while DAT2 has a directional meaning. The puzzle is solved by postulating case movement: the null head of a Path Phrase attracts the dative case to it. It is further shown that this movement interacts with the stranding-or-pied-piping options that generate word order differences as proposed in Jayaseelan (2010), to derive such facts as that Dutch signifies the locative/directional meaning difference by means of a preposition/postposition difference, and German signifies the same difference by a dative/accusative case alternation on the prepositional object.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003230/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003230<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>not published</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dative; case movement; malayalam; dutch; german; dative-accusative alternation, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>237 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003230">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003230">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
