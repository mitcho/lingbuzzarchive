But it is not clear how they actually relate to one another. This article argues that how properties of cognitive representations and formal/mathematical structures of natural language meaning can be united remains one of the puzzles in cognitive science. That is primarily because formal/mathematical structures of natural language meaning
are abstract, logical and truth-conditional properties, whereas cognitive/conceptual representations are embodied and grounded in sensory-motor systems. After reviewing the current progress, this work offers, in outline, the general formulations that show how these two different kinds of representations for semantic structures can (potentially) be unified and also proposes three desiderata for testing, in brain dynamics, the mathematical equivalence between formal symbolic representations (and their transitions) and neuronal population codes (and their transitions).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006844/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006844<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cognitive Science: https://doi.org/10.1111/cogs.13200</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>linguistic meaning, cognitive representations, formal structures, embodiment, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006844/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>458 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006844">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006844">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
