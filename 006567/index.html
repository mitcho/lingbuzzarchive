In this literature, Algonquian languages are held to be the prototypical example of a system in which the two kinds of inverses coexist: the inverse is a "deep" voice construction in clauses with two third-person arguments and a "shallow" alignment pattern in clauses in which a third person acts on an SAP. This paper argues that this conclusion is correct and attempts to reconcile it with formal models of voice and agreement. It is proposed that despite their distinct syntactic underpinnings, both inverse constructions result in a derivation in which Voice lacks phi-features and Infl indexes only the patient. This shared outcome explains why the inverse appears to be a unified phenomenon from a morphological perspective even though its syntactic correlates differ in third-person and SAP contexts.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006567/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006567<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Syntax</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>inverse, morphosyntactic alignment, voice, agreement, algonquian, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006567/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>557 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006567">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006567">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
