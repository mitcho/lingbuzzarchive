One type of association is PHONOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION, where the TBU to which the floating tone associates is determined by the general phonological grammar. Typically, this can be analyzed as default/unmarked position, e.g. to a stressed syllable or a domain-demarcating TBU. Another type is TARGETED ASSOCIATION, where the floating tone targets some specific numerical position within a domain, e.g. a floating H associates to the fourth TBU of the stem. Under this latter type, association is idiosyncratic to the sponsoring morpheme and does not (necessarily) target a default/unmarked position. In a study on the Bantu language Kuria, Marlo et al. (2015) and Paster (2019) take this latter type as evidence for counting in grammar, a position we argue against here. Instead, to account for the difference between two types of floating tone association patterns we propose a novel representation we call PHANTOM STRUCTURE. The main intuition behind phantom structure is that certain morphemes require structure to be present in order for their sponsored floating tone to be realized, but do not and cannot provide this structure themselves. We implement this via two partially overlapping correspondence relations: one between the actual, substantive input structure and output (IO-CORRESPONDENCE), and another between phantom and output structure (PhO-CORRESPONDENCE). We refer to the two inputs as the substantive plane and the phantom plane, respectively. In the input, the floating tone is actually pre-associated to a specific TBU position in the phantom plane. A simple constraint grammar requires the merger of these two input planes in the output, and results in the association of the floating tone to the equivalent numerical position in the output as in the phantom plane.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005187/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005187<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of AMP 2019</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>tone; floating tone; phonological representation; counting effects; optimality theory, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>218 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005187">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005187">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
