The widely adopted approach by Tsai (1994, 1999, 2008) is to draw a distinction between wh-nominals and wh-adverbs, where the former are unselectively bound by an operator in their 
scope position,
and the latter must raise at LF, thereby inducing island violations. The result is a hybrid approach where wide scope of wh-words is derived by two distinct mechanisms. 
In this paper, I show that the island-sensitivity of wh-adverbs can be captured in a unified approach based on the observation 
that island sensitivity correlates with the adjunction
height of the adverb. 
The resulting approach allows us to treat all in situ wh-phrases as unselectively binding and results in a unified theory of wh-in-situ which does not rely on LF movement. Furthermore, it will be shown how the analysis extends to other
observed asymmetries with regard to donkey anaphora and multiple wh-questions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003236/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003236<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Journal of East Asian Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>wh-in-situ, adjuncts, modification, scope, mandarin chinese, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1031 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003236">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003236">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
