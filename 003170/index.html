Cross-linguistic research has recently implied the need to reconsider ‘the more interaction, the more acquisition’ model. We are also reminded that structural-linguistic measures, such as vocabulary size and mean length of utterance are only one aspect of a child’s communicative competence, but some other skills related to pragmatics and conversation are required for language competence. The present study investigates the development of conversational and socio-pragmatic strategies in child discourse from a functional perspective. We especially focus on the impact of the parental input, and question the role of child’s mother in the development of a child’s conversational skills with particular regard to the question-answer forming, positive and negative reinforcement, the effects of frequency, and length of conversation. Our research aims to establish the relationship between the challenging communicative environment (lengthy conversations, parent-initiated speech, answers-at-hand, avoidance of motherese, etc.) and the development of a child’s communicative competence. Our participants have been selected from 5 families. The group comprises totally 5 mothers and 5 Turkish-speaking children. We classified the families as conservative, conservative-pragmatic or modern-educated, and the children as younger and older. The data has been collected via open-ended interviews, and has been transcribed and tagged for analysis. We have found various patterns in parental input shaping a child’s discourse, and the results revealed a significant difference between the two target groups’ conversational strategies, which is due to the critical age for discourse strategies. While the mother’s attempt to adapt her discourse resulted in self-confidence and freedom to question in children, as well as encouragement in initiating conversation to the older children, discouragement from asking questions and from discussing with older individuals had the reverse effect on the older children.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003170/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003170<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>International Journal of Early Childhood Education Studies</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>child language development, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>408 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003170">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003170">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
