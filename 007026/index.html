This is the entire transcript of Prof. Noam Chomsky's ten-part lecture series titled -- Language and the "Cognitive Revolutions" -- given at the University of Girona, Catalonia, between 23rd and 27th November, 1992. The document is "unofficial" in the sense that it is sort of "fan-made", and not (say) a preprint from a publisher. I have taken considerable liberty in some places to rephrase the sentences in the running discourse for better readability. I have added appropriate images (sourced from Google Image searches) at places where I thought the lecture was getting much too pictorial. At the end of every lecture there was a substantial Q&A session, the content of which I have not included here, partly because most of it overlapped with the lectures' content. Sometimes audience members asked in-lecture questions, and I have included two such questions (not all), where I felt that it would be an interesting interpolation. If you find any major errors in the text, please write me an email so that I could upload newer versions of it here on Ling Buzz.




[ABOUT THE LECTURES =] 

Prof. Chomsky talks about how the two cognitive revolutions that took place in the post-Galilean period -- the Cartesian one and the 1950's one which he contributed to -- came about in the course of naturalistic inquiry into the nature of the mind. He adds that the second revolution only picked up the forgotten ideas of the first, and so wasn't a real revolution.

Externalist approaches to studying the mind, he says, veer off into total irrationality because of a pernicious epistemological dualism which makes the mind immune to normal scientific inquiry. Prof. Chomsky speculates that the philosophers approaching the mind in such a fashion are unconsciously guided by the remnants of the traditional church's approach that regarded the soul as something sacred, special, etc. The picture he paints is that of like charges repelling each other as they come closer.

After Newton's demolition of the mechanical worldview, there is now no coherent concept of the physical/material left, which leaves matter to be "whatever there is." Failure to recognize this fundamental insight of the Newtonian revolution has steered philosophers into irrationality, which, Prof. Chomsky says, is illustrative of a kind of epistemological dualism. This post-Newtonian epistemological dualism is unlike the Cartesian metaphysical dualism, which was a result of a naturalistic inquiry, he explains.

With the arrival of computers, the idea that the mind equals software was helpful as a conceptual framework, but this has, again, steered mainstream contemporary cognitive science into irrationality by abstracting away from biology (from the brain) in principle, leading to absurd claims in fields like AI (about thinking machines and suchlike). Various other pitfalls that this pernicious kind of dualism leads us into are discussed in relation to thought experiments that philosophers (Searle, Putnam, Kripke, Burge, etc.) have proposed over the years. In parallel, Prof. Chomsky sketches a naturalistic path to studying the mind that could potentially achieve something substantial -- the generative enterprise that he's involved in.

Prof. Chomsky clarifies that he is not saying that these non-naturalistic approaches will never arrive at the truth, but that they bear a heavy burden of justification (in contrast to the naturalistic approach). He shows that the arguments given by some philosophers to meet this burden are untenable (to say the least) and hence such non-naturalistic approaches should be abandoned forthwith.

These lectures will serve as a sharp ray of light cutting through contemporary irrationality in fields such as AI (the bold claims of which are circulating in  the mainstream media), and will hopefully help switch inquiry onto a serious, naturalistic path. This text is a wellspring of illuminating ideas, and will be highly enlightening to curious students of the mind.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007026/current.html">html</a> ][ <a href="/lingbuzz/007026/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007026<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>cognitive revolution, descartes, galileo, newton, wittgenstein, searle, putnam, kripke, tyler burge, michael dummett, donald davidson, richard lewontin, generative grammar, i-language, noam chomsky, internalist, mind, naturalism, dualism, quine, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, jerry fodor, la mettrie, joseph priestley, jacques de vaucanson, cartesian dualism, semantics, syntax, artificial intelligence, mind, mental, churchland, naturalistic inquiry, rationalism, automata, aristotle, universal grammar, phonology, phonetic form, panini, indian linguistics, leonard bloomfield, otto jespersen, sanskrit</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>825 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007026">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007026">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
