After some introductory remarks (§ 1), in § 2 we review some current analyses of sentence topics and contrastive topics and consider their role in conversational dynamics (Krifkas 2007 common ground management). We then derive the root restriction on topics from an interface requirement: since they affect the conversational dynamics, they must be hosted in clauses endowed with illocutive force. In § 3 we adopt a threefold distinction of topics (Aboutness-Shift, Contrastive and Familiar/Given Topics), based on Frascarelli and Hinterhölzls (2007) investigation on the formal and interface properties of dislocated constituents in Italian and German; we then show that the well-known opposition between Italian and English-like topic constructions with respect to embedded realizations only concerns Familiar/Given topics, which do not affect the conversational dynamics at all. Romance Clitic Left Dislocation is therefore not a real counterexample to the root restriction. In § 4, on the other hand, we call into question Bürings (2003) definition of the Contrastive Topic and show the need for a reconsideration of its semantic and formal properties; we provide overwhelming evidence that English Contrastive Topics are not subject to the root restriction, since they have genuinely embedded interpretations and can be found in non-asserted complement clauses. We then propose a novel analysis for this type of topic. In § 5 we reconsider Aboutness-shift Topics, showing that they fully respect the root restriction. However, we argue that Portner and Yabushitas (1988) «root promotion» of embedded topics is incorrect and we discuss Krifkas (2001) suggestion that the A-Topic instantiates an independent speech act. § 6 resumes the problem of root-like clauses and offers a tentative solution for their «quasi-assertive» role.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000954/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000954<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>manuscript</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>aboutness-shift (a-)topic, contrastive (c-)topic, common ground, conversational dynamics, familiar/given (g-)topic, illocutive force, interface, root restriction, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>582 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000954">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000954">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
