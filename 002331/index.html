that transitive subject agreement need not always involve a high functional head, i.e. T0, but may
instead be the result of a local relation between the subject and a low functional head, v0. In
Mayan languages, grammatical relations are head-marked on the predicate through two series of
morphemes, known as “Set A” (ergative/possessive) and “Set B” (absolutive). I argue that Set
A morphemes reflect a local relationship of agreement between transitive v0 and the subject in
its specifier position and, in an analogous structural configuration, between possessive n0 and the
possessor. Crucially, I show that no higher functional projection is involved. This is important
in light of proposals that ergative agreement systems are epiphenomenal, resulting from standard
nominative agreement from T0 which is blocked from agreeing with morphologically case-marked
ergative subjects (Woolford 2010). In this paper I examine the morphologically ergative Mayan
language Chol to show true ergative agreement is possible even in the absence of morphological
case. This paper has implications for the typology of ergative case and agreement systems, and
contributes to our understanding of the nature of agreement and clitic doubling.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002331/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002331<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Syntax</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agreement, clitics, ergativity, ergative agreement, mayan, chol, templatic morphology, non-finite clauses, morphology, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002331/v2.pdf">v2 [October 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002331/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2276 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002331">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002331">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
