It will propose a particular way of understanding the notion of a rhetic act and argue that it is extremely well-reflected in the semantics of natural language.  The paper will furthermore outline a novel, unified and compositional semantics of quotation which is guided by two ideas. First, quotations convey properties related to lower-level (phonetic or phatic) linguistic acts; second, such meanings of quotations are strictly based on syntactic structure, namely a lower-level (phonetic, phonological or morpho-syntactic) structure as part of the syntactic structure that is input to semantic interpretation.  Such lower-level linguistic structures will contribute properties of utterances, to the semantic composition of the sentence, in one way or another.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003140/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003140<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>S.L.
