In "The company hired 70% of the women", the cardinality of the women that are hired is compared to the cardinality of all the women (a proportional reading). In "The company hired 70% women", on the other hand, the cardinality of the women that are hired is compared to the cardinality of all the hired individuals (a reverse-proportional reading). This paper is concerned with the form-meaning relations associated with proportional measurement constructions and reverse proportional measurement constructions in Turkish. Proportional numerals inside reverse proportional expressions appear to violate a semantic universal known as the Conservativity Constraint. Building on previous research, we propose a Conservativity-compatible analysis for such constructions in Turkish. We claim that these expressions exhibit non-conservativity effects due to the fact that the noun inside them is interpreted only in its vP-internal position. Proportional measurement constructions, on the other hand, undergo DP-movement, as a result of which the noun inside them is interpreted both in the tail and in the head of the movement chain, blocking non-conservativity effects. We show that the analysis developed in this paper for proportional expressions also accounts for the distribution of non-conservative readings of the proportional context-sensitive determiners "many" and "few".<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006532/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006532<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Glossa Special Issue ed by U.
