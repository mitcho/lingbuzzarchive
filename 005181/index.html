and cyclically in what are known as grammaticalization paths. Although the
observations that give rise to these characterizations are cross-linguistically robust, the representations
and cognitive processes that support these shifts are still not well understood.
This dissertation bridges that gap through the use of corpus studies and experimental methods,
providing a characterization of the forces at play in semantic variation and change.
The focus is on the progressive-to-imperfective shift. In this change, languages that
have only one marker for habitual and event-in-progress readings recruit a new marker for
the event-in-progress one. The two markers slowly undergo a categoricalization process,
where each marker gets restricted to one reading, until the new marker generalizes to both
readings and pushes the old marker out of the language. I look at this change in Spanish,
since it currently presents two diachronically-related markers that convey these readings:
the Simple Present and the Present Progressive. However, there is a many-to-many mapping
between forms and meanings: both markers can express both readings, showing that a full
categorical stage has not yet been achieved, though a generalization process is already
underway. What are the contextual conditions that enable the use of each marker for each
reading? Are these constraints related to the diachronic development of the markers?
To address these questions, I propose that semantic variation and change are rooted in
the structure of the meanings that participate in the shift and in the contextual conditions
in which these markers are interpreted. On the basis of clear formal characterizations of
the progressive and the imperfective, I argue that these meanings share a conceptual
structure that allows for variation and change to occur. As for the contextual conditions, I
propose that shared perceptual access between speaker and hearer is the relevant factor
preventing full categoricalization. Shared perceptual access is a contextual means to attain Perspective Alignment, a communicative goal grounded on two complementary
cognitive capacities: Common Ground and Theory of Mind. While the former aords the
speaker greater reliance on context, the latter forces her to be linguistically explicit. As for
the generalization of the Present Progressive to habitual readings, I argue that it preferentially
occurs in contexts that satisfy the presuppositional requirement of estar (the
auxiliary verb in the Present Progressive); that is, in contexts that entertain salient alternatives
at which the proposition at issue does not hold. Given its semantic composition, the
Present Progressive conveys the habitual reading and implicates a rejected alternative, maximizing
context set restriction, increasing the informativity of the expression, and making
it overtime preferable to the Simple Present, which conveys the habitual reading alone.
These hypotheses are tested in three ways. A corpus study across three time periods
conrms the role of shared perceptual access as the crucial contextual condition in the
diachronic interplay of these markers. Acceptability judgments tasks and self-paced reading
studies also assess the role of these contextual constraints in three Spanish dialects (Central
Peninsular, Mexican Altiplano, and Rioplatense). Results show that the Present Progressive
is the preferred marker to express the event-in-progress reading (higher acceptability,
shorter reading times), but the Simple Present can still convey it when speaker and hearer
share perceptual access. This contextual boost disappears in Mexican Spanish, where
participants reject the Simple Present regardless of context. For the habitual reading, the
Simple Present is the preferred marker, but the Present Progressive can be used when the
presuppositional content of estar is satised by the context. In Mexican Spanish, this
contextual support is not needed. Thus, the data show that Mexican Spanish is further
along the grammaticalization path than its Rioplatense and Peninsular counterparts.
Altogether, the patterns observed across dialects are consistent with a model of semantic
variation and change embedded in a communicative system, visible during real-time
comprehension, and subject to identiable contextual factors. On the one hand, linguistic
markers compete to optimize Common Ground and Theory of Mind pressures, supporting
each dialect's advancement in their own path of change. On the other hand, the generalization
process is shown to be driven by the contrastive informativity strength of the combined
lexico-semantic properties of the Present Progressive marker.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005181/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005181<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>New Haven, CT, USA.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>imperfective, progressive, context, real-time methods, semantic change, grammaticalization</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005181/v2.pdf">v2 [June 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005181/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>710 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005181">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005181">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
