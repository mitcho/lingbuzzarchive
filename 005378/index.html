Fission is often seen as a by-product of a composite Vocabulary Insertion mechanism determining which features are split up, where they are linearized, and how they are spelled out. An alternative view which presupposes a modular postsyntax assigns operational autonomy to rules responsible for feature splitting, displacement, and exponence. I argue that the latter approach is empirically superior on the basis of a novel set of allomorphic alternations from Semitic which demonstrate that Fission and displacement feed, and hence cannot be equated with, Vocabulary Insertion. The result is that the inventory of postsyntactic operations must include at least the following three operations: Fission, Metathesis, and Vocabulary Insertion.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005378/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005378<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>morphology; fission; discontinuous agreement; allomorphy; displacement; semitic, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>216 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005378">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005378">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
