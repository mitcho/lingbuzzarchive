Creation and consumption verbs with a definite theme can be interpreted both ways, as can verbs of directed motion with a specified endpoint. However, creation and consumption verbs with an indefinite enumerated theme are telic only. I examine the properties of variably telic accomplishment predicates—those having both a telic and an atelic interpretation—and argue that atelicity derives from the properties of a scale encoded by the predicate (Hay et al. 1999; Kennedy & Levin 2008; Kennedy 2012) or from the relation that holds between a function measuring change and a comparison point used to evaluate that change. Supporting evidence for these two sources of atelicity comes from a post-verbal particle hĭ, which forces a telic reading for creation and consumption accomplishments, but not for motion accomplishments.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002091/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002091<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of AFLA 20</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>jarai, telicity, culmination, scales of change, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>380 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002091">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002091">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
