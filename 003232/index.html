I present a new model for deriving phonological typology within the Channel Bias approach. First, a new subdivision of natural processes is proposed: non-natural processes are divided into unmotivated and unnatural. The central topic of the paper is an unnatural alternation: post-nasal devoicing. I argue that in all reported cases, post-nasal devoicing does not derive from a single unnatural sound change (as claimed in some individual accounts of the data), but rather from a combination of three sound changes, each of which is natural and moti- vated. By showing that one of the rare cases of unnatural sound change reported actually arises through a combination of natural sound changes, we can maintain the long-held position that any single instance of sound change has to be natural. Based on several discussed cases, I propose a new diachronic model for explaining unnatural phenomena: the Blurring Process. Additionally, I provide a proof establishing the minimal sound changes required for an unmotivated/unnatural process to arise. The Blurring Process and Minimal Sound Change Requirement result in a model that probabilistically predicts typology within the Channel Bias approach. This paper also introduces the concept of Historical Probabilities of Alternations (PÏ‡) and presents a groundwork for their estimation called Bootstrapping Sound Changes. The ultimate goal of the new model is to quantify the influences of Channel Bias on phonological typology.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003232/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003232<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonological typology, probabilistic modeling, bootstrapping, sound change, naturalness, channel bias, voice, post-nasal devoicing</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003232/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>404 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003232">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003232">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
