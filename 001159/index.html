It was laid out in Ségéral & Scheer (2001a)  and has known various implementations and applications.  In this paper we develop the Coda Mirror further by amending its mechanics in one central point: government and licensing are not equal-righted. The motivation for this move comes from the word-final (or rather: domain-final, see Kaye 1995) situation, i.e. where non-phonological factors come into play. Shaping linguistic theory according to interface requirements is of course a very minimalist thing to do.The new system provides a comprehensive definition of the difference between open and closed syllables: Nuclei in open syllables are always licensed, which explains why vowels in this position show the maximal vocalic inventory. They are unlicensed (i.e. unsupported) in closed syllables and therefore typically host inventories whose melodic distribution is curtailed.

A last virtue of the Coda Mirror v2 to be mentioned is that it does away with the schizophrenia of intervocalic consonants. These were both governed and licensed before, and it was unclear how they could obey both antagonistic forces at the same time, or why they do not cancel each other out. In the amended system, schizophrenic consonants do not occur anymore since no constituent can be simultaneously governed and licensed.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001159/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001159<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Acta Linguistica Hungarica</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syllable, typology, coda mirror, government phonology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>75 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001159">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001159">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
