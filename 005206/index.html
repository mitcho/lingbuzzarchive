Focusing on ARCs, with data from English, French and German (Poschmann 2019), we explore an alternative to Potts’s bidimensional account in which (i) appositives may be syntactically attached with matrix scope, despite their appearance in embedded positions; (ii) they may also be syntactically attached within the scope of other operators, in which case they semantically interact with them; (iii) they are semantically conjoined with the rest of the sentence, but (iv) they give rise to non-trivial projection facts when they do not have matrix scope.  In effect, our analysis accounts for most of the complexity of these data by positing a more articulated syntax and pragmatics, while keeping the semantics ‘lean’ and unidimensional.
