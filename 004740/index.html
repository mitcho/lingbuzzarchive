In this work, I observe the relationship between lexicons extracted from modern child-directed speech and those drawn from modern and historical literary corpora in order to better understand when language acquisition can be modeled over historical and non-child corpora as it is over child corpora. The type frequencies of morphophonological and syntactic-semantic patterns occur at similar type frequencies in these corpora among high token frequency items, and furthermore, when a learning algorithm is applied to lexicons sampled from these sources, it consistently achieves the same learning outcomes in each. With appropriate care and pre-processing, modern and historical text corpora are effectively interchangeable with child-directed speech corpora for the purpose of estimating child lexical experience, opening a path for modeling language acquisition where child-directed corpora are not available. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004740/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004740<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>accepted to Glossa</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>child language acquisition, corpus linguistics, historical linguistics, english, latin, proto-germanic, spanish, icelandic, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>274 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004740">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004740">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
