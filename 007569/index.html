They also demonstrate that one QUD-based Q-equivalence approach — namely, Barros (2014) — has shortcomings in its current form. From this, Barros and Kotek conclude that, even if a Q-equivalence approach can be developed that does not exhibit the same shortcomings that AnderBois’ and Barros’ theories do, this approach will require supplementary assumptions and technical machinery that are/is not required under a focus-based ap-proach. Thus, a focus-based approach is favoured on conceptual grounds, as it is more parsimonious. I contend that this conclusion is unwarranted. I argue that it arises from an unbalanced comparison, in which (i) the least feasible QUD-based approach is treated as the exemplar of QUD-based approaches more generally and (ii) data that supports QUD-based approaches and/or undermines Barros & Kotek’s focus-based approach are neglected. I will show that, once a more balanced com-parison is made, any QUD-based approach that is more fleshed-out than Barros’ (2014) is superior to the focus-based approach. [Written in Aug 2020.
