Kaaps is a grammatically understudied, historically rich and marginalised variety of Afrikaans. Special attention is given to the use of verb second (V2) and verb-third (V3) in relation to sociolinguistic variables such as location, language background and age. V2 and V3 refer to the position of the verb in a sentence and are typical properties of West Germanic languages. The study aims to understand possible variations in V2 and V3 and to locate this variation in relation to sociolinguistic intricacies. Syntactic patterns gathered from this research will contribute to the documentation and description of Kaaps grammar, to our understanding of word order variation in Kaaps and in Afrikaans more generally, and they will also provide insight into how Kaaps fits into the West Germanic language family. This study focuses on Kaaps spoken in Manenberg, a community on the Cape Flats, Cape Town, South Africa. An overarching aim of this study is to contribute to the efforts of bridging the gap between sociolinguistic and syntactic studies, which are traditionally treated as being unrelated.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006875/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006875<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cape Town, South Africa</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sociosyntax, west germanic languages, afrikaans grammar, kaaps, clausal word order, variation, verb-second, verb-third, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>309 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006875">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006875">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
