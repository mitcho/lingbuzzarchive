In this pattern, DP and third-plural subjects trigger nominative agreement, while third-singular and local-person pronouns trigger absolutive agreement;   ergative agreement occurs simultaneously. It is proposed that the DP and third-plural arguments differ in their feature structure from that of other pronominal arguments; they bear D-features in excess of traditional phi-features, and agreement is able to target these D-features even if the argument has already undergone ergative phi-agreement. Multiple ergative and nominative agreement with a single argument is therefore possible because different groups of features are targeted during different agreement operations. This results in what initially appears to be inter-language variation in the applicability of the Activity Condition (Chomsky 2001). The paper sheds light on the feature-specific nature of Agree, and presents an elaboration on the organization and role of nominal feature geometries in grammar, including variation in the crosslinguistic representation of number.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004389/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004389<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, features, agreement, ergativity, tsimshianic, gitksan, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004389/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>192 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004389">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004389">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
