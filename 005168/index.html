The two types of anaphors in the language, reflexives and reciprocals, seem to display an opposite directionality in binding: reflexives appear to provide evidence for a syntactically accusative clause structure, with the ergative external argument c-commanding the absolutive theme, while reciprocals provide evidence for a syntactically ergative clause structure wherein the absolutive theme c-commands and binds the ergative agent. The close examination of the expression of reflexive and reciprocal relations in a variety of contexts uncovers the generalization that both types of pronouns behave as standard anaphors subject to standard locality conditions on binding, but reflexives are additionally constrained by a licensing condition which limits their set of possible antecedents to the highest argument in the theta-domain. The puzzling mismatch in binding directionality is thus reduced to well-understood and cross-linguistically attested patterns. The paper sheds light on the syntactic conditions governing anaphor licensing and on the role of subjecthood as a type of syntactic primitive: in West Circassian, subjecthood diagnostics fail to single out a single nominal as a subject, thus rendering this notion theoretically vacuous.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005168/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005168<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>resubmitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ergativity, subject, subjecthood, reflexive, reciprocal, binding, west circassian, adyghe, northwest caucasian, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005168/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>510 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005168">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005168">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
