– a possibility which seems initially to be both theoretically and typologically
anomalous. This paper explores some theoretical consequences of that fact.  It begins by
arguing (following Acquaviva 1996) that Irish entirely lacks the kind of inherently
negative expressions which appear in Negative Concord systems. It possesses instead a rich
inventory of NPI's. The possibility of fragment NPI's is linked with an independent
property of the language -- namely, that it possesses a clause-bound movement operation,
known as Narrative Fronting (Ó Siadhail (1989), McCloskey (1996)), in which a narrow scope
indefinite may be raised to a position to the left of the verb in a finite negative
clause. A crucial property of this fronting is that it does not expand the scope of the
fronted indefinite. The proposed linking eliminates the apparent anomaly and (initial
appearances notwithstanding) provides an argument in favour of the move-and-delete line of
analysis for fragment answers advocated especially by Jason Merchant (2004). It also
brings some non-trivial implications for the theory of recoverability for ellipsis.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007831/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007831<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>negative polarity items; fragments, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>164 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007831">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007831">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
