The general proposal is that there is a correlation between the phase structure, the tripartite quantificational structure and the information structure of the sentence. At the semantic interface, the vP phase is interpreted as the nuclear scope of the quantificational structure and the information-focus domain of the information structure and the CP phase is interpreted as the restrictive clause of the quantificational structure and the background domain. This correlation plays an important role not only in referential and information-structural properties of arguments and the verb but also in adverbial properties. It is argued that adverbials generally can be merged in the vP phase and that under the right circumstances they can occur in the sentence-final position. It is shown that certain sentence adverbials can occur in the sentence-final position in the vP phase when they represent the extreme value with respect to the set of focus alternatives. The proposed correlation also plays an important role in anaphoric relations with respect to adjuncts. Only a backgrounded r-expression in an adjunct clause can corefer with the coindexed pronoun in a clause distinct from the adjunct clause, that is, an r-expression that is sufficiently distant from the coindexed pronoun in the structure and that is spelled out and interpreted in the CP phase of the adjunct clause. It is also shown that the phase structure is an important factor in adverbial ordering. It is argued that relative orders of adverbials expressing an interval are determined by the natural evolution of spatiotemporal domains - namely, by the Principle of Natural Evolution of Intervals - and that this principle is restricted to phase domains. Thus, the relative order of adverbials expressing an interval can be reversed if they occur in different phases.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000909/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000909<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ph.D. dissertation, University of Leipzig</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phase, adverbial, movement, adjunct clause, adverbial ordering, tripartite structure, information structure, czech, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1390 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000909">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000909">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
