We argue that Washo offers evidence that both complementation and modification are available strategies for subordination, and in doing so contribute more specifically to the ongoing debate about how clauses are embedded by attitude verbs. We observe that the embedding strategies of certain predicates in Washo follow from independent properties of clause types in the language. On the one hand, clauses embedded by presuppositional verbs come in the form of clausal nominalizations, which are selected as thematic internal arguments. The DP- layer in these complements is responsible for encoding familiarity in a general sense (along the lines of Kastner 2015) both in complement clauses as well as in other constructions in the language. On the other hand, clauses embedded by non-presuppositional verbs are not selected at all; they are instead adjunct modifiers, which follows from the fact that the attitude verbs they modify are always intransitive. This aspect of the analysis lends support to the property-analysis of ‘that’-clauses (e.g., Moulton 2009, Elliott 2016), but only in certain instances of embedding. We argue that the Washo facts show that selection still plays a role for some verbs, contra theories that do away with it altogether (Elliott 2016), but selection cannot explain everything either, as non-presuppositional verbs are intransitive and do not select at all.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005479/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005479<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Accepted at Natural Language & Linguistic Theory</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>clausal embedding, clausal nominalization, factivity, modification, complementation, washo, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005479/v2.pdf">v2 [March 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005479/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1226 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005479">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005479">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
