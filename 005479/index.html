Adding to this line of work, we contribute novel data from Washo, a highly endangered Hokan/isolate language spoken around Lake Tahoe in the United States, to the debate on why – and how – attitude predicates differ in the types of clauses they embed.  The core of our claim is that the clausal embedding strategies of certain predicates follow from independent properties of clause types  in  the  language,  and  is  not  tied  to  factivity per  se.   On  the  one  hand,  clausal  complements  of factive verbs come in the form of clausal nominalizations, whose DP-layer is responsible for encoding familiarity in a general sense (along the lines of Kastner 2015) both in factive complements and beyond. Clauses embedded by non-factive verbs on the other hand are not selected at all; they are instead adjunct modifiers, which follows from the fact that the attitude verbs they modify are always intransitive.  This aspect of the analysis lends support to the property-analysis of ‘that’-clauses (e.g., Kratzer 2006, Moulton 2009, Elliott 2016), but only in certain instances of embedding. The overarching goal of the paper is to rethink the relationship between factivity and clausal embedding from a more global perspective of a given language, and to elucidate the distinction between complementation and modification as available modes of embedding.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005479/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005479<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>clausal embedding, clausal nominalization, factivity, modification, complementation, washo, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>95 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005479">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005479">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
