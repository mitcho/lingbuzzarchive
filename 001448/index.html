I focus on the structural rather than the functional aspect of online CS. I discuss the distributional features of inflected and non-inflected borrowed verbs in order to determine which structural pattern of CS is predominant in the corpus. My objective is to contribute to the empirical and descriptive study of CS among Cameroonian internet users. The assumptions adopted in this paper are based on Myers-Scotton’s (2002, 2008) 4-M model of morphemes classification in CS data. I seek to uncover a number of constraints that account for when Embedded Language (EL) elements in bilingual speech may take Matrix Language (ML) inflection and when they may surface as bare forms. This question is especially relevant with regards to verbs. While Myers-Scotton does invoke the congruence hypothesis, her writings do not work this out sufficiently. In the case of Camfranglais (the term used to describe the data I am investigating), there is a further interest because CS ordinarily entails a ML-EL pair but here there is a ML (French) and multiple EL’s, specifically English, Pidgin, Duala, and Ewondo. The findings of this study are consistent with 4-M model predictions (at least for finite verbs and present participles) in that all grammatical morphemes and word order are that of French, the dominant language that sets the morphosyntactic frame of the clause in Camfranglais. However, the congruence hypothesis does not explain why bare forms overwhelmingly occur in Camgfranglais data. Using quantitative data concerning the structural distribution of EL verbs in Camfranglais, I show that the model proposed here has more explanatory power than the 4-M model in regards to the existence of bare forms.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001448/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001448<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>New York University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>borrowed verbs, code-switching, 4-m model, congruence, matrix language, embedded language, bare verbs, inflected verbs, french, duala, ewondo, pidgin, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001448/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2010]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>911 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001448">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001448">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
