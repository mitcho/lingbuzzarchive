As this “stray” focal stress (SFS) phenomenon has received almost no attention in the literature, we begin by describing its distributional, phonological, and semantic properties. We then propose an analysis whereby SFS arises as a side effect of a syntactic derivation in which the domain of F-marking happens not to map to any segmentally-overt material at PF. As a result of this, the focus prosody must look for a host elsewhere, only finding an optimal host on PF material corresponding to a position outside the F-marked domain. In the SFS data we analyze in this paper, the null F-marked element sits in the low left periphery and contributes meaning relating to the speaker's beliefs, encoding their degree of certainty about the assertion. However, our analysis also predicts that SFS should arise in various other configurations where null operators are under semantic focus. By characterizing these general conditions for SFS, we hope to provide a blueprint for the identification and analysis of other such semantics-prosody misalignments.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006064/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006064<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of WCCFL 39</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>focus prosody, focus semantics, intonation, syntax-phonology interface, syntax-semantics interface, english, semantics, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>338 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006064">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006064">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
