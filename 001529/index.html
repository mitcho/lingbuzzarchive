The multimorphemic character of a given form is also often taken to bear on the issue, particularly when the morpheme order mirrors the order of the extended projection in the syntax. However, it is clear that just as there can be head-movement without affixation, there can be affixation without head-movement. Even the issue of which morpheme orders can properly be taken as 'mirroring' the syntax is somewhat more complex in implementation than commonly assumed. In addition to the mirroring options available, additional mechanisms must be at work in deriving certain types of complex forms. An analysis of the Cupeño verbal complex is argued to involve an intricate interplay of independently motivated possibilities. Finally, some of the formal problems posed by the usual head-adjunction analysis of head movement are reviewed, and a brief overview of some alternative theoretical approaches to head-movement is given.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001529/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001529<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in n Diagnosing Syntax, Lisa Cheng and Norbert Corver (eds), Oxford: OUP.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>cupeño, the extension condition, merger under adjacency, m-merger, cyclicity, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001529/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2012]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1779 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001529">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001529">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
