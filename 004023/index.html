I refer to this as OO-Corr via ABP. Agreement by Projection is a recent proposal in Hansson (2014) coming out of the Agreement by Correspondence literature, which states that constraints can enforce agreement of a feature across a ‘projection’ of segments. The central innovation of this paper is that I extend this notion of ‘projection’ to sets of outputs (e.g. outputs of a paradigm) over which agreement is enforced (e.g. with respect to root shape, word shape, etc.). I illustrate the OO-Corr via ABP model for different types of output-to-output similarity, including paradigmatic and transparadigmatic OO-Corr types involving networks of output forms. Finally, I argue that OO-Corr via ABP unites two distinct cases in the paradigm uniformity literature: ‘majority rules effects’ seen in McCarthy’s (2005) work on Optimal Paradigms, and ‘least marked effects’ seen in Steriade’s (1999, 2008) work on ‘lexical conservatism’.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004023/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004023<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>NELS 48 Proceedings 2018 - Iceland</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>output-output correspondence, morphological bases, agreement by projection, agreement by correspondence, paradigm uniformity, majority rules effects, lexical conservatism, morphology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>436 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004023">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004023">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
