Although Philippine-type Austronesian languages display apparent hallmarks of syntactic ergativity, a closer examination of the distribution of three basic case markers reveals that the ergative characteristics are only illusory. Support for an accusative analysis comes firstly from the presence of the putative oblique case on ECM subjects, derived objects, and objects inside restructuring infinitives – a distribution that undermines the traditional antipassive view of Philippine-type Actor Voice. Further evidence comes from the locality-constrained distribution of the alleged inherent ergative case, which shows the hallmarks of structural nominative, suggest- ing that the extraction restriction attested across these languages is distinct from the ban on ergative extraction. Finally, the non-local distribution of the so-called absolutive case reveals that it is a marker independent of case, in line with previous topic analyses of this marker. Accordingly, ‘Philippine-type alignment’ essentially reflects an ordinary accusative case system obscured by prominent topic-marking that overrides morphological case. This conclusion lends novel support to the accusative view of Tagalog (Richards 2000; Chen 2021) and Malagasy (Pearson2001) and yields two implications:(i) highly constrained A-bar extraction asymmetry may be independent of syntactic ergativity, and (ii) discourse configurational languages may superficially exhibit traits of ergativity if their topic-marking is imprecisely treated as part of their case system.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007741/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007741<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>austronesian-type alignment, philippine-type voice, ergativity, antipassive, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>359 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007741">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007741">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
