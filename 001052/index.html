Albagarah, Ayah 31)

Before they can add 2+2, children are conjoining sentences, asking questions,

selecting appropriate pronouns, negating sentences and using the phonological,

morphological, syntactic and semantic rules of language. Yet, children are not

taught language as they are taught arithmetic. Children learn many things as they

are developing from infancy to maturity, but they learn these things in different

ways.

A normal human being can go through life without having learned to read or

write. Millions of people in the world today prove this. However, these same

millions all speak and understand and can discuss complex and abstract ideas as

well as literate speakers can. Thus learning a language and learning to read are

somehow different. Similarly, millions of humans grow to maturity without ever

having learned algebra or chemistry or how to use a typewriter. They must in

some sense be taught these skills or systems, but they do not have to be taught to

walk or talk. Language learning is largely from the inside out rather than

being outside in (Gleitman, 1993:28).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001052/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001052<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Bulletin of the Documentation and Humanities Research Centre, Vol. (1999) (pp.7-26) Qatar</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language acquisition, phonology, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>88 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001052">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001052">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
