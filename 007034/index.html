First, apparent mismatches occur: <i>singular</i> marking is used for some <i>dual</i> subjects and <i>dual</i> marking is used for some <i>paucal</i> subjects. Second, the singular-dual mismatch is conditioned by the position of an apparently unrelated element, the non-sibling marker <i>ngintha/nintha</i>. Nordlinger and Mansfield (2021) argue that this pattern diverges from known morphotactic principles reported in the literature.
<br><br>
In this paper, I propose that the facts emerge solely from the action of Agree (Chomsky 2000) operating over a featurally complex representation of number (Harbour 2014). Mismatches result from partially-defective intervention: Agree takes place not with the subject itself, but with the non-sibling marker -- an intervening element which bears a subset of the subject's features.
<br><br>
The analysis hinges on some interesting theoretical assumptions:
<br>
a. Number is encoded using Harbour's (2014) feature system.
<br>
b. All else equal, learners will posit the smallest set of probe features necessary to encode the contrasts present in the agreement morphology (building on Preminger 2019).
<br>
c. Morphemes expone meanings denoted by feature sets (rather than exponing features directly).
<br>
d. Mobile affixation is syntactic (at least in this instance).
<br><br>
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the relevant generalizations, following Nordlinger and Mansfield 2021. Section 3 introduces assumptions a. and b. Section 4 proposes that mismatched number agreement is derived from partially-defective intervention. I show that this analysis is able to account for the full pattern, provided we adopt assumptions c. and d. Section 5 discusses a puzzle that the mobile affixation pattern raises for linearization and modularity. Section 6 briefly concludes.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007034/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007034<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of CLS 58, to appear</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agreement, intervention, mobile affixation, kinship, morphosyntax, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>365 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007034">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007034">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
