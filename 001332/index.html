Our account is based on the following core assumptions. (i) In languages with person agreement, the person specification of the verb is identical to that of the subject, even where this is not reflected by surface forms. (ii) First, second and third person are composed of two features, one shared by first and second person, the other shared by second and third person (see Kerstens 1993, Bennis and MacLean 2007, and Aalberse and Don 2010). (iii) Phi-features are organized in a feature geometry (see Gazdar and Pullum 1982 and Harley and Ritter 2002). (iv) Rules that operate on features (rules of impoverishment and spell-out rules) are sensitive to this geometry. We demonstrate that all four assumptions are motivated independently of the typological generalizations concerning the cross-linguistic frequency of patterns of syncretism. We test our proposal through a case study of Dutch agreement. In different circumstances, this language displays syncretism of second and third person, of first and second person, and even of first and third person, and it therefore provides a challenge for any theory aiming to explain person syncretism.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001332/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001332<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Edinburgh/UCL</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syncretism, agreement, person features, feature geometry, impoverishment, dutch, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001332/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2011]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1016 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001332">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001332">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
