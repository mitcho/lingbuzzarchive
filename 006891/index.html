Ontological approaches propose roots fall into semantic classes, such as manner versus result, which determine root distribution (Rappaport Hovav and Levin, 1998; Rappaport Hovav and Levin, 2010). Free distribution approaches, in contrast, hold that root distribution is not constrained by semantic content and roots are free to integrate into various types of event structures (Borer, 2005; Acedo-Matellan and Mateu, 2014). We focus on two different classes of verbs classified as result verbs in Rappaport Hovav and Levin’s (1998; 2010) sense and their ability to appear in resultative constructions. We build on Beavers and Koontz-Garboden’s (2012; 2020) proposal that the roots underlying these verbs fall into two classes: property concept roots, which denote relations between individuals and states, and change-of-state roots, which, on our proposal denote relations between individuals and events of change. We show that change-of-state roots, but not property concept roots, are able to appear in the modifier position of resultative constructions by providing naturally occurring examples of such resultatives. Combining the proposed lexical semantics of these two classes of roots with a reformulation of an ontological approach solely dependent on a root’s semantic type, we show that this analysis makes novel and accurate predictions about the possibility of the two classes of roots appearing in resultative constructions and the range of interpretations available when change-of-state roots are integrated into resultative event structure templates.
