The privative has been the subject of far less cross-linguistic study, meaning that there is little established understanding of how it behaves across languages. This thesis aims to partially fill this gap by presenting a survey of the nominal privative across a sample of 62 Australian languages. This survey examines several core morphosyntactic and semantic elements of the privative.

Firstly, the commonality of privative markers across this sample is recorded, before a more detailed examination of the morphosyntax of these markers. This consists of a survey of their morphological types (suffixes, enclitics, particles, postpositions and independent forms), and the domain marking positions of these markers. This is followed by a taxonomy of entities that can be privative-marked, demonstrating the semantic range of the category.

This thesis also aims to flag several areas in need of further study. These will yield a better understanding of the behaviour of the privative itself, and how it fits into the broader field of Australian negation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006678/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006678<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Monash University, Australia</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>australian languages, privative, negation, typology, nominal morphology, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>260 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006678">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006678">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
