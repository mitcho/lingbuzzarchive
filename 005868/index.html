different sentence types and intonation. A detailed investigation of daroo reveals an interesting paradigm with respect to parameters such as clause type, boundary tone, tier of meaning and pragmatic context. Two naturalness rating studies are conducted to support the predictions regarding the interpretations and felicity of the target sentences. I propose that daroo is a use-conditional speech act operator which asserts the epistemic knowledge of the speaker. The proposal is formally implemented in the framework of inquisitive epistemic logic. That is, daroo marks an assertion of an entertain modality. A rising intonation contour is analyzed as a prosodic morpheme that is paratactically associated to its host and functions as a use-conditional question operator that renders a truth-conditional declarative into a use-conditional interrogative. A new composition rule that instructs how to interpret paratactically associated use-conditional items is also proposed.
