In that paper, we derive basic FC effects by assuming that 'pex' is sensitive to both innocently excludable (IE) and includable (II) alternatives (call this 'pex^IE+II'). This note is intended as an addendum to our main paper: we show that we can derive the same basic results using a purely IE-based presupositional exhaustification operator (call this 'pex^IE'). Relative to the target readings, 'pex^IE+II' and 'pex}^IE' are descriptively on equal footing. Yet there are non-trivial theoretical trade-offs: while the derivation of basic FC effects is simpler with 'pex^IE+II'---in that it doesn't require recursive exhaustification---'pex^IE' uses simpler operations which are sensitive only to IE alternatives. In this note, we present two models to derive FC effects with 'pex^IE': one appeals to a local accommodation operator, and the other on a deeper exploitation of Strong Kleene semantics.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008265/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008265<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>free choice, implicatures, exhaustification, presuppositions, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>390 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008265">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008265">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
