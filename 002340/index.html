We argue that enhanced levels of stuttering are found in function of the complexity of the codas of the immediately preceding word. Complex codas make use of the prosodic space opened up by the subsequent word, more specifically Lowenstamm's CV structure that precedes each word. Stuttered language has stricter licensing conditions on (empty) moras and syllables in general, which becomes directly visible in this leading CV. Various types of stutter, such as consonant prolongation, CV-reduplication, as well as dummy prolonged schwas, follow from this stricter licensing. The fact that this parameter setting has communicative disadvantages, such that it is called a disorder by the WHO, shows that parameter setting in natural language does not necessarily result in possible languages that are functionally equal. The fact that languages variants vary with respect to licensing conditions, locates stuttering at the level of ordinary linguistic micro-variation. Finally, we predict more advance levels of stuttering when recursion is involved. It situates the difference between LWS and LNS in a difference in complexity of Lowenstamm's CV-structure (monomoraic and/or bimoraic words generate it). The monomoraic licensing causes recursion in this phonological structure being monomoraic itself, while bimoraic licensing blocks recursion. This phonological recursion is functionally disadvantageous. We suggest that while recursion in syntax is functionally advantageous (because of its interface with the semantics), recursion in phonology is disadvantageous, but a normal option of UG.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002340/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002340<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>pre-publication</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>stuttering, initial geminates, reduplication, recursion, topic drop, clitics, interfaces, phonology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1552 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002340">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002340">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
