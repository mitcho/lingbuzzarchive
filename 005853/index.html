We document a new challenge to the general validity of CSC, represented by sentences like:<br>
<br>
(1) Ann would not have proposed, had Rita ignored her calls and had forgotten her birthday.<br>
<br>
(2) Should we support Ann and she were to win, she would allow us to drive her Ferrari.<br>
<br>
We call the construction exemplified by the antecedents of (1) and (2) Asymmetric Conditional Inversion (ACI). Assuming that Conditional Inversion involves T-to-C Head Movement (Pesetsky 1989, Iatridou & Embick 1994), we use interpretive evidence to argue that the only viable analysis of ACI sentences is one in which the Auxiliary is T-to-C extracted out of the first conjunct in violation of the CSC, as it is normally stated.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005853/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005853<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>conditional inversion, coordinate structure constraint, head movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005853/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>786 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005853">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005853">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
