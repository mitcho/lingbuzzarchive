She is a speaker with lower competence of her own native language, as is often the case in lesser-used language communities where only a part of the speakers achieve a full competence in the minority language. This puzzling case raises some compelling questions: (i) How pervasive are the effects of incomplete L1 acquisition in adult minority speakers in the specific environment of the small language minorities? (ii) Where can we find the linguistic reasons for incomplete L1 acquisition in minority communities? Are there early signals in the language production of children born in these communities that might allow us to predict, even before they begin school, how their minority language competence will be like, as adults? In this squib I present some preliminary results based on two pilot studies that I carried out with my research group on two German(ic) minority languages in Italy. In addition I discuss future research perspectives.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004040/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004040<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Bollettino dell’Atlante linguistico italiano (BALI) 41, 95-107 </td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>minority languages; cimbrian; mòcheno; low proficiency; semi-speaker; unbalanced bilingualism, ;, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>101 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004040">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004040">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
