However, such prohibitions cannot be learned by positive evidence (an infinite number of well-formed structures are absent from the PLD—we may find a supposed ill-formed structure in the next sentence we encounter). Therefore, these prohibitions could only be learned via negative evidence.
However, it is generally accepted that negative evidence is neither supplied to the child with sufficient regularity, nor attended to by the child when supplied, to play a significant role in language learning. Therefore, since the prohibitions cannot be learned via positive evidence (for reasons of logic), nor through negative evidence (according to the empirical data), they must be innate.
This conclusion follows from the premises, but I believe it is false. The fault lies with the assumption that UG, and also particular grammars, consist of constraints.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004781/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004781<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Rules, constraints, & phonological phenomena, ed.
