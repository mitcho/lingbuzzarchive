in performance has repeatedly returned to longstanding proposals about how
to better understand proficient use of knowledge and how humans acquire it. The following
article takes up an exchange between Chiappe & Gardner (2011) and Barrett
& Kurzban (2012) on the concept of modularity, one of these proposals. Despite the
disagreements expressed, a careful reading of the contributions shows that they also
left us with lines of discussion that will eventually sort out the relevant hypotheses and
integrate findings for future research. These lines of work will contribute to a clearer
understanding of an updated version of the modularity hypothesis that is also compatible
with evolutionary science perspectives on learning. How might the categories of
domain-specific and domain-general correspond to the distinction between competence
and performance and to that of narrow faculty and broad faculty?
