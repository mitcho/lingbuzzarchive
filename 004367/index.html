adjective, one which, in other words, allows the proposition that ‘(a) fake
x is not (an) x’. This study tests the hypothesis that the contexts of an adjective-noun combination are more different from the contexts of the noun when the adjective is such a ‘privative’ one than when it is an ordinary (subsective) one. We here use ‘embeddings’, that is, dense vector representations based on word co-occurrences in a large corpus, which in our study is the entire English Wikipedia as it was in 2013. Comparing the cosine distance between the adjective-noun bigram and single noun embeddings across two sets of adjectives, privative and ordinary ones, we fail to find a noticeable difference. However, we contest that fake is an across-the-board privative adjective, since a fake article, for instance, is most definitely still an article. We extend a recent proposal involving the noun’s qualia roles (how an entity is made, what it consists of, what it is used for, etc.)
and propose several interpretational types of fake-noun combinations, some but
not all of which are privative. These interpretations, which we assign manually to the 100 most frequent fake-noun combinations in the Wikipedia corpus, depend to a large extent on the meaning of the noun, as combinations with similar interpretations tend to involve nouns that are linked in a distributions-based network. When we restrict our focus to the privative uses of fake only, we do detect a slightly enlarged difference between fake + noun bigram and noun distributions compared to the previously obtained average difference between adjective + noun bigram and noun distributions. This result contrasts with negative or even opposite findings reported in the literature.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004367/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004367<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Yearbook of the German Cognitive Linguistics Association 6: 9–42</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantics, fake, privative adjective, modification, distributional semantics, bigram, word and phrase embedding, context-sensitivity</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>261 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004367">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004367">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
