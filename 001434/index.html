English-speaking listeners participated in prominence-rating experiments in which they heard the same production of a simple SVO declarative answer sentence in different focus (i.e., different question) contexts. It was found that when the object was narrowly focused, it was heard as more prominent (and the preceding verb as less prominent)
than when that same object was part of broader VP or Sentence foci. This was true regardless of whether the focus was explicitly contrastive. The results are interpreted as the "top-down" consequence of listeners’ experience-based knowledge about how speakers use prosody to express this information structural contrast.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001434/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001434<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001434">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001434</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>focus, prosody, information structure, perception, prosodic prominence, experimental, semantics, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>333 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001434">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001434">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
