Dingmanse et al. (2013) (DEA) identify two types of such repair initiators. One type is represented by English what, French quoi, Chinese sheme, where the relation between form and meaning is arbitrary. The other type are interjections, such as English huh? and Dutch hèh?. Dingemanse et al. show that these show much less variation: its phonological shape is /(C)v(C)/ with C∈{h, ʔ} and V∈{e, i, ə, .. nonback)} plus a (rising) question intonation. Moreover they show that huh? and its variants are rooted in the phonology of the indiviudal languages: huh? is a word. After rejecting the grunt hypothesis, DEA conclude that huh? and its variants is a universal word. They subsequently attribute this universal pattern to what they call convergent cultural evolution. In this study we show that there is an alternative interpretation of the findings of DEA, one where the invariable characteristics of huh? etc. follow from universal properties of language, i.e. Universal Grammar, and hence are ultimately biological (since UG is coded in the human genome). It is not biological in the sense of grunts, though, since grunts do not fall inside language and therefore are not governed by grammar. Building on what we believe is the central insight of DEA, i.e. the fact that huh? etc. are words and hence governed by grammar, we demonstrate that type one (what etc.) and type two (huh? etc.) repair initiators share core properties and behaviour. These shared properties can only be revealed by linguistic analysis: both what etc. and huh? etc. are embracing structures where a phonetically expressed item in a higher hierarchical position relates to a phonetically unexpressed item of the same kind that occurs lower in the hierarchy. While what etc. exhibit this embracing structure in syntax, in the case of huh? etc. it is manifested in the phonology. The converging phonology of type 2 is a consequence of it. Secondly, we show that, just like type 1 items, there is a grammaticalization pathway of type 2 from other lexical items (greetings), which confirms the language-internal convergence of the type 2 repair initiators.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002499/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002499<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>pre-publication</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>repair initiators, interjections, saussurian arbitrariness, grammaticalization, interrogation, lax-tense opposition, conversation analysis, greetings, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1491 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002499">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002499">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
