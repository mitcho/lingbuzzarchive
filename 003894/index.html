Based on these cases the paper shows that the CSC holds only for successive-cyclic movement, as in *Who did you see [t friends of t] and Sue: elements that are base-generated at the edge of a conjunct, or move there independently of successive-cyclic movement, can extract. It is also shown that ATB can license an additional extraction out of a conjunct in violation of the CSC. The discussion in the paper also leads to establishment of a new type of ATB, where movement out of each conjunct takes place but it is not the same element that is extracted out of each conjunct but different elements. Additionally, the paper shows that unlabeled elements do not count as interveners, a rather natural generalization given the nature of intervention effects, where features of the intervener matter (projecting features requires projecting a label). The discussion in the paper also sheds light on the ban on local wh-movement from SpecTP to SpecCP which is argued to require a return to split IP: it is shown that subjects undergoing wh-movement cannot move to the highest projection in the split IP even when the next step of movement is not SpecCP.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003894/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003894<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>across-the-board movement, coordinate structure constraint, labels, phases, split ip, successive-cyclic movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003894/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>657 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003894">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003894">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
