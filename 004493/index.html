It will be argued that semelfactives are located in the middle of the unergative-unaccusative continuum based on their syntactic behaviour, and that this mixed behaviour can be derived straightforwardly from the semantic characterisation of the verbs in question. A syntactic model is proposed where the arguments of semelfactive verbs have multiple potential (optional) merge locations. The paper corroborates the hypothesis of an unergative-unaccusative continuum that has been mainly examined for certain Indo-European languages and by means of a singe diagnostic (auxiliary selection), by examining a non-Indo-European language and making use of several diagnostics. As far as syntax and semantics of semelfactives in Hungarian is concerned, this model has better empirical coverage than earlier proposals and has more desirable qualities from a theoretical point of view.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004493/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004493<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Surányi, Balázs - Diána Varga (eds.): Proceedings of the First Central European Conference in Linguistics for Postgraduate Students.
