Understanding how language is elaborated in the brain is particularly challenging since different morphological, lexical, and syntactic information are simultaneously conveyed. Disentangling the contribution of each is not an easy challenge. In the present paper we aimed at statistically evaluating the contributions of morphological, lexical and syntactic information in the electrophysiological signal. We recorded EEG responses from 32 participants listening to affirmative active declarative sentences containing homophonous phrases (HPs), constituting either noun phrases (NP) or verb phrases (VP). Using the same acoustic sequences in different syntactic contexts allowed us to avoid the acoustic confounding. Moreover, we controlled the relation between the syntactic and the surprisal information by modulating the predictability of the syntactic structure. We found activations correlating with syntactic and lexical processing in different electrodes, different frequency bands and different time windows, respectively. As expected, only the syntactic surprisal could capture the syntactic neural modulation elicited by the HPs. Using different statistical and computational tools, the present study shows that surprisal models based only on morphological information (category to which a word belongs) are not sufficient: hierarchical models that contain syntactic information are needed to fully characterize the neural activity elicited by our stimuli. Moreover, the temporal dynamics of the NP vs. VP contrast mirrored the expected timing of occurrence of the syntactic processing. Our findings replicated our previous results with SEEG recordings, opening new research and treatment possibilities as EEG is much simpler to record than SEEG, and comes with fewer limitations. Further expanding on the surprisal models, the present paper substantially refines the understanding of the neural correlates of basic syntactic structures such as NPs and VPs by highlighting the sensitivity of the brain to syntactic information and ultimately pave the way to a better understanding of linguistic computation in the brain.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007900/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007900<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under review </td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>surprisal; lexical surprisal; syntactic surprisal; electrophysiological activity; eeg recordings;, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>296 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007900">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007900">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
