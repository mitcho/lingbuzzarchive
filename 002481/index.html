The peculiarity of this construction is that the fronted constituent seems to be repeated in all intermediate clause initial positions. This peculiarity is interesting from a theoretical point of view, as it raises a number of questions regarding the way extraction is implemented in the grammar.
After an inspection of mainly new data from German, the thesis argues first that the term wh-copying is a misnomer. The apparent copies of the fronted constituent are actually independent elements, which however often happen to be homophonous to the fronted constituent. Secondly, it is shown that these independent elements are nevertheless subject to a number of matching constraints requiring partial identity between this element and the fronted constituent.
The theoretical challenge posed by these two results is the tension between them. On the one hand, the repeated element is distinct from the fronted constituent; on the other hand, it has to share some properties with it. The thesis then argues that this tension can be easily resolved if the Arc Pair Grammar framework is adopted. In particular, the way extraction is handled, the treatment of pronouns, and the representation of grammatical relations as syntactic primitives paves the way for a simple analysis of wh-copying in German.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002481/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002481<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Utrecht</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>a'-movement, extraction, wh-copying, successive cyclicity, primitive grammatical relations, german, relation grammar, arc pair grammar, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1525 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002481">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002481">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
