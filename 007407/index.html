The literature, however, has also noted empirical difficulties for the anaphoric approach, and my goal in the present paper is to investigate what happens if we abandon the anaphoric view altogether. Instead of anaphoric felicity conditions, I propose that focus leads to infelicity only indirectly, when the semantic processes that it feeds --- in particular,  exhaustification and question formation --- make an inappropriate contribution to discourse. I outline such an account, in line with Roberts (1996) and incorporating recent insights from Büring (2019) and Fox (2019). This account, which I motivate on conceptual grounds, has no anaphoric  conditions on focus placement and has only an economy condition as a potential felicity condition on focus. However, there are cases where the fine control offered by anaphoricity seems needed, either to block deaccenting that would be licensed by a question or to allow local deaccenting that is not warranted by a question. Such cases challenge non-anaphoric accounts such as the present one and appear to support recent anaphoric proposals such as Schwarzschild (2020), Wagner (2020), and Goodhue (2022). I argue that this potential motivation for anaphoricity is only apparent and that to the extent that anaphoric conditions on focus from the literature are not inert they are in fact harmful.
