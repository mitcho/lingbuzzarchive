number system and algebra. An equation represents the property of
symmetry expressed in the form of symbols, where the equals represents
the axis of symmetry, and the numbers are attached to the
symmetrical halves. At the same time, an equation is a simple declarative
sentence whose main verb is the equals, and which asserts,
I am symmetrical, and It is true that I am symmetrical. Equations
with arithmetical operators are generated on the basis of a dynamically
developing cascade of symmetrical fractal subunits occurring
in successive tiers. Ordinary sentences are generated by modifying
the equation’s symmetrical infrastructure into an asymmetrical configuration,
thus (1) allowing ordinary sentences to accept verbs other
than the equals, and nouns other than numbers, and (2) introducing
syntax by introducing meaning to word order, i.e., a=b and b=a
are the same because equations are symmetrical, while John keeps
bees and Bees keep John are different because ordinary sentences
are asymmetrical. Since only human beings possess language, the
uniquely human property of mind consists of the sense of truthand-
falsity expressed through declarative sentences. The necessity
of discreteness for algebra and language, together with the periodic
nature of the “phoneme” chart and the periodic table of the integers,
suggest that language and algebra represent the quantum property
of matter manifested at a human scale.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001913/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001913<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cognitive Critique 7:49-69 (2013)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>abstract, assertion, discrete, equation, fractal, language, mind, phoneme, sentence, symmetry, syntax, truth, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>536 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001913">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001913">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
