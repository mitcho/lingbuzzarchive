I describe three ways in which pattern recognition studies like that of Fitch and Hauser [2004] and Perruchet and Rey [2005] may fall short of their aim.  Firstly, those studies in fact test only for a domain-general capacity for recursion, rather than for either a capacity for recursion broadly speaking or for a communicative domain-specific capacity.  Thus one reaches Fitch and Hauser's conclusion -- that tamarins lack a capacity for recursion homologous to that of humans -- only if one joins them in their hidden presupposition that humans' unique linguistic abilities evolved as a spandrel, rather than an adaptation for communicative benefit.  Secondly, I explore the ways in which this problem may be intractable; there may be no way to retool a pattern recognition study to test for a communicative domain-specific capacity for recursion.  For if such a capacity is domain-specific, then it may be that the only stimuli that will activate that capacity are already semantically loaded; use of such semantically loaded stimuli would unacceptably infect a study's data with unwanted variables. Finally, I point out a methodological flaw in Fitch and Hauser [2004], which fails to preserve adequate symmetry between its human and nonhuman subjects.  The humans, I suggest, enjoyed enormous advantages over the tamarins that must be neutralized in future comparative pattern recognition studies.  Whereas my first two concerns would merely constrain the use of pattern-recognition data to the study of domain-general recursion, this final concern threatens to render pattern-recognition studies unreliable even in that area.  This methodological concern must be surmounted in future attempts to study syntactic processing ability by way of pattern recognition tasks.  However, even succeeding with respect to this obstacle, such studies must still constrain themselves to searching for domain-general recursion, and are methodologically unsuited to the conclusion that a particular species lacks a capacity for recursion homologous to that of humans.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000725/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000725<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>fln, flb, langauge evolution, recursion, hauser, chomsky, fitch, tamarins, evolution of language, faculty of language in the narrow sense, faculty of language in the broad sense, comparative studies, pattern recognition, evolution of syntax, pattern learning, finite state grammar, chomsky's hierarchy, syntactic cognition, cognition of syntax, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>201 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000725">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000725">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
