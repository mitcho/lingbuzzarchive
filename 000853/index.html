Furthermore, it has three matrix elocutionary force particles which have similar, but more subtle properties. Two of these particles also manifest agreement. This paper describes all of these complementisers and particles. Demirdache (1988, unpublished) provides elements of a case-based analysis in which inn assigns accusative case. While Egyptian Arabic does not have morphological case, the fact that the Classical Arabic counterpart of this complementiser does assign morphologically visible accusative case makes such an analysis attractive. The plausibility of a case-based analysis is explored by testing the case properties of different types of DPs, such as independent pronouns, clitics, and pro. Among the issues discussed are an ECM construction and the doubling of a preverbal pro with an overt DP. An alternative analysis is also sketched whereby the complementiser has a weak EPP feature. Both analyses are shown to give an incoherent case characterisation of some type of DP. The case analysis does not allow us to maintain that independent pronouns are always nominative, while the EPP analysis does not allow us to maintain that pronominal clitics are never nominative.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000853/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000853<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>unpublished</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>arabic, complementizers, elocutionary force particles, case, pro, epp, clitics, pronouns, ecm, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>208 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000853">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000853">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
