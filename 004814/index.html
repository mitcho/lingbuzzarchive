This paper explores the crosslinguistic variation in such constraints, starting with several closely-related Zapotec varieties. These restrict combinations of clitics based not just on person, but also on a finely articulated largely animacy-based gender system. Operating within a larger combinatorial space, these constraints offer a new perspective on the typology of Phi–Case Constraints (ΦCCs) more generally. This typology has an overall asymmetrical shape correlating with the underlying syntactic position of pronominal arguments. We develop a principled theory of this typology that incorporates three hypotheses: (i) ΦCCs arise from how a functional head Agrees with clitic pronouns, subject to intervention-based locality (Anagnostopoulou 2003, Béjar and Rezac 2003, 2009); (ii) the variation in these constraints arises from variation in the relativization of probes (Anagnostopoulou 2005, Nevins 2007, 2011); and, (iii) clitic and other weak pronouns have no inherent need to be licensed via Agree with a functional head. Under this account, the crosslinguistic typology of ΦCCs has the potential to shed light on the grammatical representation of person and gender.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004814/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004814<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Linguistic Inquiry</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pronouns, agreement, agree, person, animacy, gender, number, movement, clitics, locality, intervention, person-case constraint, person, animacy, gender, number, phi-features, zapotec, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004814/v2.pdf">v2 [November 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004814/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>583 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004814">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004814">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
