In previous accounts the occurrence of the PP is viewed as lexical idiosyncrasy, reflecting either the verbs inability to assign (check) Case (Hestvik 1991) or its thematic deficiency (Neeleman 1997). I argue instead that the phenomenon is not arbitrary, and that the occurrence of the PP has a principled reason. Specifically, assuming the framework of the Theta System (Reinhart 2002), I argue that PP-verbs are two-place predicates whose internal è-role is underspecified, rendering them incapable of Case-checking; their prepositions check structurally the Case of the verbs internal DP argument. The proposal is supported by empirical evidence showing that the underspecified è-roles are systematically distinguishable from the fully specified ones, and that the Ps of PP-verbs are not inherent Case assigners. Finally, based on the comparison between the group of PP-verbs in Hebrew and their counterparts in English and Russian, some specific sources for the observed cross-linguistic variation are suggested.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000521/current.doc">doc</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000521<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>underspecified theta-roles, case checking, the theta system, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000521/v1.doc">v1 [September 2007]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>263 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000521">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000521">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
