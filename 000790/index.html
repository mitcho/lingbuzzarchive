the past through quantifier raising, which leaves a trace of type <e> to combine with

verbs where a quantifier phrase of type <<e,t>,t> cannot. With more and more evidence

emerging in support of the copy theory of movement, the issue emerges of how to treat

quantifiers. Current research proposes that quantifier phrases leave copies in the syntax

but convert into a trace for semantic interpretation. I show that such conversion is

unnecessary and that quantifier phrases can be interpreted by semantics as full copies.

Sauerland proposed that full copies of moved quantifier phrases exist in syntax

but that the quantifier phrase must undergo a transformation to become something more

like a trace to be interpreted semantically, a method accepted and later formalized by Fox

and incorporated into current research by Takahashi.

All of these researchers left unnoticed work previously set forth by Kratzer, which

provides a new semantic model that I call the Event Model. This model is a semantic

counterpart to VP shells, incorporating proposals put forth by Larson, Hale and Keyser,

McIntyre, and others. Kratzer specifies a new single semantic type for all verbs, a new

node called Voice to attract an external argument, and a shell structure that parallels VP

shells in syntax.

I show in this paper that Kratzers model allows quantifier phrases to combine

directly with verbs in subject and object positions. I utilize a new semantic type for

quantifier phrases that she describes in later research, and I explain how they combine

with verbs. I then show how full copies of quantifier phrases and verbs can occupy

different positions in the syntactic tree and that they can be interpreted in the semantic

interface without requiring traces in order to resolve type mismatches. Last, I confirm

that my proposal does not cause problems for scope interpretation. Using works of Fox,

Takahashi, McCarthy, and Aoun and Li, I develop a model that allows the syntax to

delete copies of moves quantifier phrases from interpretation and allows the semantic

interface to interpret the remaining quantifier phrases for scope relation, and I formalize a

rule for that model.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000790/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000790<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Utah</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>copy theory event quantifier semantics syntax minimalist minimalism kratzer, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>277 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000790">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000790">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
