In this paper we examine the use of loshn koydesh elements among 26 native speakers of contemporary Hasidic Yiddish consisting of two subgroups a) 10 Israeli Hasidic Yiddish speakers, for whom Modern Hebrew is a majority co-territorial language, and b) 12 New York Hasidic Yiddish speakers alongside a small group of 4 London Hasidic Yiddish speakers, for whom English is a majority co-territorial language. Participants were given a written questionnaire with tasks examining three issues: 1) the gender of Hebrew/Aramaic nouns; 2) periphrastic verbs with a Hebrew/Aramaic element; and 3) adjectives derived from the loshn koydesh element of periphrastics. The paper has two aims, namely a) to ascertain whether contact with Modern Hebrew and English has resulted in differences in these speakers’ use of the loshn koydesh element of Yiddish, and b) whether there are differences between male and female speakers. Our findings show that there are marked differences on both the geographical and gender axes, many of which are consistent with the speakers' varied exposure to Modern Hebrew, English, and loshn koydesh. We also found that the loshn koydesh component has developed since the pre-War stage of the language and that some of these grammatical changes seem to effect contemporary Hasidic Yiddish usage in all locations and for both genders. We take these developments to provide evidence for the existence of this newly emergent variety of Yiddish – Contemporary Hasidic Yiddish. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005511/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005511<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under review at Journal of Jewish Languages</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>yiddish, morphological gender, language contact, determiners, adjective, periphrastic, verb, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>434 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005511">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005511">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
