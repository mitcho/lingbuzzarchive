An ongoing debate concerns the possibility of attributing this variation to features in functional projections. The so-called Borer-Chomsky conjecture as formulated by Mark Baker (2008) states that all parameters of variation are attributable to differences in the features of particular items (e.g. functional heads) in the lexicon. This statement is explored in depth here. It is shown that not only macrovariation, but also microvariation can be encoded in the featural setup of a functional head. Specifically, the position in which features appear will be shown to determine a substantial amount of the microvariation that we observe in dialects, while microvariation can be determined by the specification of the feature as valued or unvalued. The case study concerns a group of dialects spoken in Southern Italy that present noticeable microvariation. These dialects will be shown to differ from the other macrogroup of northern Italian dialects purely as a result of the locus of an extra functional head. They also differ minimally from split ergative languages because of the valued/unvalued nature of the features found on this extra head.
It will specifically be demonstrated that the almost perfect complementary distribution between languages with subject clitics and languages with person-driven auxiliary selection is not accidental, but is the logical result of the presence of an extra φ-probe doubling the features of the subject in different parts of the syntactic spine.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001771/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001771<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>probes; auxiliary selection; person splits; microvariation; subject clitics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>357 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001771">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001771">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
