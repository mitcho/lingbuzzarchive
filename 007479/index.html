Two primary questions guiding this investigation are: (1) what properties do resumptive Ā-dependencies share with gapped Ā-dependencies and/or with base-generated binding dependencies; and (2) what properties do resumptive pronouns share with non-resumptive pronouns? The answers I provide to these questions are based on the most systematic investigation of connectivity and cyclicity effects under resumption to date, drawing both on novel data and on a broad survey of the previous literature.

Regarding (1), I argue that two kinds of resumptive Ā-dependencies can be distinguished---those which behave like movement-derived dependencies, patterning with gaps (e.g. in Spanish), and those which behave like base-generated binding dependencies (e.g. in Arabic). The diagnostics which reliably distinguish the two types of resumptives and which march in lockstep cross-linguistically are morphophonological reflexes of movement, island-sensitivity, parasitic gap licensing, exactly stranding, and case-connectivity. A key corollary of my analysis is that natural language syntax must be able to differentiate between (External) Merge and Move (qua Internal Merge). To account for this distinction, I argue for a feature-driven approach to structure-building operations, as opposed to free (or untriggered) approaches. I adduce additional support in favor of the feature-driven approach coming from variation in the construction of long-distance dependencies, specifically with mixed chains. 

Regarding (2), I provide a battery of novel tests showing that resumptive pronouns behave morphologically, semantically, and syntactically like regular pronouns (Doron, 1982; Engdahl, 1982; McCloskey, 2002; Asudeh, 2004), regardless of whether or not the operator that binds them moves. Crucially, certain properties which have previously been taken to motivate a movement analysis of resumption are shown to not march in lockstep with the aforementioned movement diagnostics: these are reconstruction effects and crossover effects. I contend that neither reconstruction nor crossover strictly correlates with movement, contra much previous literature, and I show that both are robustly attested with base-generated resumptive dependencies. Instead, independent structural properties of pronouns and general constraints on variable binding, respectively, predict the presence of both reconstruction and crossover under resumption. Additionally, I argue that the pronominal regularity of movement-derived resumptives (e.g. in Spanish) supports a stranding approach to such resumption, wherein resumptive pronouns double Ā-moved operators which bind them, over and against ‘spelled-out trace’ approaches which face significant hurdles in explaining all the relevant facts. 

This dissertation thus defends a pluralistic view of resumptive Ā-dependencies couched within a feature-driven approach to structure-building while nevertheless accounting for cross-linguistically stable properties of (resumptive) pronouns.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007479/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007479<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>The University of Chicago Dissertation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>Ā-dependencies, resumption, base-generation, movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>177 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007479">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007479">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
