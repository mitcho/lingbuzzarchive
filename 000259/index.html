While the former is closely associated with stratal effects that rely on the existence of different classes of affixes, the latter translates phonologically relevant morpho-syntactic structure into a phonological arborescence that is known as the Prosodic Hierarchy.  The Prosodic Hierarchy to date stands unchallenged and is the theory-resident default when phonologists make reference to extra-phonological information. This has not changed in constraint-based environments which have taken over prosodic constituency with minor adaptations (e.g. Selkirk 2000, Kiparsky 2000, Bermúdez-Otero forth).

<br>This article shows that the Prosodic Hierarchy is as much a diacritic as classical SPE-type boundaries (#, +), if an autosegmental one. Everybody today agrees that diacritics are non-linguistic objects and hence cannot be part of linguistic theory. This line of argumentation has contributed to outlaw # and the like; it is argued here that the Prosodic Hierarchy must be abandoned for the same reason.

<br>A crucial advance made by Prosodic Phonology is the principle known as Indirect Reference according to which phonology cannot directly access morpho-syntactic structure and hence may not mention morpho-syntactic categories in the structural description of rules (or in constraints). The critical argument for Indirect Reference which is repeated over and over again in the literature is so-called non-isomorphism: the domain of the string which is phonologically relevant does not necessarily coincide with any morpho-syntactic constituent. Therefore, Prosodic Phonology argues, there must be a translating process whereby a Translator's Office  which is neither part of morpho-syntax nor of phonology  maps morpho-syntactic structure onto prosodic structure. While the Translator's Office takes morpho-syntactic structure as an input, it modifies it according to its own standards  thereby making it non-isomorphic  before handing it over to phonology in the coat of the Prosodic Hierarchy.

<br>The article argues that Prosodic Phonology has reached exactly the right conclusion  but for the wrong reason: non-isomorphism is a mirage that is created by analysis, not by linguistic fact; it appears when one looks at the data through a prism that imposes domains, rather than boundaries. Non-isomorphism evaporates as soon as the same data are interpreted in terms of the latter. On the other hand, a good reason for the existence of the Translator's Office is modularity: different modules do not speak the same language (of the brain, e.g. Jackendoff 1992 et passim), and hence can only communicate through a no-man's land-based translation.

<br>If the Prosodic Hierarchy thus is a domain-created mirage and boundaries turn out to be the correct interface currency, we seem to be requesting a self-contradicting theory, i.e. one where extra-phonological information is represented as non-diacritic boundaries. The article shows that this term does not need to be self-contradictory: its paradoxical flavour stems from the fact that the two essential properties of what is commonly called a "boundary" have never been distinguished. That is, boundaries are 1) local and 2) diacritic. The former seems to imply the latter  and this is exactly what is not true: there may well be non-diacritic boundaries. In other words, when boundaries were eliminated from phonological theory, the local baby was thrown out with the diacritic bath.

<br>Hence the article proposes a theory where interface information is handed down locally  in the sense of what is traditionally called sandhi; yet the output of the Translator's Office are only truly phonological objects. A truly phonological object is one that exists in domestic phonology anyway and in absence of any interface-related issue. The result is Direct Interface, i.e. a theory where higher level information does not transit through a diacritic. A welcome effect of this is that different phonological theories, which of course have different domestic vocabulary, make different predictions as to what can be the output of the Translator's Office: only their domestic vocabulary is eligible as the output of the Translator's Office. Therefore, Direct Interface allows for evaluating phonological theories according to their behaviour at the interface  a new perspective.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000259/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000259<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>interface, diacritics, prosodic hierarchy, direct interface, prosodic phonology, lexical phonology, derivationalism in phonology, syntax, phonology, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>219 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000259">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000259">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
