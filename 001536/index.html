However, it has also often been reported that languages can sometimes distinguish more than three tenses (Comrie 1985, Dahl 1985, Bybee et al. 1994). Such languages appear to have ‘graded tense’ systems, where the tense morphology serves to track how far into the past or future a reported event occurs. This paper presents a formal semantic analysis of the tense-aspect system of Gĩkũyũ (Kikuyu), a Northeastern Bantu language of Kenya. Like many languages of the Bantu family, Gĩkũyũ appears to exhibit a graded tense system, wherein four grades of past tense and three grades of future tense are distinguished. However, I argue that the prefixes traditionally labeled as ‘tenses’ in Gĩkũyũ exhibit important differences from (and similarities to) tenses in languages like English. I will defend the hypothesis that, like tenses in English, these ‘temporal remoteness prefixes’ in Gĩkũyũ introduce presuppositions regarding a temporal parameter of the clause. However, unlike English tenses, these presuppositions concern the ‘Event Time’ of the clause directly, and not the ‘Topic Time’. Consequently, the key difference between Gĩkũyũ and languages like English lies not in how many tenses are distinguished, but in whether tense-like features are able to modify other, lower verbal functional projections in the clause.
