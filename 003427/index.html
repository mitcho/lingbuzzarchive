But the syntactic objects constructed by Set Merge (Chomsky 2001 et seq) fit much closer with trees recursively defined in computer science. In this paper I consider how syntactic trees as such can be recursively linearized with tree traversal/walk algorithm familiar in computer science. I show that for tree walk to be applicable to an inherently unordered syntactic tree, an asymmetry has to be established between the two subtrees of a parent tree, so that the latter may be unambiguously co-labeled with exactly one of its subtrees. In modifying Chomsky’s (2013, 2015) labeling algorithm to serve the purpose, I discuss the implications the label-based linearization theory has for the labeling algorithm itself and for the syntactic phenomena it has been used to account for. The theory thus provides a direct support in favor of the SMT (Chomsky 2001 et seq) that the properties of syntactic computation are largely determined by interface conditions.
