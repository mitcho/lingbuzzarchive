How come, for example, that, if we take a sentence like:
(1)	You must not swallow the cherry-stone, my dear!
the interpretation of this sentence will be that it is necessary (for you) not to swallow the cherry-stone, with modality (necessity) scoping above negation, while, from a syntactic point of view, the negative marker not  seems to negate the modal verb (since it allegedly passes all Klima’s tests for negativity (1964))? How can we explain the divergence between syntax and semantics? Can we truly accept the idea that, although the negative operator syntactically negates the modal verb, it does not do so from a semantic point of view? If so, what becomes of one of the ideas which has been at the very  heart of generative grammar, namely, that the interpretation of a sentence is read off from its syntax, in other words,  that syntax is a mirror of semantics? 
	The case presented above involves the divergence between semantics and syntax in the case of a modal verb receiving a particular reading (deontic). Interestingly, such a divergence only occurs in the case of some modal verbs. In the case of a verb like may, under  a deontic reading, for example,  there is no such divergence. A sentence like:
(2)	You may not buy that blue-haired teddy-bear! Annie says so.
is clearly interpreted as ‘You are not allowed to buy that blue-haired teddy-bear’/ ‘It is not permitted that you buy that blue-haired teddy-bear’, with negation scoping above modality (possibility (permission)), which fares well with the fact that negation syntactically negates the modal verb. 
Moreover, some modal verbs scope differently with respect to negation  according to whether they receive a deontic or epistemic interpretation. Such is the case of may. If it receives a deontic interpretation, it will scope above negation (2). If, however, it receives an epistemic interpretation, it will scope below negation. In a sentence like:
(3)	Linda may not have spent too much time reading lately.
the interpretation is that ‘It is possible that Linda has not spent too much time reading lately’, where negation scopes below modality.  Despite this, it is not the case that all modals behave in such a fashion. A verb like should, for example, will not be sensitive to the deontic-epistemic contrast in the same way as may. Sentences like:
(4) a. You should not talk dirty to the parrot! He might surprise you one of these days!
      b. Linda should not be very sad to be married to such a rich man.
receive interpretations in which negation scopes below modality (necessity), although  (4a) receives a deontic reading, while (4 b) receives an epistemic reading. 
	As it stands, modal verbs seem to behave in a non-unitary fashion with respect to negation. In some cases, the syntax of modal verbs and negation seems to reflect their semantics, in others, it seems not to. Some modals seem to change their behaviour with respect to negation according to whether they receive a deontic or an epistemic interpretation, others do not. Not even the necessity-possibility contrast is able to capture the different behaviour of modals with respect to negation. How are we, then,  to make sense of all these oddities?
	The aim of our paper is to try to offer an answer to this question. In doing so, it starts from the very strange behaviour of modals in general, trying to see in what way linguists have managed to account for contrasts such as the necessity-possibility contrast, or the deontic-epistemic contrast. 
 	The paper is divided into two parts. In the first part, we deal with modal verbs, discussing their status as a distinct morpho-syntactic class, discussing their semantic properties, and presenting the various syntactic  proposals put forth by linguists in order to account for the odd behaviour of modals. In the second part, we deal with negation and modals in English. We first present the way in which modals behave with respect to negation, according to the traditional view. Afterwards, we put forth our own hypothesis, claiming that many of the ‘misplacements’ of the negative marker with respect to modals in English are but the result of  ill usage on the part of the speaker, and/ or of  misinterpretation on the part of the hearer. On our view, neither the necessity-possibility contrast, nor the deontic-epistemic contrast can account for the different behaviour of modals with respect to negation, at least not in the sense in which linguists such as Cormack & Smith (2002) or Butler (2003) have claimed. Since the idea that there is a divergence between semantics and syntax in the case of some modals is a completely unacceptable idea,  syntacticians have tried to make syntax fit semantics, and, in their attempt to save the idea that syntax is a mirror of semantics, they have resorted to an extremely complicated syntactic machinery so as to account for the behaviour of modals with respect to negation. A more appealing alternative to this is to claim that the blame for irregularity  does not rest with the extremely complex system of modals and negation in English, but with those making use of language. On such a view, English is just as regular as any other language, since negation of the MoodP results in negation of modality, and negation of the VP results in negation of the complement of the modal.  Many of the odd interpretations given to sentences containing modals and negation spring from the ambiguity between sentence negation (negation of the modal) and adverbial negation (negation of the lexical verb).  Such a distinction proves crucial in explaining the interpretation of modals with respect to negation. At the end of the paper, after showing in what way the syntactic proposals put forth by Picallo (1990), Ouhalla (1991), Cormack & Smith (2002), Butler (2003) fail to account for the behaviour of modals with respect to negation, we tentatively offer our own syntactic representation of modals and negation. According to us, all modal verbs occur under one single head (MoodP), and the different interpretations offered to modals (deontic-epistemic) are a result of the interplay between semantics and pragmatics. The interpretation offered to sentences containing modals and negation is read off from their syntax. If we are dealing with a negative marker which is an instance of NegP (occurring above the MoodP), then negation will semantically scope above modality. If, however, we are dealing with a negative marker which is an instance of adverbial negation (occurring below MoodP and above VP), then negation will semantically scope below modality. In this way, we can avoid the idea of a  mismatch between syntax and semantics. On our view, such a syntactic representation, coupled with a pragmatic account of the oddities in English, can capture the behaviour of modals with respect to negation in English.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003424/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003424<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>unpublished (BA Thesis)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>modality, negation, scope, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3315 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003424">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003424">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
