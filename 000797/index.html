The shipping back and forth of pieces between (morpho-)syntax and the PF/LF interfaces during the derivation of a sentence establishes a pipe between the concatenative and the interpretational devices that did not exist in GB or earlier versions of the inverted T-/Y-architecture. It creates a situation where syntactic theories and analyses may have direct consequences on the phonological side, and vice versa.

I submit that intermodular argumentation provides stronger evidence than what can be produced by modular-internal reasoning: it offers the maximal degree of independent assessment that linguists can expect without leaving their discipline. Be it only for that reason, the new interactionist architecture that the minimalist orientation has installed is a good thing to have: after a long period of quasi-silence, syntacticians and phonologists can talk again about things not concerning the weather or job openings. This is one goal of the paper, which will be briefly illustrated by two case studies where syntax can be argued to act as a referee for competing phonological theories (the PIC and the phase edge).

The other goal is to make the conditions of intermodular argumentation explicit: what it can do, want it cannot do, and what it can do only if this or that question is settled beforehand. As far as I can see, much of the intermodular refereeing potential unfortunately hinges on a question that is subject to much ongoing debate: whether morphology is just the lower part of syntax, or whether it is a computational system in its own right that builds hierarchical structure which is distinct from syntactic structure. Depending on this question is the number of spell-out mechanisms that exist in grammar, which, as we will see, is critical for the comparison of phonological and syntactic effects of cyclic spell-out. That is, if it turns out that morphology and syntax are two distinct computational systems, it could be argued with some right that each system comes with its own spell-out mechanism. Note, however, that this is not a necessary conclusion: two distinct structures may as well be 'harvested' by the same mechanism. On the other hand, in case morphology and syntax are found to be emanations of one and the same computational system, there is of course no room for two distinct spell-out mechanisms.

The reason why the number of spell-out mechanisms matters is a massive empirical asymmetry that has been encoded in phonological theories of the interface without, however, having been made explicit as such. I call this phenomenon the word-spell-out-mystery which  in a nutshell  is about the absence of phonological effects of the cyclic spell-out of words and larger chunks (against the plethoric phonological traces of the cyclic spell-out of morphemes). There is no good reason for this asymmetry: nobody doubts that spell-out itself is cyclic  whatever the size of the chunks in question. Why, then, should an interpretational system (phonology) be sometimes impacted by the cyclic (wave )structure of what it receives, but at other times simply ignore it? The null hypothesis is certainly that cyclic chunk-submission will leave traces in whatever (system) is exposed to its piecemeal fire. On this count, sub-word phonology is normal, but word phonology is weird.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000797/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000797<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Explorations of Phase Theory: Interpretation at the Interfaces, edited by Kleanthes Grohmann.
