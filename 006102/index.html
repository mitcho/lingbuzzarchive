The observation is that only and even express some sort of ‘scalar antonymy’, and it is illustrated in (1):
(1) 	(Context: We are arriving late to a committee meeting evaluating John’s and Bill’s achievements, and manage to hear what one of the committee members says about Bill):
a.. …and during the last 3 years he only wrote [3]F papers. (5 is ‘a little’)
			b. …and during the last 3 years he  even wrote [5]F papers . (5 is ‘a lot’)
I examine three schematic suggestions which did try to capture the scalar antonymy of only and even, namely that only vs. even presuppose that their prejacent, p is lower vs. higher (respectively), (a) than what is expected /  what is the default standard in the context (the ‘mirative / evaluative antonymy’ view), (b) than some (salient) alternative in the set of contextually relevant focus alternatives, C, (the ‘existential antonymy’ view), or (c) than all alternatives in C (the ‘superlative antonymy’ view). The differences between these views are often subtle, and in many contexts the predictions they make empirically overlap. One goal of the paper, then, is to examine the felicity and interpretation of only and even in a wider range of contexts than has been done so far, so we end up with  better diagnostics for teasing apart the predictions of each of these view. A second goal is to argue that this examination supports the preferability of the ‘superlative’ view over the ‘existential’ and the ‘mirative / evaluative’ views, and to discuss ways to handle issues which were raised against this view. Finally, I hope to discuss potential implications and open questions raised by the examination of the scalar antonymy of only and even regarding the way contextual factors affect the construction of sets of alternatives, and compare them to parallel implications and questions raised in experimental studies on activation  / processing of alternatives and in research on Scalar Implicatures.
