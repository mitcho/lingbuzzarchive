At the time that this was published, I felt that grammar should affect culture rather than the other way around. However, since abandoning the idea of "parametrization" in grammars (as well as Chomskyanism in general) and through incorporating what is known about tense with other aspects of Pirahã grammar, it has become clear that it is culture affecting grammar that is most significant in Pirahã, rather than the other way around (wrt tense). This paper assumed a Hornsteinian interpretation of Reichenbach's classic work on tense, but parameterized so as to omit the "R" point. In current work I am incorporating this into a wider theory of temporal semantics based on Peircean semiosis. I am posting this article on LingBuzz at the moment because the facts are interesting for theories of temporal representation and interpretation in language.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005062/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005062<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Pragmatics and Cognition 1:1 (1993)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>tense, reichenbach, sapir, culture, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>187 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005062">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005062">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
