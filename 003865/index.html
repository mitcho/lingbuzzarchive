The key for understanding this hybrid status is to be found in development, for when individually evolving, a general dynamic is observed in which organism-internal facilities selectively apply to certain designated aspects of the environmental stimulus, which in their turn have a facilitatory impact on these very same facilities. These kinds of loops inspire the conclusion that the internal and the external compose a single, integrated developmental unit.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003865/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003865<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Glossa: a journal of general linguistics 3(1): 22. 1–33, DOI: https://doi.org/10.5334/gjgl.330</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>i-language, e-language, developmental hybrids, language development, biolinguistics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>128 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003865">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003865">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
