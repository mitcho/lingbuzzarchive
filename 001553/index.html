It is argued that there is a class of semantically vacuous functional heads – linkers – serving only as a syntactic means of marking subordination and coordination relationships.  Through studying restrictions on the structural and linear distribution of linkers cross-linguistically, the thesis sheds light on varied areas of syntax: projection in morphology and syntax; word order; and the place of coordination within phrase-structure.

The morphosyntax provides two mechanisms for marking a grammatical relationship.  An affix can mark the relationship by attaching directly to any member of the relationship.  Alternatively, the relationship can be marked by a syntactically independent semantically vacuous functional head (a linker) structurally intervening between members of the relationship.  Combined with principles of extended projection, this leads to the restriction that, in marking a subordination relationship, linkers invariably form a constituent with the Dependent.  This prediction is verified using linkers predominantly in the complex noun phrase.

We next consider how the structural distribution of linkers is mapped onto linear order.  It is proposed that natural language makes available two types of linearisation constraint: a universal ranking of constraints relating to harmony; and constraints referring to specific features of a head – either lexical category or features encoding semantics.  Given their status as semantically vacuous functional heads, only the first type of linearisation constraint, relating to harmony, applies to linkers.  It is shown that this theory successfully accounts for the cross-linguistic absence of certain disharmonic word orders.

Finally, we consider the implications of the restrictions on the structural and linear distribution of linkers for the marking of coordination.  It is argued that coordination is a symmetric structure, headed by two or more coordinands.  Any difference in the distribution of coordinating and subordinating linkers is attributed to the unique syntax of coordination.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001553/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001553<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD dissertation, UCL</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>linkers, dependency-marking, subordination, coordination, coordinators, typology, extended projection, linearisation, linearization, word order, optimality theory, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3628 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001553">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001553">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
