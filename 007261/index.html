This essay reviews what is known about the traditional Smyrna dialect from dialectological sources and compares them to materials from what is arguably the first grammar devoted entirely to what is now regarded as Standard Western Armenian, the K'erakanut'iwn Angghiarën ev Hayerën (English and Armenian Grammar) published anonymously in Smyma/lzmir in 1835. This is one of the earliest attempts to standardize Modem Armenian, though in a form noticeably closer to the spoken language of the region than what survives in the standard language today. Regional forms such as իրեք irek' “3”; տասնըւինը dasnəvinə “19”; քսանւերկու k'əsanvergu “22”; and նիստ nist “sit!” abound, as well as forms of Turkish origin such as ջաթալ ʧ'at'al “fork” excised from the standard language following the Armenian Genocide.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007261/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007261<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Armenian Smyrna/Izmir, Volume 11 in the series Historic Armenian Cities and Provinces, edited by Richard G.
