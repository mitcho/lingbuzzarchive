I argue that quotes are essentially modal operators that shift the model of interpretation from the actual to an unactualised yet accessible one. This approach is supported by two observations. First, I present novel data from overt modals which, when taking scope over quotational expressions (QEs), obtain a special reading providing possible languages. Second, I argue that the account of QEs according to which the interpretation of quoted expressions is relativised to the quoted source (Maier 2014a, a.o.) must be extended in order to capture this effect. A natural solution comes from adapting this general approach to the modal account of reported speech presented by Kratzer (2013, 2016). The proposed modal framework captures mixed, pure and direct QEs, appearing with and without overt modals. Accordingly, it shows that quotation, as well as the whole reported speech, is part of modality and does not require dedicated mechanisms.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005324/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005324<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>quotation, enquotation, direct discourse, modality, reportative modals, model shifting, i-language, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005324/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>638 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005324">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005324">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
