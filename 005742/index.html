Preminger (2019a) argues that the Anaphor Agreement Effect (AAE) (Rizzi 1990, Woolford 1999) shows that what he refers to as binding-as-agreement is untenable. In this commentary I show that it is crucial to distinguish between a claim that all binding is mediated by Agree  (full reductionism) and the modular approach in Reuland (2011) and subsequent work, where it is argued that binding of φ-deficient anaphors is mediated by Agree. In general, Preminger's arguments against full reductionism are sound. However they don't carry over to an approach in which binding of φ-deficient anaphors is mediated by Agree. The timing of valuing and visibility for the AAE/spell-out is a potential problem for such an approach, but only in so far as 'anaphoricity' is not preserved. In an approach along the lines of Zubkov (2018) this issue is resolved. 
	Preminger offers an explanation of the AAE in Basque based on the existence of an outer layer in complex anaphors. However, there is no evidence for an outer layer in SE-anaphors such as Icelandic sig, Dutch zich, etc. Consequently, Preminger's explanation of the AAE in Basque cannot be generalized to all cases of the AAE.
