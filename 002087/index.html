This seems to contradict the general observation that abstract morphology typically is not subject to borrowing. We discuss the status of two Serbo-Croatian (S-C) nominalizing Latinate suffixes, -cija and -itet, which display relatively high values of productivity and frequency. On our analysis, these are not borrowed suffixes and derivational patterns, in the sense that they were present in another language and got copied into S-C, but rather suffixes and patterns which emerged within S-C, more specifically in the Latinate stratum of the S-C lexicon. In other words, we argue that members of these two classes of nominalizations were first borrowed as simplex words.  After demonstrating that the sequences -cija and -itet display quantitative patterns characteristic of the productive native suffixes, we argue that these quantitative effects, in conspiracy with the shared semantic properties of the nouns ending in these sequences, have led to a reanalysis of the initial simplex borrowed forms as derived nouns involving a stem and the suffix -cija or -itet, respectively. Pragmatic, phonotactic and prosodic constraints apply to these derivations to the effect that the suffixes that have emerged in the borrowed domain of the lexicon never enter a competition with the native nominalization patterns.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002087/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002087<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>SinFoniJA 6 (submitted)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>latinate nominalizations, borrowing, paradigms, serbo-croatian, quantitative analysis, productivity, syntax, phonology, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1052 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002087">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002087">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
