Marathi contain a discourse clitic whose uses overlap with those of English particles like exclusives only/just, intensifiers really/totally, precisifiers right/exactly/absolutely, anaphoric indeed/that very, and scalar additive even without corresponding perfectly to any of them. This paper offers an analysis of the varied and seemingly disparate uses of this particle, focusing on the Marathi variant =ts. I claim that =ts conventionally signals that interlocutors are in mutual agreement that the proposition denoted by the prejacent is uniquely salient among alternatives in the current question. That is, =ts conveys that the proposition expressed by the prejacent offers a schelling point
(or focal point) for the interlocutors to coordinate on. Most effects associated with =ts are shown to arise as a consequence of pragmatic reasoning about the position of the prejacent with respect to the contextually given ordering on the current question. In addition to offering a unified analysis for Marathi =ts and its functional cognates in Indo-Aryan, this new perspective can open the door to a better understanding of why exclusivity, mirativity, precisification, and intensification might cluster together in languages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006578/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006578<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>discourse particles, formal pragmatics, current question, indo-aryan, exclusives, miratives, precisifiers, intensifiers, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>298 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006578">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006578">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
