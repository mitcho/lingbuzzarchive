Focus is given to the question as to whether CP-layer has any role on phi-feature checking in Turkish. The verbs agreement marker in Turkish agrees in the Nominative Subjects phi-features. However, in partitive quantifiers, there are two distinct options on the verbs agreement marker: one agrees with whole DPs phi-feature (singular agreement) and other is in agreement with the possessive phi-feature in DP (plural agreement). Singular agreement occurs with partitive quantifiers as subjects in nominalized clauses and possessive NPs, whereas plural agreement occurs only in root clauses and indicative adjunct clauses in Turkish. I argued that Maximal Operator pro inside the partitive quantifier structure moves to [Spec,CP], if there is an accessible non-defective C, namely a C head that bear a complete phi-probe. As a result of this movement, plural agreement with partitive quantifiers occurs in Turkish. Therefore, it could be claimed that the agreement feature gets merged on C at least in root and indicative adjunct clauses in Turkish.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000816/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000816<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ankara University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agreement, multiple nominative, partitive quantifier, turkish, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000816/v2.pdf">v2 [August 2008]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000816/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2008]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>404 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000816">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000816">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
