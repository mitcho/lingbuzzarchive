This a priori unexpected semantic similarity between structures with negation in the complement clause and those with it in the main clause, found in many other languages as well, has been the subject of a great deal of work. Beginning with Fillmore (1963), within the generative grammar tradition, there developed in the 1960s and 1970s considerable agreement that the roughly equivalent reading of pairs like (1a, b) was a function of a syntactic phenomenon of negation raising (dubbed Classical NEG-Raising), from the complement into the main clause. That is, the shared reading was taken to be associated with cases like (1a) because the main clause NEG originates in the complement clause and is raised into the main clause. 

While popular at the earlier period, not so long after Fillmore’s (1963) article, acceptance of a syntactic approach to Classical NR began to erode. Over time, purely semantic or pragmatic approaches appear to have become increasingly favored and our impression is that such views are dominant today.

In this work, we discuss several sorts of data that are difficult for a semantic/pragmatic approach. In chapter 2, we show that Classical NR is sensitive to syntactic islands, a fact entirely unexpected under any nonsyntactic view. In chapter 3, we indicate that there are certain contexts (dubbed Horn clauses) that demand the syntactic presence of a negative constituent. But such a negative constituent exists in Horn clauses only under the assumption of the existence of syntactic Classical NR. In chapter 4, we argue that a widely accepted and apparently devastating argument against a syntactic view of Classical NR (dubbed there the Composed Quantifier Argument) is faulty and in no way conclusive. In chapter 5, we discuss the phenomenon of Never-raising. Chapter 6 presents our brief conclusions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001498/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001498<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001498">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001498</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Not yet published</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>negation, raising, islands, polarity, excluded middle, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1467 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001498">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001498">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
