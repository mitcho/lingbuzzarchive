We show that, in certain elliptical contexts, LF tolerates pronouns which cannot have been valued for certain features. A natural conclusion to draw is that this is driven by morphology: one might think that a feature will need valuing just where a value is required in order to determine PF form, and hence that if, for example, no number distinction is formally made, then no number feature needs to be valued. In fact, we will see that the reality is more complex than this, although morphology does play a role. We show that the morphological manifestation of a feature which can in some contexts have real content (such as a value of a phi-feature) does not necessarily have real content in all occurrences. Conversely, a morphologically visible feature whose value is formal in some contexts does not have only a formal value in all occurrences. A further consequence of our observations is that bound variable pronouns and referential pronouns are distinct kinds of syntactic object.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001621/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001621<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001621">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001621</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>unpublished</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>bound variable, ellipsis, features, interfaces, interpretability, pronouns, valuation, individual variation, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>271 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001621">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001621">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
