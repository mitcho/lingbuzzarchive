I argue that many such interactions are due to an anti-locality constraint on movement, which bans movement which is too short. Subject extraction is often distinguished due to the high canonical position of subjects in their clauses (e.g. Spec,TP), making their movement to the clause edge (e.g. Spec,CP) uniquely in danger of violating the Spec-to-Spec Anti-Locality constraint (Erlewine, 2016). Concretely, three subject extraction asymmetry behaviors are discussed and analyzed: complementizer-trace effects, subject anti-agreement effects, and bans on subject resumption, including the so-called Highest Subject Restriction. In each case, we observe that the special behavior associated with subject extraction (a) can be obviated by increasing the distance of movement, (b) also applies to exceptionally high non-subjects, and (c) does not correlate with other subjecthood properties. These facts are straightforwardly explained by the anti-locality-based approach to these asymmetries, but are challenging for alternative accounts.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004765/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004765<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Published 2020, as Glossa volume 5 article 84 — http://doi.org/10.5334/gjgl.1079</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>anti-locality, subject extraction, bundling, complementizer-trace effects, anti-agreement effects, resumption, highest subject restriction, english, swedish, german, yiddish, northern italian, welsh, karitiâna, serbo-croatian, slovenian, hebrew, irish, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004765/v2.pdf">v2 [April 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004765/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1090 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004765">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004765">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
