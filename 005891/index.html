A theory of phrase structure (PS) in the most general sense is a set of hypotheses about how this internal organization of expressions and the dependencies it supports are mentally represented as part of the speakerâ€™s knowledge of language. This vignette focuses on the somewhat neglected question of the limits of PS theory. After demarcating, in most general terms, the analytical purview of such a theory, I will turn to a number of illustrative examples of constructions that have resisted a coherent description in PS terms, which I suggest may indicate that they fall altogether outside its scope.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005891/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005891<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cambridge Handbook of Minimalism (forthcoming)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phrase structure, merge, parenthesis, ellipsis, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>403 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005891">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005891">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
