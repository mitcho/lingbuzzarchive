Taking advantage of data collected during neurosurgical operations on awake patients, here we cross-correlated the cortical activity in the frontal and temporal language areas of a person reading aloud or mentally with the envelope of the sound of the corresponding utterances. In both cases, cortical activity
and the envelope of the sound of the utterances were significantly correlated. This suggests that in hearing people, sound representation deeply informs generation of linguistic expressions at a much higher level than previously thought. This may help in designing new strategies to help people with language
disorders such as aphasia.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005516/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005516<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 112(6): 1868–1873</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>inner speech, syntax, non-acoustic areas, broca's area, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>341 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005516">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005516">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
