Within degree semantics, this paper proposes a novel difference-based (or subtraction-based) perspective to characterize the semantics of comparatives. The main motivation is the measurability and comparability of differences involved in natural language comparatives. The main claim is that comparatives encode a subtraction relation among three items: two measurements on a certain scale and the difference between them. We analyze comparative morpheme -er/more as a default, least specific, positive difference, i.e., (0, +âˆž), and use interval arithmetic to implement subtraction. Our analysis inherits many existing insightful views on the semantics of comparatives. Moreover, the novel interval-subtraction-based implementation brings new conceptual and empirical advantages. In particular, we address the interpretation of comparatives containing numerical differentials and than-clause-internal quantifiers, the scope island status and the monotonicity of than-clauses, as well as a unified comparison-based view for various uses of gradable adjectives.
