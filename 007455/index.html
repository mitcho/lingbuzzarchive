needs loads of attention. It is perceived as an important skill for good language production.
However, it is considered very difficult expertise, particularly in English as second language
contexts where elementary students face numerous challenges in English writing. Writing is
supposed as a significant art for students’ successful academic achievement. Improper teaching of
effective writing skills and can create numerous writing mistakes. Therefore, the present study was
conducted with the aim to investigate elementary students’ writing problems and factors that
hamper their English writing skills. It also illustrates some supportive suggestions on how to
improve elementary students’ effective English writing skills. This article argues that writing is
one of the most prolific skills which sometimes seem very difficult for elementary learners to
develop. Students’ effective writing problems in English language have become a major issue for
English teachers and learners as well. Writing in English is considered a very complex skill  particularly in elementary classrooms where students face numerous challenges regarding this
skill. In the study writing samples were randomly collected from 150 students of grade eight to
find out the most recurrent writing problems in their English subjects. 30 English teachers were
also interviewed in order to know their perceptions about students’ writing difficulties and factors
that hamper their English writing development. SPSS software was applied to compute and
analyze the outcomes of the research. The results of the study indicate that the majority of the
students at elementary level are unable to write grammatically precise English paragraphs.
Students’ writing difficulties cannot be attributed to one factor. Hence, the findings of the study
disclose that the foremost problems of students’ English writing are due to poor command over
English tenses, grammar, syntax and insufficient vocabulary as well as untrained English teachers,
ineffective teaching methods, lack of reading and writing practices and overcrowded classrooms.
Lack of creative ideas, writing anxiety, weak structural organization and dependence on L1 are
also the major cause of learners’ poor writing in English.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007455/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007455<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Webology (ISSN: 1735-188X)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>english writing skills, functional writing problems, elementary students., semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>316 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007455">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007455">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
