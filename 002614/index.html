Previous work (Dillon et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2005; Liu, 2009; Li & Zhou, 2010; cf. Chen et al., 2012) has suggested that comprehenders initially evaluate the fit between the morphologically simple long-distance reflexive 'ziji' and the closest available subject position, only subsequently considering more structurally distant antecedents. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that this locality bias is the result of relatively poor cues to antecedent retrieval associated with the morphologically simple reflexive ziji. This predicts that the locality bias effect should be attenuated for anaphors with richer feature content that may serve as retrieval cues. In Experiment 1, we investigate the processing of ziji and show a strong locality bias for ziji in self-paced reading measures. In Experiment 2, we investigate the processing of the morphologically complex reflexive ta-ziji (lit. s/he-self) in the same structural configurations as Experiment 1. The results of Experiment 2 suggest that ta-ziji is not subject to the same locality bias effects in reading that ziji is. In light of these results, we hypothesize that the relatively impoverished feature content of ziji effectively forces comprehenders to adopt a search strategy to find an appropriate antecedent, resulting in locality bias effects in real-time processing measures. In contrast, relatively feature-rich anaphors like 'ta-ziji' show behavior more consistent with a direct-access antecedent retrieval mechanism, and relatively minimal locality bias effects in reading measures. Our conclusions are in line with other cross-linguistic research that suggests that the morphological features of an anaphoric expression influence how comprehenders retrieve an antecedent from working memory (JÃ¤ger et al, 2015).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002614/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002614<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002614">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002614</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Frontiers in Psychology</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>psycholinguistics, long-distance reflexives, working memory, sentence processing, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002614/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1198 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002614">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002614">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
