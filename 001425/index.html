is twofold: on the one hand to expose all possible constructs that can be qualified as compounds in the language and on the other hand to shed light onto the question concerning the manner in which they are formed. Although we make reference to several theories and models of word formation, our starting point is Lexicalism.
However, the “traditional” Lexicalist views are being checked against more radical theories. The organization of the work goes as follows: In Part1 we give an overview of major theoretical developments concerning Morphology in the Generative paradigm. Part 2 includes concrete examples of compounds and some “traditional” classificatory attempts. Part 3 deals with all possible relations the parts of a compound can have each one with another. Extra gravity is given to the distinction between synthetic and root compounds and to problems that traditional approaches face in their analysis. In part 4 we deal with the question of how lexical items are put together in order to form a compound. In part 5, we examine a hypothesis according to which certain complex words in Greek should be described syntactically along the lines of the transformational rule known as Head-to-Head movement. Finally, in part 6 we claim that certain inconsistencies and asymmetries shown in the system of compounds can be explained via a theory according to which Syntax and Morphology compete
for the generation of complex heads. It is also shown that unpredictable/noncompositional semantics and derivational affixes trigger compound generation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001425/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001425<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>nominal compounds, greek, interfaces, incorporation, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1699 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001425">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001425">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
