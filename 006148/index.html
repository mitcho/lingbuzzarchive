English speakers, for example, tend to perceive alternating
short and long sounds as a series of binary groups with
a final beat (iambs), and alternating soft and loud sounds as a
series of trochees. This generalization, often called the ‘Iambictrochaic
Law’ (ITL), although viewed as an auditory universal
by some, has been argued to be shaped by language experience.
Earlier work on the ITL had a crucial limitation, in that it did not
tease apart the percepts of grouping and prominence, which the
notions of iamb and trochee inherently confound. We explore
how intensity and duration relate to percepts of prominence and
grouping in six languages (English, French, German, Japanese,
Mandarin, and Spanish). The results show that the ITL is not
universal, and that cue interpretation is shaped by language experience.
However, there are also invariances: Duration appears
relatively robust across languages as a cue to prominence
(longer syllables are perceived as stressed), and intensity for
grouping (louder syllables are perceived as initial). The results
show the beginnings of a rhythmic typology based on how the
dimensions of grouping and prominence are cued.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006148/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006148<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Interspeech 2021</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>rhythm, typology, iambic trochaic law, perception, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>349 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006148">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006148">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
