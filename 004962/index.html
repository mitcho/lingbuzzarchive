An explanatorily adequate characterization of a given utterance factorizes the contributions of each of the subsystems on the one hand, and on the other hand, it reduces its apparent complexity to the interaction of less complex subsystems. 

Scrambling is an excellent show case. Its complex properties are not inherent properties of a construction but the result of the interaction of phrase structuring with other subsystems of grammar, and in particular with the information-structuring (IS) subsystem of pragmatics. If – as practiced by Generative Grammar – syntactic structures are modelled as products of an abstract sequential construction process, the sequence of steps in the derivation scenario is viewed in a quasi-deterministic cause & effect perspective. Such a perspective is highly misleading , however. It is bound to fail when syntax provides options that are utilized by other subsystems. This happens when the structure system interacts with semantics, prosody, or pragmatics. In this case, the Generative modelling strategy seeks syntactic triggers where there are none. 

Germanic and Slavic languages are handy testimonies for rejecting a strict trigger scenario, not only for scrambling but for filler-gap constructions in general. Neither 'movement' to Spec-C, nor 'movement' to Spec-T, nor Scrambling is a matter of syntactical determinism. Fronting and Scrambling are structural options provided by syntax. These options are subsequently utilized by other subsystems of grammar. These modules, however, do not trigger structural configurations , they merely exploit them. If a grammar provides alternative structural options, these options are just utilized. From a syntax-only stance, they may appear as if syntactically triggered.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004962/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004962<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>(in press) Special issue of Zeitschrift für Sprachwissenschaft, ed. by Volker Struckmeier & Andreas Pankau, 2020.  doi 10.13140/RG.2.2.28715.18725</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>generative syntax, scrambling, interfaces, germanic, slavic, sov, svo, type 3; scope, binding, information structure</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004962/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>107 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004962">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004962">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
