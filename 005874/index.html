However, the interaction between the A and Ā features is not the same in every case. Assuming that Ā movement is predicated on an Agree relationship, I analyze two types of mixed A/Ā Agreement. In the first type, one probe searches for the A and Ā features conjunctively, such that both features must befound together. With novel fieldwork data, I illustrate that this pattern is found in Ndengeleko (Bantu). The conjunctive pattern is challenging to capture from a standard, two-probe perspec-tive on mixed positions (following Chomsky 2001). Building on work on probes’ satisfaction conditions (Deal 2015a,b,2020), I show that the Ndengeleko pattern is best captured by a probe with a conjunctive satisfaction condition. In the second type of A/Ā movement, one syntactic head happens to host two probes (one A and one Ā). This pattern is found in Kipsigis (Bossi & Diercks 2019). The notion of conjunctive satisfaction allows us to capture agreement patterns which targets two features, which extends beyond mixed A/ Ā agreement. What emerges is a typology of mixed Agree operations in which features can be sought conjunctively, disjunctively,or independently. The empirical landscape places both conjunctive and disjunctive satisfaction as central to the Agree operation. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005874/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005874<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>Ā movement, mixed agreement, agree, satisfaction conditions, interaction/satisfaction, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005874/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>517 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005874">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005874">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
