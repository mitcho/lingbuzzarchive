within a phonological framework that assumes gestures as the units of subsegmental
representation. Originally developed within Articulatory Phonology (Browman & Goldstein 1986,
1989, et seq.), gestures are dynamically defined units of phonological representation that are
specified for a target articulatory state of the vocal tract. In the Gestural Harmony Model, harmony
is triggered when a gesture extends its period of activation and overlaps other segments in a word.
To model this ability of a gesture to extend its activation, I propose the addition of two new
parameters to the representation of gestures: persistence and anticipation. With the addition of
these parameters, gestures can be specified as either self-deactivating or persistent (non-selfdeactivating),
and as either self-activating or anticipatory (early-activating). A persistent gesture
is one that does not self-deactivate when its goal articulatory state is achieved, thus overlapping
following segments and triggering progressive (rightward) harmony. An anticipatory gesture is
one that is activated early, thus overlapping preceding segments and triggering regressive
(leftward) harmony.

In addition to these representational innovations, I develop a phonological grammar,
situated within the framework of Optimality Theory (Prince & Smolensky 1993/2004), that
operates over gestural representations. The presence of harmony in a language is attributed to
whether the segments in a languageâ€™s surface phonological inventory contain persistent and/or
anticipatory gestures. As a result, in the Gestural Harmony Model patterns of harmony triggering
result from the interaction of markedness and faithfulness constraints that shape the surface
inventory and determine the distributions of the segments in that inventory. One of the major
advantages of the approach to harmony triggering in the Gestural Harmony Model is that harmony
systems in which bearers of a harmonizing property idiosyncratically trigger or fail to trigger
harmony can be attributed to preservation of a contrast between persistent and self-deactivating
gestures in the case of progressive harmony, and anticipatory and self-activating gestures in the
case of regressive harmony. This approach to harmony triggering avoids the pathological
predictions made by some other analyses of phonological idiosyncrasy and exceptionality.

The Gestural Harmony Modelâ€™s representation of harmony also proves advantageous in
the analysis of transparency and blocking. In this model, transparency and blocking are the results
of two distinct theoretical mechanisms, successfully accounting for the distinct crosslinguistic
patterns in the attestation of transparent and blocking segments in some types of harmony. I
analyze transparent segments as undergoers of harmony that include in their representations a
gesture that is antagonistic to a harmonizing gesture. Antagonistic gestures are those that are
specified for directly conflicting target articulatory states of the vocal tract, and as a result enter
into competition with one another. Transparency arises when intergestural competition is resolved
in favor of the gesture of the transparent segment due to its greater specified gestural strength.
Blocking of harmony, on the other hand, results from a different theoretical mechanism:
intergestural inhibition, by which one gesture deactivates another. The Gestural Harmony Modelâ€™s
splitting of transparency and blocking among two distinct theoretical mechanisms makes several
advantageous typological predictions. Chief among these is that in some types of harmony, the set
of attested transparent segments is a subset of the set of attested blocking segments. This is
attributed to the idea that only certain types of segments possess the gestural makeup necessary to
surface as transparent to harmony when overlapped by a harmonizing gesture.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004180/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004180<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Southern California dissertation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>harmony; vowel harmony; vowel-consonant harmony; gestures; gestural phonology; articulatory phonology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>385 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004180">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004180">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
