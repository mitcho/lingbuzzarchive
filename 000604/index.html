Probing into the structure of Kurdish Ergative construction with concentration on the nature of quirky dative subjects and nominative objects and their associated dative and nominative clitics, on the one hand, and comparing our findings from Kurdish to other similar recalcitrant cases reported from languages like Basque and Catalan, on the other hand, we argue for a refinement of the precise formulation of PCC as currently assumed. We propose that the proper application of PCC should be made sensitive to contexts where both dative and nominative/accusative clitics/agreement markers involved in an agreement cluster refer to arguments entering into Multiple Agree with a probing head. At an explanatory level this work provides corroborative evidence in favor of syntactic treatments of the PCC and argues against any attempt to derive the effects of PCC in purely morphological terms.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000604/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000604<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ergative construction, person-case constraint, multiple agree, inherent case, intervention, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>515 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000604">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000604">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
