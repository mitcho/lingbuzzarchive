The prediction is that movement of the DP past the intervener should be able to feed person Agree with H. This is demonstrated by applicative unaccusatives in Basque. The PCC occurs for all speakers, and blocks person Agree between the absolutive Case/Agree locus v and 1st/2nd person subject, in the presence of a dative experiencer. Some speakers allow the subject to become ergative in all and only PCC contexts (absolutive displacement). The subject raises past the dative to satisfy the EPP of T. It is argued that the raising allows a new person Agree relation between ergative Case/Agree locus T and the subject, in which the dative can no longer intervene. Icelandic "long raising" is adduced to illustrate the proposed contingency of agreement on movement. Extension to accusative languages resolves the mystery of the apparent absence of the PCC from applicative unaccusatives in them. The result is simply not detectable from surface case and agreement in them, but the mechanics correctly predict that the PCC resurfaces when the subject cannot move past the intervener.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000397/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000397<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000397">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000397</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pcc, agree, cyclicity, dative-intervention, a-movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>276 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000397">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000397">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
