Comparative data from previously understudied languages reveals that such affixal alternations are best analyzed as the morphological realization of different bundles of A- and A-bar Agree relations probing the same goal (i.e. topics/relativized phrases). Similar portmanteau agreement is found in Nilotic and Caucasian, with four loci of variation attested: (a) presence or absence of φ-feature agreement with the goal, (b) number of voice distinctions (i.e. how many bundles of Agree relations are realised in narrow syntax), (c) the type of A-bar operations that trigger the hybrid agreement, and (d) whether the goal undergoes overt A-bar movement. I argue that this type of hybrid agreement is a feature of discourse configurationality (Li & Thompson 1985; É Kiss 1995; Miyagawa 2010), which functions to index the φ-agreement relation of the phrase simultaneously under Agree relation with an A ̄bar probe. If this analysis is on the right track, it reveals that φ-feature agreement is not the only available means of indicating abstract A-bar Agree relations, and that what is known as ‘Austronesian-type voice’ or ‘wh-agreement’ in the literature constitutes an understudied type of agreement that serves a similar purpose.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006323/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006323<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>a-bar agreement, austronesian-type voice, topic agreement, a-bar feature geometry, philippine-type voice, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006323/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1131 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006323">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006323">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
