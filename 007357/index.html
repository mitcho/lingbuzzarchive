These representations
can be encoded in at least two ways: as discrete, phonetically-based features, or as continuous, distribution-based representations induced from the statistical patterning of sounds. Because phonological theory typically assumes
that representations are discrete, past work has reduced continuous representations to discrete ones, which eliminates potentially relevant information. In this paper we present a model of phonotactics that can use continuous representations directly, and show that this approach yields competitive performance on modeling experimental judgments of English sonority sequencing. The proposed model broadens the space of possible phonotactic models by removing requirements for discrete features, and is a step towards an integrated picture of phonotactic learning based on distributional statistics and continuous representations.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007357/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007357<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the Society for Computation in Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonotactics, gradience, constraints, distributional learning, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>339 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007357">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007357">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
