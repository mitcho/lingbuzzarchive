Whilst the focus is on intransitive verbs, transitives are also considered. A new analysis of split intransitive and thematic role phenomena is presented based in a functional hierarchy of multiple functional heads (Initiation, State, Change and Telic), each of which is a thematic role assigner and may merge an argument in its specifier. Different values of the features borne by these heads correspond to multiple dierent classes of intransitive verbs as picked out by different ‘unaccusativity diagnostics’: the classes picked out by these diagnostics are discussed and formal analyses of the diagnostics themselves are sketched. It is argued that this new analysis is superior to the traditional unaccusative hypothesis which identifies only two classes of intransitives and two possible positions for intransitive arguments.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002786/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002786<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>split intransitivity, unaccusativity, unaccusative hypothesis, thematic roles, theta-roles, intransitives, english, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1596 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002786">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002786">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
