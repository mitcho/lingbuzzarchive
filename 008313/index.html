noun paradigm represented by independent relative genitive whose.
Contrary to previous claims that English lacks this form entirely, I
argue that its extremely limited distribution can be explained through
a combination of syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and information-
structural constraints. Drawing on historical examples, contempo-
rary usage, and cross-linguistic comparisons, I demonstrate that what
appears to be a syntactic impossibility is in fact a highly restricted
but grammatical construction. The study reveals how factors such as
accessibility, topicality, and contrastive focus license the use of inde-
pendent relative whose in specific contexts. This analysis has broader
implications for linguistic theory, suggesting that apparent gaps in
grammatical paradigms may sometimes be more accurately explained
by considering the interface between syntax and pragmatics. The
paper contributes to our understanding of the interplay between dif-
ferent linguistic levels in constraining grammatical constructions and
highlights the importance of considering pragmatic and information-
structural factors in syntactic analysis.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008313/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008313<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>TBD</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>independent relative whose, syntactic constraints, semantic constraints, pragmatic constraints, information structure, accessibility, topicality, contrastive focus, grammatical constructions, genitive pronouns, historical usage, contemporary examples, cross-linguistic comparisons, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>197 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008313">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008313">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
