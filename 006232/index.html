Early work within rule-based theories of phonology developed explicit mechanisms to induce both iterative and non-iterative patterns (e.g., Howard 1973; Anderson 1974). The issue of (non)iterativity has not received as much attention in more recent work, with the notable exception of Kaplan (2008), who argues that both iterativity and non-iterativity are emergent concepts, and are always derivable from other forces at work in the grammar. In this paper, we examine the status of non-iterativity, drawing on production data from Crimean Tatar. We argue that, in line with previous descriptions of the language, rounding harmony is truly non-iterative in the Central dialect, and not derivable from other, independent patterns in the language. We also briefly discuss data from several other languages that exhibit non-iterative spreading. We contend that the presence of these patterns demands a formal account, and we discuss the analysis of non-iterativity in both rule- and constraint-based theories, discussing their different predictions for the typology of feature spreading.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006232/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006232<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Glossa: A journal of general linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>iterativity; vowel harmony; phonology; acoustics, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006232/v2.pdf">v2 [February 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006232/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>662 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006232">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006232">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
