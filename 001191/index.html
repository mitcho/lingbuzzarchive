They display high diversity, differentiate in space and time, emerge and disappear. A large body of literature has explored the role of information exchanges and communicative constraints in groups of agents under selective scenarios. These models have been very helpful in providing a rationale on how complex forms of communication emerge under evolutionary pressures. However, other patterns of large-scale organization can be described using mathematical methods ignoring communicative traits. These approaches consider shorter time scales and have been developed by exploiting both theoretical ecology and statistical physics methods. The models are reviewed here and include extinction, invasion, origination, spatialorganization, coexistence and diversity as key concepts and are very simple in their defining rules. Such simplicity is used in order to catch the most fundamental laws of organization and those universal ingredients responsible for qualitative traits. The similarities between observed and predicted patterns indicate that an ecological theory of language is emerging, supporting (on a quantitative basis) its ecological nature, although key differences are also present. Here, we critically review some recent advances and outline their implications and limitations as well as highlight problems for future research.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001191/current.pdf?_s=A2jY6VLU-F6hMN5S">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001191<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001191">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001191</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language dynamics; extinction; diversity; competition; phase transitions, morphology, syntax, semantics, morphology, syntax, semantics (phonology)</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>102 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001191?_s=WcHVxR02tVqDKJon&amp;_k=FRl1U1dmXkyt4M2j&amp;4">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001191?_s=WcHVxR02tVqDKJon&amp;_k=FRl1U1dmXkyt4M2j&amp;5">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
