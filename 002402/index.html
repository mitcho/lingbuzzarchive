(1)	The company has seen two developments in the standard of hygiene  which are felt  are attributable to the fact that the programme is now fully up and running. 

At first sight, the example seems to be derived by illicit subject raising from within a finite clause which - at least in English - is standardly unacceptable, regardless of the presence of the complementizer that. However, some  native speaking informants accept data as (1) and such data are also attested. 
Because the pattern in (1) is tied to wh-movement and is unavailable with a regular DP subject we will call the pattern in (1) wh-raising. 

Using a cartographic framework, we will develop an analysis for the derivation of the data in (1) framed against the background of Rizzi’s (2006) approach to subject extraction<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002402/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002402<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>subject extraction, raising, finiteness, subject criterion, agreement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002402/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>934 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002402">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002402">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
