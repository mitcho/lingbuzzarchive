G&K provide an analysis of the de-dicto interpretation in which the bracketed expression refers to an individual concept. B&R question this because equivalent expressions in Hebrew, in which the gap is rendered by a resumptive pronoun, do not exhibit the de dicto interpretation, but only the de re interpretation. We provide independent evidence that person-marked pronouns in post-copular position are incompatible with antecedents that denote individual concepts, thus explaining B&R’s observation within G&K’s framework. We furthermore point out two new problems for the analysis of B&R presented in the body of their article, which does not make use of individual concepts or of some alternative mechanism that can deal with substitutivity in opaque contexts. We also note that an alternative analysis they present in an appendix amounts to a notational variant of ours.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007998/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007998<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistics & Philosophy 45</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>relative clauses, individual concepts, movements, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>155 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007998">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007998">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
