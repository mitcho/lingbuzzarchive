The facts can be schematically described as follows: At Stage 0, a linguistic system L possesses a single imperfective or neutral aspectual marker X that is used to express two contextually disambiguable meanings α and β . At Stage 1, a progressive marker Y arises spontaneously in L in order to express α in some contexts. At Stage 2, Y becomes entrenched as an obligatory grammatical element for expressing α while X is restricted in use to expressing β . At Stage 3, Y generalizes and is used to express both α and β . X is gradually driven out of L. Stage 3 (structurally identical to Stage 0) is often followed by another instantiation of Stage 1, with the innovation of a new progressive marker Z. The trajectory to be explained is thus cyclic.
The analysis has a semantic component that characterizes the logical relation between the progressive and imperfective operators in terms of asymmetric entailment. Its dynamic component rests on the proposal that imperfective and progressive sentences crucially distinguish between two kinds of inquiries: phenomenal and structural inquiries (Goldsmith and Woisetschleger 1982). The innovation and entrenchment of progressive marking in languages is shown to be underpinned by optimal ways of resolving both kinds of inquiries in discourse given considerations of successful and economic communication. Generalization is analyzed as the result of imperfect learning. The cyclic trajectory — consisting of the recruitment of a progressive form, its categorical use in phenomenal in- quiries, and its generalization to imperfective meaning — is modeled within the framework of Evolutionary Game Theory.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002109/current.rtf?_s=cX_W5mutJiWpyWFl">rtf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002109<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002109">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002109</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Semantics and Pragmatics: http://dx.doi.org/10.3765/sp.8.14</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>evolutionary game theory, pragmatics, semantics, imperfective, progressive, aspect, grammaticalization, crosslinguistic variation</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002109/v7.pdf?_s=MtNsq8kNq0a0VAhp">v7 [March 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002109/v6.pdf?_s=2-HDY7vCP24sG5As">v6 [May 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002109/v5.pdf?_s=7n0o0YxApYJkNloe">v5 [March 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002109/v4.pdf?_s=mfbl5hQqSYIjFS_Y">v4 [January 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002109/v3.pdf?_s=uZ7NpxMgPJ9aughS">v3 [October 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002109/v2.pdf?_s=JcfL81Y7KhA6TN0S">v2 [October 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002109/v1.pdf?_s=-E3NF2Q3fGKAT5qy">v1 [June 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3246 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002109?_s=R1mohBkBzAO_0ujl&amp;_k=3wP5AJYzSHno-znx&amp;2">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002109?_s=R1mohBkBzAO_0ujl&amp;_k=3wP5AJYzSHno-znx&amp;3">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
