We propose Derivational Minimalist Syntax (DMS), an interpretive principle claiming that the sequence of structure-building operations in the derivation of a sentence directly correlates with the sequence in which those structures are acquired by children (with Merge-based syntax being the primary mechanism for grammaticalizing language input). This correlation arises because mechanisms/operations of Universal Grammar are language acquisition devices; specifically, they are mechanisms for children to grammaticalize patterns they encounter in their input during acquisition. Thus, adult grammatical knowledge contains earlier stages of grammatical knowledge, and retains that knowledge, which is evidenced in the derivational sequence of a Minimalist syntactic analysis. On this approach, counter-cyclic operations in adult grammars are the result of grammatical patterns being acquired ``earlier'' or ``later'' than a strict application of bottom-up structure building would require. This brief note is intended to make the core concepts of the larger manuscript more accessible.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005945/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005945<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>TBD</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>countercyclicity, merge, smt, minimalist, construction grammar, acquisition, countercyclic, late merger, wholesale late merger, look-ahead, syntax, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005945/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>464 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005945">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005945">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
