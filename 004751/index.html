This assumption has been the subject of much debate, especially in the last two
decades, with many authors questioning its validity, often to criticize assumptions about constituency
and structure in frameworks like Generative Syntax. This paper enters this debate
by reconsidering a constraint on left-sharing in coordination which Osborne and Gross (2017)
have recently introduced (*The merchant of [Venice was broke] and [Verona was rich]), and
which they call left node blocking (LNB). To account for LNB, O&G propose the Principle of
Full Clusivity (PFC) which states that coordination cannot cut into a constituent, assuming that
coordination does not have to conjoin constituents and that syntactic structures should be flat.
Presenting evidence that coordination must target constituents, I argue that LNB is captured by
general constraints on movement, ellipsis, or selection; thus, a construction-specific principle
such as the PFC is redundant, and the claim that LNB argues for flat syntactic structures becomes
untenable. LNB can be perfectly captured by a grammar that assumes binary-branching
structures, and it provides evidence for the generalization that coordination can only operate
on constituents.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004751/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004751<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>coordination, constituency, structure, left node blocking, ellipsis, movement</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004751/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>124 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004751">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004751">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
