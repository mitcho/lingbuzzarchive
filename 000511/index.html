ABSTRACT: This paper consists of two main sections. First, I critically evaluate Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1995)Â’s lexical-semantics-based analysis of CHANGE- OF-STATE verbs and their relation to the CAUSATIVE ALTERNATION concluding that the lexical-semantic approach is empirically unmotivated and therefore LEXICAL SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS in the lexicon constitute an unnecessary complication to the grammar. In the second section, adopting their proposal which divides change-of-state verbs into INTERNALLY- and EXTERNALLY-CAUSED EVENTUALITIES (ibid.), I propose a LATE-INSERTION approach (Halle and Marantz, 1993, et seq) for roots participating in the Causative Alternation. Though the claims I make are limited to languages which indicate verbal adicity morphologically since the properties of interest are most transparent in such languages, the result is an analysis more closely aligned with the contemporary syntactic findings of the MINIMALIST PROGRAM (Chomsky, 1995 and 2001, among many), in particular its instantiation as DISTRIBUTED MORPHOLOGY (DM) (Halle and Marantz, 1993 and Embick and Noyer, 2007).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000511/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000511<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>working paper</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dm, lexical semantics, change-of-state unaccusatives, the causative alternation, late-insertion, internally and externally-caused eventualities, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000511/v2.pdf">v2 [September 2007]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000511/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2007]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2581 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000511">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000511">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
