Nevertheless, the assumption of a separate primitive dedicated to hosting extra-grammatical information — as opposed to functional primitives, such as syntactic features — is entirely compatible with the Minimalist Program, once it paves the way for an in-depth evaluation of the interplay of the lexicon with other components of the Faculty of Language (FL). Assuming roots to be grammatical primitives brings to the forefront of linguistic minimalism the question of what the ‘atoms’ of syntactic computation are, since it demands a rigorous investigation of which properties are inherent to them and which are emergent (i.e., contextually derived), as well as whether their superficial features are packaged as a whole in the same grammatical component.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006497/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006497<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cambridge Handbook of Minimalism</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>root, minimalism, contentless, acategorial, polysemy, suppletion, late insertion, category, index, evolution, vervet monkey, semitic, greek, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>635 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006497">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006497">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
