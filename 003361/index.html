The characteristic property of this pattern is the sometimes implicit, but often overt and obligatory presence of a locative PP which embeds a body-part noun in a VP which is otherwise monotransitive. Figure reflexive constructions are syntactically unified by the fact that their internal argument is conceptualized as a prepositional small clause, which introduces the Figure-Ground relation. These constructions are also Voiced, in the sense that an external argument position is projected even if it may be non-thematic. Unaccusatives are analyzed as introducing an expletive, i.e. non-thematic Voice projection, whose role is simply to signal that the event structure of transitives and derived unaccusatives is the same, consisting of a causing subevent and a result state. The discussion of unaccusatives is theoretically relevant in that it strengthens the suggestion that there is a connection between the expletivization of Voice and derived reflexive unaccusativity.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003361/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003361<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>reflexive constructions; figure-ground relation; expletive voice; derived unaccusatives; romanian, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>312 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003361">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003361">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
