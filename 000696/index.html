The empirical basis is data from South German dialects which violate the Doubly-filled-Comp-Filter. Contrary to common beliefs, the insertion of a complementizer in addition to a moved wh-item is not unconstrained. Rather, the co-occurrence of a syntactically and phonologically simple wh-word together with a complementizer is ruled out whereas internally complex wh-phrases basically require a complementizer. The proposal is that these short wh-words can fulfill the function of a complementizer in addition to their clause-typing function as wh-elements. It is argued that these items have a "latent C-feature" which is activated under specific structural conditions. As "virtual" complementizers they project (after re-merge as a head) a CP which is additionally marked as <+wh>. The analysis is supported by morpho-phonological processes in these dialects as well as by similar patterns found in North-Norwegian. The suggested solution opens a realistic view on grammaticalization processes that lead to the emergence of various types of complementizers, e.g. the "what"-type declarative complementizers in various Indo-European languages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000696/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000696<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Chang C.
