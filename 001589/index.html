Previous studies consist of two competing accounts for the definiteness agreement. Under the first account, the definite marker _ha_ is a D head selecting the adjective it marks for definiteness (similarly to nouns) (e.g. Sichel 2002); under the second account, the definite marker is a syntactic definiteness feature inherent to the noun or determiner, which spreads to other elements in the DP (e.g. Borer 1996).

In this paper, I present novel data from degree modification of coordinated adjectives in Hebrew and Arabic. I show that the scope ambiguities and definiteness marking patterns in various structures provide evidence for an analysis whereby definiteness is a syntactic feature that surfaces as the phrasal clitic _ha-_ ‘the’. In addition, I show that the structure-sensitive, though post-syntactic, morphological operation of LOCAL DISLOCATION generates the correct distribution of the Hebrew and Arabic definite marker, namely it being a phrasal proclitic occurring at the left-edge of phrases, as well as the intricate pattern of definiteness agreement in Hebrew and Arabic attributive adjectives.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001589/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001589<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the 42nd meeting of NELS</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>coordination, local dislocation, adjectives, degree modifiers, definite marker, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>428 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001589">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001589">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
