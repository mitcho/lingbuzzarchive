Chomsky (2000) claims that positing uninterpretable features (like Case features) is not purely stipulation, but that uninterpretable features are justified by their visible effects in the syntax. This paper presents evidence that the syntactic effects predicted by Case Theory are not borne out in Bantu languages, which in fact display effects that are only predicted to be possible in the absence of uninterpretable Case features. Evidence includes constructions where Case-checking should require a DP to cease being active, but it does not do so (e.g. compound tenses and raising constructions), as well as instances where Case-checking could not have occurred, but the constructions are nonetheless acceptable (e.g. possible-constructions and locative inversion) . It is claimed that uninterpretable Case features are not present in Bantu languages, and that it is instead gender features that make a goal active for Agree (following Carstens (to appear)).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001188/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001188<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Pomona College</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>case, agreement, bantu, gender, activity condition, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>623 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001188">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001188">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
