It hypothesizes that the Arabic Alphabet (e.g. أ ب ت ث ج ح) are written and drawn based on the angle of the face, the movement of the lips, the position of the tongue as well as the participation of other articulators in their production (such as teeth, alveolar ridge, palate, velum among others). For instance, the Arabic letter ب /b/ is written as a boat with a lower dot (i.e. ب), representing the shape of the lower lip (i.e. a boat) and representing the downward movement of the lip (i.e. a lower dot).  The letter ث /θ/ is also represented as a boat with three upper dots, following the shape of the lower lip (i.e. a boat) and following the participations of the two higher teeth and the tip of the tongue, yielding three dots. In other words, Arabic letters are phonetically drawn based on the shape of the mouth whereas the position of the dots follows the movement of the lip/tongue and the participation of other articulators. Although several Arabic letters may have less clear justifications, most of them seem to follow this hypothesis in mouth-writing or sound-symbol mapping. These findings highlight the ancient Arab’s awareness of the phonetic articulation of Arabic letters, and provide pedagogical insight into the education of the Arabic alphabet in general. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006566/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006566<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>arabic alphabet, arabic letters, phonetic symbols, nabataean, syriac, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>658 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006566">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006566">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
