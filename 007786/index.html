The analysis is implemented in a generative distributed model of grammar and lexicon, along the lines of Halle and Marantz (1993), Marantz (1997, 2001), Harley (2014), among various other contributions on roots, as well as insights about the syntax of the lexicon in Hale and Keyser (2002), or Fassi Fehri, Saeed, & Alotaibi (2021). It is argued that ‘words’ as lexical items start their derivation as abstract syntactic roots, which merge with functional heads to be categorized; they then get interpreted as vocabulary items in the dictionary at the PF interface, or as semantic entities or eventualities at the LF interface, in line with Chomsky’s (1995, 2019) minimalist design. Roots of motion events are associated with simple or complex eventualities (e.g., √ḤRK ‘√MOVE’ represents a simple root MOTION component, while √JRY '√RUN' represents a complex root component, resulting from merging the overt MANNER modifier to a silent MOTION root. We present evidence that roots are not distributively free (contra Borer 2005, 2014), but rather ontologically construed in composing with other roots, patterns, categories, and structures (Harley 2014, Marantz 1997, Levin & Rappaport 2010, 2017). Limitations on motion event/verb meanings then depend first on root classes. Traditional Manner/Path Typology (Talmy 2000) is reconsidered, and an alternative analysis to the complexity of traditionally directed motion verbs like daxala ‘enter’ and xaraja ‘go out’ is motivated, in addition to other subclasses of motion events. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007786/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007786<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Rabat, Morocco</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>motion events; event classes; root syntax; category syntax; distributed morphology; path; manner; arabic lexicon, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>294 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007786">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007786">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
