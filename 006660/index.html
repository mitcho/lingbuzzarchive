We focus on Harbour 2016 who proposes a system that describes all and only the attested categories without appeal to additional postulates such as a person hierarchy, but introduces several novel assumptions about the semantics of features. We suggest that the key innovation in Harbour's proposal is the use of cumulative (non-Boolean) conjunction in word-internal composition. We offer a more conservative alternative, showing that the main result can be derived with cumulative conjunction and exhaustification, while avoiding the other novel assumptions in Harbour's approach. Moreover, we contend that our approach is empirically superior regarding certain apparently mixed clusivity systems, notably Mandarin pronouns. More broadly, the result argues that cumulative conjunction and exhaustification are available in word-internal semantics just like in sentence semantics.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006660/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006660<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>clusivity, cumulative conjunction, exhaustification, person, syou, universals, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>161 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006660">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006660">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
