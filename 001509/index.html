On the one hand, there is extensive literature discussing subject/object asymmetries in complementizer insertion/drop in Mainland Scandinavian A'-dependencies (cf. Taraldsen 1986, Allan et al. 1995:193, Faarlund et al. 1997: 193, Teleman et al. 1999:555, Thráinsson 2007: 443, a.o.). On the other hand, Icelandic does not display such an asymmetry (Thráinsson 2007: 409), but is the only Scandinavian language with productive Stylistic Fronting, whereas Faroese displays a mixed behavior (cf. Thráinsson et al. 2004, Thráinsson 2007). Stylistic Fronting (SF) is a specific type of fronting that moves various types of constituents to a preverbal position, is restricted to clauses lacking an overt preverbal subject and is productive in subordinate clauses (e.g. embedded Wh- , relative clauses; Maling 1980, 1990, Jónsson 1991, Holmberg 2000). It has been suggested that SF is an EPP-driven mechanism (Holmberg 2000, Ott 2009) or that SF licenses subject extraction, which seems to some extent controversional (Rögnvaldsson & Thráinsson 1990; cf. Franco 2009a, 2009b), thus it may be concluded that Icelandic also display some sort of subject/object asymmetry at the CP-IP interface. 
The paper proposes a unifying analysis for Mainland Scandinavian, Icelandic and, potentially, Faroese, and argues that SF and SOM insertion are two different strategies to check one of the (at least) two features encoded on the lowest CP head Fin0 (cf. Rizzi 1997). Such feature-checking mechanism ensures proper anchoring of the clausal semantic content (i.e. event structure and clausal arguments) to the discourse. The account is based on comparative synchronic and diachronic facts, such as recent findings on long extractions in Mainland Scandinavian, with respect to drop/insertion of the complementizer SOM, and the diachronic evolution and loss of SF in Old Swedish (Delsing 2001), by contrast to Icelandic.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001509/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001509<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>scandinavian, stylistic fronting, complementizer, finiteness, subject/object asymmetries., syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>489 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001509">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001509">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
