Comitative conjunctions with the 1st or 2nd person singular pronoun as the host are prohibited, while comitative conjunctions with a non-pronominal DP or a plural pronoun as the host are grammatical. To explain this, first, I present a uniform analysis that brings together comitative conjunctions and so-called  Inclusive Plural Pronoun Constructions, whereby they are headed by a functional head (D) that can be realized overtly as a personal pronoun, as in `we, I with Sergej', or as a silent pro. In this I am arguing against those approaches that group comitative conjunctions involving referential conjuncts with AND coordination and juxtapose them to IPPCs. Second, I propose that the person restriction stems from a combination of the following factors: (1) the mode of agreement with multiple goals and the timing of resolving multiple sets of phi-features on a single probe, and (2) the inventory of silent pronouns available in the language. The analysis accounts for the behavior of comitative conjunctions in Russian, and further allows us to capture the difference between Russian, a language with no consistent pro-drop, and, for instance, Polish, a full pro-drop language where no person restriction is imposed on the relevant construction.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007729/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007729<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>accepted to Journal of Slavic Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>conjunction, coordination, comitatives, pro-drop, multiple agreement, feature resolution, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>320 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007729">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007729">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
