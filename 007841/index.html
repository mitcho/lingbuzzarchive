This tripartite depiction of linguistic behavior is distinctive in that it is unique within the animal world and central to any scientific account of human language. The successes of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Natural Language Processing—chiefly in their ability to produce human-like text—altogether fail to shed any light on this “creative aspect of language use” (CALU). Such models fail to reproduce this ability without exception. Moreover, they offer no account of how humans acquire the ability to use their language in this tripartite fashion and what role this should play in a theory of human language. Against this background, I argue that Steven Piantadosi’s (2023) critique of Chomsky’s approach to linguistics (and related arguments) is misguided. More specifically, I argue that the failure to shed any scientific light on CALU amounts to a deficiency of a methodology that considers LLMs accurate models of human language and a vindication of the “Galilean” style of inquiry employed by Chomsky.
