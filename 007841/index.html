This tripartite depiction of linguistic behavior is central to any scientific account of human language. The successes of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Natural Language Processing—chiefly in their ability to produce text that appears human-like—altogether fail to shed any light on this “creative aspect of language use” (CALU). Such models fail to reproduce this ability without exception. Moreover, they fail to identify CALU as part of an adequate descriptive account of human language and to tease out its implications for a science of language. Against this background, I argue that Steven Piantadosi’s (2023) critique of Chomsky’s approach to linguistics—namely, in the conception of LLMs as theories of human language—is misguided. More specifically, I argue that Chomsky’s approach to linguistics, properly understood, proceeds from two, complementary bases of inquiry: the “Galilean” method and CALU. Together, these bases vindicate the importance of theoretical maneuvers including the competence-performance distinction and the abstraction of the human language faculty.
