Therefore, earlier research has backed the assumption that a NEST is by nature the ideal person to teach English. With a purpose to challenge this assumption, the current study, consisting of two phases, aims to explore in the first phase if there is a meaningful difference between Turkish EFL learners’ perceptions of NESTs and NNESTs on their first encounter with them. The second phase explores whether any changes have occurred in students’ preconceptions regarding NESTs within the course of time. The participants are 120 Turkish monolinguals from a private university. Quantitative data was collected through questionnaires consisting of Likert-scale items in both phases. An interview session was added to the second phase to obtain more in-depth insights into students’ perceptions. The findings of the first phase showed that overall, students had neutral perceptions of NESTs and NNESTs. However, in the second phase, the data analysed via qualitative content analysis demonstrated that students’ perceptions were found to have positively changed for NESTs, particularly in terms of personality dimension. In both phases, students perceived NESTs in linguistic and professional dimensions, and NNESTs in pedagogical dimension rather positively. Some implications and directions for further research are briefly discussed.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003192/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003192<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Novitas-ROYAL (Research on Youth and Language)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>prototype theory, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>654 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003192">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003192">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
