This paper challenges that view arguing (on the basis of data from German and English) that names show a mass-count distinction as well. This and further generalizations concerning nonreferential expressions support Borer's (2005) structural account of the mass-count distinction based on the presence or absence of an abstract sortal classifier, as opposed standard mereological or conceptual accounts. The structural account of the mass-count distinction will be given a novel interpretation in terms of plural reference and (irreducible) mass reference.
    The papers also contributes to the theory of quotation, arguing that certain names (in German and English) are not specified as nouns and thus are forced to appear in quotational contexts, on a particular understanding of quotation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002393/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002393<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002393">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002393</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>mass-count distinction, proper names, quotation, plural reference, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1635 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002393">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002393">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
