Any and all feedback gratefully received.* This dissertation explores the cognition underlying the knowledge, use, and acquisition of human language – the faculty for language, or language faculty (FL). In particular, it examines the validity and utility of the set of related, but logically independent proposals comprising the argument of linguistic Minimalism (LM). These proposals define an atheoretic research program for linguistic enquiry – the Minimalist Program for Linguistic Theory (MP) (Chomsky 1993) – as well as introducing specific claims about the status of linguistic variation and the FL’s broader role in human cognition. 

Chapter 1 defends the existence of a coherent subject matter for ‘biolinguistic’ enquiry of this kind. 

Chapter 2 attempts to clarify those Minimalist proposals which comprise the MP, and to present their compulsory logic; it offers an explicit (if partial) framework for Minimalist research based around principles of algorithmic science. 

Chapter 3 argues for the validity of the substantive hypotheses of LM: in particular, it defends the largely ancestral nature of humans’ conceptual-intentional apparatus and proposes a particular characterization of permissible syntactic variation, introducing a novel analysis of discourse pro-drop as part of the argument. 

Chapters 4 and 5 examine the evidence for the implication of Minimalist notions of optimality and ‘interface conditions’ in the design of the FL. In doing so, these chapters offer new suggestions regarding the motivation for lexical categories, phase-based spell-out (Chomsky 2001), and structural Case. 

Chapter 6 focuses on the status of the parser in LM, suggesting that parsing relies heavily on computationally-optimized cognition and defending a close relationship between syntactic grammar and the parser. The chapter goes on to motivate a (limited) parsing-based account of the linearisation of abstract syntactic structure and to propose an explanation for the Final-over-Final-Constraint (Biberauer, Holmberg & Roberts 2014). 

Chapter 7 suggests that we think about language acquisition as based on parsing with an over-complete grammar, rather than as determining the settings of an under-specified, defective grammar. It is suggested that diachronic evidence of ‘conservative’ acquisition (including the prevalence of grammaticalisation, “featural economy” (Clements 2003), and the gradual relaxation of the contexts for phonological rules) plausibly reflects concern for optimality in the process of acquisitional parsing. On the other hand, the prevalence of analogical forces in language change is presented as the footprint of ‘liberal’, computationally-constrained data analysis, attested in acquisitional tasks across cognitive domains. 

Chapter 8 offers an account of the evolutionary origins of non-referential, conceptually “promiscuous” lexical meaning. Finally, I suggest that the machinery grounding lexical semantics also affords our capacity for metaphorical thought, our rich theory of others, and our solipsistic nature (sometimes called ‘the human condition’); I argue that the FL is even more intimately related with what it means to be human than already assumed.
