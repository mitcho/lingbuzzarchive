for the syntax of secondary predication. Focus of the discussion will be an investigation of what

their internal structure of small clause complements must look like, how these small clause

complements connect to their matrix environments, and what the relevance could be for the

formulation of anti-locality presented here. Anti-locality is defined over a tripartite clause

structure (split into three Prolific Domains) and a PF-condition on the computation (the

Condition on Domain-Exclusivity). The investigation revolves around two leading questions: (i)

does the syntax of small clauses involve more structure than simply [SC DP XP] and (ii) do small

clauses constitute their own Prolific Domain (or maybe even more)? The results, affirmative

answers to both questions, are also relevant for other types of secondary predication.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000134/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000134<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>ZAS Papers in Linguistics 26 (87-112, 2001)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>anti-locality, prolific domains, copy spell out, minimalism, grammatical formatives, resumption, predication, small clauses, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>306 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000134">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000134">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
