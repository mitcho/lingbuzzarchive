We show that a smooth pitch lowering is disturbed in the presence of an overt complementizer for speakers who do not accept the C-t construction, which is shown with insufficient ratio of downstep. This observation applies to an individual speaker, not to an individual language. The more speakers whose pitch is difficult to lower in the presence of an overt complementizer a language contains, that language is more likely to show the C-t effect, which provides a unified account not only for why the C-t effect occurs in languages but also for why the acceptability of the C-t construction differs between the native speakers of a language. We claim that the C-t effect does not arise from syntactic ill-formedness: wh-subject extraction should be derived by the same syntactic operations for all languages, with the difference in the acceptability of wh-subject extraction attributed to whether the complementizer has phonological features or not.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007017/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007017<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Lund</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>the complementizer-trace (c-t) effect, english, swedish, finnish, downstep, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>520 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007017">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007017">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
