The study focuses on four issues: (i) the way that sentential negation is expressed syntactically, i.e. what are the syntactic properties of negative markers cross-linguistically; (ii) the occurrence of Negative Concord, i.e. the phenomenon that in many languages multiple morpho-syntactically negative elements yield only one semantic negation; (iii) the question whether imperative forms of verbs are allowed to occur in negative constructions; and (iv) the interpretation of constructions in which a universal quantifier subject precedes a negative marker: in most languages the negation then outscopes the subject.



Based on the results of Dutch diachronic, Dutch dialectological and cross-linguistic research the author shows that all these phenomena can be described in terms of typological implications. For instance, every language that bans true negative imperatives has at least a negative marker that is a syntactic head; and every language with such a negative head marker is on its turn a Negative Concord language.



The author presents a syntax-semantics interface theory of sentential negation and Negative Concord that correctly predicts these typological implications. One of the general conclusions of this study is that n-words (in Negative Concord languages) should not be thought of as negative quantifiers or negative polarity items, but that they should be considered as semantically non-negative indefinites that are syntactically marked for negation.



This study is of relevance to syntacticians, semanticists and scholars in the syntax-semantics interface, as well as to diachronic linguists, dialectologists and typologists.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000181/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000181<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Amsterdam</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>negation, negative concord, negative polarity, diachronic syntax, microvariation, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2091 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000181">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000181">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
