changes in demographics and need to adapt to meet the needs of diverse students.
Addressing this issue, this chapter argues that rural schools in the US might benefit
from distributed leadership (DLS) to meet the needs of school personnel and better
understand emergent bilingual (EB) students. The authors highlight that DLS is
likely to promote student-centered pedagogy (SCP) when the values of democratic
education are adhered to. They first map out the recent research on rural schools with
EB students and address the common challenges through big ideas from DLS. Then,
they argue why DLS is functional in grappling with these challenges and discuss
how rural schools can implement DLS efficiently. Lastly, they present pedagogical
implications for professional development with a focus on deliberative democracy
and share recommendations for future research.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005099/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005099<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>IGI Global</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>rural education; english language learners; emergent bilinguals; poverty, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>103 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005099">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005099">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
