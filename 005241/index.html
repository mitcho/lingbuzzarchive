The goal of this book is to propose and defend positions on a number of current issues in morphology and phonology using data drawn primarily from Japanese and the Ryukyuan languages. The book falls into two parts, the first dealing with the relationship between morphology and syntax and the second with the principles governing morphophonological analysis. Part I adduces evidence that roots and derivational affixes cannot be considered syntactic objects but that stems and inflectional affixes must be. In Part II, ongoing or completed diachronic change in Japanese and Ryukyuan languages provides the crucial evidence that illuminates the synchronic analytic choices of speakers with regard to morphophonology, and data from non-Japonic languages, notably Korean, Portuguese, and Modern Greek, is appealed to as well in proposing principles that can explain those analytic choices.
