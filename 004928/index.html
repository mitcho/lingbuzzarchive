In addition, I go through their comments concerning our competence as linguists, the competence of our sources, and their criticism of our data, showing that they are unjustified. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004928/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004928<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted for publication at Language </td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pirahã, obligatory control configurations, self-embedding, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1179 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004928">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004928">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
