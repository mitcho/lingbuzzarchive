The central issue here is where this NP moves to: either Spec,CP or Spec,TP. Since the widely-cited work by Heggie (1988a), there has been an extensive amount of debate revolving around this issue. The general perspective toward this debate is rather critical of the original proposal by Heggie (1988a) that the landing site in consideration is Spec,CP. The major objective of this paper is to re-examine the position by Heggie (1988a), in defence of Heggie’s Spec,CP hypothesis. The principal goal of this research direction is to argue that such a Spec,CP hypothesis is indeed theoretically viable on the grounds of a number of empirical advantages that are to be closely examined and elucidated. We consider apparent counterevidence against Heggie’s position (cf. Mikkelsen 2005) and argue that such apparent counterevidence comes from semantic ambiguities inherent to specificational sentences. Following the analysis by Nishiyama (2003) of the two readings in Japanese specificational sentences, we argue that English specificational sentences also have two readings, which accounts for the debate in the landing sites of inverse nominals in these sentences.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001970/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001970<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Unpublished</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>inverse copular constructions, specificational sentences, ambiguity, reference, focus, topic, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001970/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2013]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>623 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001970">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001970">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
