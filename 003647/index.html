We argue that "precej" and "veliko" are lexically synonymous, but their meanings are pragmatically strengthened under relevant conditions, which leads to subtle interpretative differences. Specifically, we extend Krifka’s (2007) analysis of double negatives and propose that "veliko" is assigned the stereotypical interpretation of a quantity degree word, whereas "precej" is identified with the non-stereotypical one and consequently relates to moderately big amounts. To support this claim, we report the results of an experiment involving a sentence-picture verification task, which highlight the similarities and contextually-determined differences in the use of both determiners. Our results suggest that the interpretation of "precej" is not consistent with relations in the upper part of the proportional scale and is dependent on whether or not it is in direct competition with "veliko" in the appropriate contexts. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003647/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003647<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Acta Linguistica Academica Vol. 64 (2017) 3, 435–473 (prepublication version)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>quantity determiner, slovenian, pragmatic strengthening, stereotypical interpretation, sentence-picture verification task, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003647/v2.pdf">v2 [September 2017]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003647/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2017]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>278 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003647">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003647">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
