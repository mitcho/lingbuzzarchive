Do they remain overt like finite auxiliaries, or do they disappear together with lexical verbs? Akmajian & Wasow (1975) and Sag (1976) observed the following pattern: infinitival 'have' always stays overt, while auxiliary 'being' is obligatorily elided. Infinitival 'be' and perfect 'been' are optionally elided. We provide an analysis for this pattern.
As preliminaries for our account we develop the following view on verbal inflections in English. Following Adger (2003), Bjorkman (2011) and Lasnik (1995b) we assume that auxiliaries carry uninterpretable inflectional features. Moreover, we take this to force the auxiliary to raise to the relevant inflectional head (T°, Inf°, Perf° or Prog°) for feature checking. This implies that the finite auxiliary surfaces in T° and 'have' and 'be' in Inf°. The form 'been' surfaces in Perf°, and 'being' in Prog°.
As we claim – supported by evidence from aspectual mismatches, existential constructions and idioms in English, and VPE in Taiwanese – that VPE includes the progressive projections in the ellipsis site, but nothing higher, the 'have' and 'being' data automatically fall out: 'have' is base-generated outside the ellipsis site, and 'being’s' landing site Prog° is inside of it. For 'be' and 'been', which are base-generated in the ellipsis site and raise out of it to get their inflectional features checked, we take an optional raising approach: in non-elliptical sentences raising is obligatory, otherwise the derivation crashes at PF because of unchecked features. Ellipsis contexts, on the other hand, provide the option of not raising for 'be' and 'been', because ellipsis then deletes 'be' and 'been' in their base position, with their unchecked features, avoiding the PF violation.
We extend this account to other phenomena, such as VP fronting, tag questions and pseudo-clefts. Furthermore, we speculate that the progressive projections are in fact part of the predicational chunk of the clause. This implies that the target of VPE can be characterised as the highest predicate projection of the clause, which makes VPE actually predicate ellipsis.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001609/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001609<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001609">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001609</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, ellipsis, auxiliaries, fronting, tag-questions, pseudo-clefting, predicate, progressive aspect, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001609/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2012]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1001 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001609">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001609">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
