Whorf suggested three contrasting dimensions of form variation: overt, covert, and isosemantic. Each of these three was further divided into “selective” and “modulus” categories. The need for a more flexible view of form class was also promulgated by John R. (Haj) Ross in suggesting that linguistic analysis should emphasize ‘nouniness” and “verbiness” rather than rigid form class categorization.
In this paper I will explore Whorf’s system, and Ross’ call for form class flexibility in three non-Western languages, Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic, whose morphosyntactic systems are not easily analyzed using the form classes of Indo-European languages. In Chinese, individual “words” 词 cí, can be seen simultaneously as “nouns,” “verbs,” or “adjectives.” For example the morpheme长 (cháng, zhǎng ) can be classified as a noun, a verb, an adjective or an adverb indicating “length” among numerous other meanings.
Chinese and many Japanese “compound words” generally consist of two or more character-morphemes that can be interpreted semantically as “phrases,” for example, in Chinese 买卖 (lit. buy-sell) has the meaning “business.”
Japanese has several other grammatical structures that do not fit easily into Western form class systems. One example is the “adjectival verb” ( 形容詞 keiyōshi) in which no formal distinction exists between “verbs” , and “adjectives” in that both can be “conjugated,” for example, 赤い (akaii)“red,” 赤だった (akadatta) “was red.”

Arabic has a system of differentiating form classes by creating 15 (10 in common use) separate structural categories based on triliteral consonant roots which transcend strict classification into Western grammatical form classes. The Arabic word conventionally translated as “noun” in English, سس pl. سسسسس , ism pl. asmaa’ is equivalent in function to a range of Western form classes: nouns, pronouns, adjectives , and adverbs. In most cases asmaa’ are derived from structures that also yield equivalent verbs, for example, سسسس سسسسس yaktub kitabanaan “he writes a book,” where both words are based on the same triliteral root, س س س k-t-b denoting “writing.”
In this paper I maintain that it is more accurate to look at the grammatical form classes in these non-Western languages by examining their specific functions within their respective languages rather than trying to forcibly analyze them through the lens of structures dictated by Western languages. Taking Ross’ notion of flexibility in form classes and Whorf’s more universal typological proposal, I will show how a more universal form class analysis can provide a more accurate picture of form class, one that might productively be applied to a revised analysis of Western languages as well.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006065/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006065<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Biennial Conference of the International Pragmatics Association, June 27--July 2, 2021</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>form class, morphology, grammatical categories, nouniness, verbiness, john r. ross, benjamin whorf, edward sapir, dell hymes, noun, verb, adjective, adverb, chinese, japanese, arabic, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>338 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006065">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006065">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
