(A) Linguists seek to account for speakers' knowledge of what linguistic expressions mean. This goal is typically achieved by assigning a model theoretic interpretation  in a compositional fashion. For example, "No whale flies" is true if and only if the intersection of the sets of whales and fliers is empty in the model. (B) Linguists seek to account for the ability of speakers to make various inferences based on semantic knowledge. For example, "No whale flies" entails "No blue whale flies" and "No whale flies high". (C) The well-formedness of a variety of syntactic constructions depends on morpho-syntactic features with a semantic flavor. For example, "Under no circumstances would a whale fly" is grammatical, whereas "Under some circumstances would a whale fly" is not, corresponding to the decreasing vs. increasing features of the preposed phrases. 

	It is usually assumed that once a compositional model theoretic interpretation is assigned to all expressions, its fruits can be freely enjoyed by inferencing and syntax. What place might proof theory have in this picture? This paper attempts to raise questions rather than offer a thesis. The first part is an overview and the second part elaborates on some empirical aspects of semantically flavored syntactic features.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000232/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000232<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>inference, feature, licensing, quantifier, monotonicity, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>473 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000232">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000232">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
