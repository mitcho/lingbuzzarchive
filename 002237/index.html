Second, agreement in a mono-clausal environment differs from its bi- clausal counterpart in that in a mono-clausal environment, the finite verbal element always agrees with a Nominative argument, irrespective of the ar- gument’s syntactic status, while in a bi-clausal environment agreement with Nominative appears to be optional and may be disrupted by an intervening Dative argument (Watanabe 1993; Schütze 1997; Chomsky 2000; Holmberg and Hróarsdóttir 2003; Boeckx and Hornstein 2003; Nomura 2005; Bobaljik 2008, among others).
This paper contributes to the existing discussion by proposing a new em- pirical generalization about the nature of Long-Distance Agreement (LDA), i.e., agreement which occurs in a bi-clausal environment, and its interaction with Dative interventions. Based on the new data, I argue that LDA takes place only if the intervening Dative argument undergoes independently mo- tivated A-movement to the edge of vP , be it Object Shift (Holmberg 1986; Thráinsson 2001) or Quantifier Movement (Jónsson 1996; Svenonius 2000). The core idea is that LDA arises only if v can probe the Nominative argument in the absence of the Dative argument. If the valued φ-features appear on T,
it is only via Agree between v and T. The timing of syntactic operations is crucial: I argue that it is the movement of the Dative argument which turns v into a phase head, and consequently, triggers Feature Inheritance, followed by feature matching and valuation. Thus agreement with the Nominative is obligatory whenever v is a strong phase and no Dative argument intervenes between v and Nominative when Agree takes place. Such an account in turn allows for reducing the difference between mono-clausal and bi-clausal en- vironments to an independent difference in the base-generated position of the Dative argument with respect to the probe. The analysis is further sup- ported by novel wh-movement-data that show that it is the timing, not the surface linear order of arguments, that determines agreement.
The timing pattern strongly suggests that this type of agreement is not post-syntactic (contra Bobaljik 2008). Instead, I argue that the obligatory agreement with the Nominative stems from the fact that only Nominative DPs contain a D that may be minimally searched for by the probe (Chomsky 2013) and in turn can give rise to φ-feature valuation. Quirky-case subject’s D is not accessible in the same way because of an additional structural level which separates D from the probe (Rezac 2008; Pesetsky 2013, among oth- ers).
The proposed analysis thus accounts for the Icelandic patterns in a strictly derivational and locality-based manner, without any recourse to post-syntactic operations, optionality in agreement or significant modifications in the the- ory of φ-feature Agree, thus restoring the Icelandic agreement system to normalcy.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002237/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002237<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>icelandic, agreement, long-distance agreement, locality minimal search, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2647 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002237">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002237">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
