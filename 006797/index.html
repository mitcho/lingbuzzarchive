The approach can be used in a formal semantic framework and defines concepts as mathematical objects that incorporates both extension-determining sets along with notions of similarity and typicality which have long been argued to be central to concepts. Under this view, concepts are tripartite: each concept consists of a manifold, a probability distribution over the points of the manifold, and a metric tensor to determine distances along the manifold. The manifold determines the extension of a concept over a vector space of all conceivable objects. The metric tensor quantifies the distance between objects along the manifold. This allows us to determine how similar objects are to one another qua a given concept. Finally, the probability distribution serves to define the typicality of a given object within a concept.

I apply this preliminary model to generic statements, privative modification, Frege’s puzzle and certain reasoning tasks, showing its promise in providing accounts of diverse and recalcitrant puzzles in semantics. Finally, a computational implementation of the model using a neurosymbolic approach with invertible neural networks is described.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006797/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006797<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Master's thesis, Ecole normale supérieure</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>concepts, privative adjectives, generics, reasoning, manifolds, neurosymbolic, semantics, lexical semantics, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>232 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006797">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006797">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
