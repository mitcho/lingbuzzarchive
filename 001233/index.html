In such examples the subject refers to the speaker, and not the hearer, but at the same time these examples come along with an implicature stating that the hearer would have done the same thing if s/he were in the speakers situation.

This does lead to the following two questions. First, why is it the case that a second person singular pronoun may refer to the speaker only? And, second, why is it the case that when self-referring je is used, this always comes along with an implicature of the kind described above.



In this article I address these questions by arguing that this behaviour of Dutch je is a consequence of its semantically unmarked status w.r.t. the 1st person singular pronoun ik. Along the lines of Sauerland (2008), I propose that Dutch je only carries a feature [PARTICIPANT], whereas ik carries two features: [SPEAKER] and [PARTICIPANT]. Consequently, je may in principal refer to all participants in the conversation, enabling je to refer to the speaker as well. 



The fact that je normally does not refer to the speaker but to the hearer only, must then follow as some kind of blocking effect, which I will formulate in terms of a slightly reformulated version of the Principle of Maximize Presupposition, initially proposed by Heim (1991). I will furthermore show that this principle allows overriding of such blocking effects in exactly those conversational contexts where self-referring je occurs, namely those contexts where the speaker wants to convey that what goes for him would also go for the hearer if s/he were in the situation described by the speaker.



Finally, I demonstrate that whereas jes possibility of referring to the speaker only should not be seen as a special subcase of the impersonal usage of je, its emergence is a direct consequence of the cause that triggered the emergence of the usage je as an impersonal marker as well: the loss of the impersonal pronoun men.
