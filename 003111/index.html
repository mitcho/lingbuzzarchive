This paper ponders that question in the domain of predicate-argument agreement. Specifically, I consider the two configurations under which such agreement has been proposed to take place in Minimalism: AGREE and Spec-Head. The former displaced the latter for empirical reasons: instances of long-distance agreement seem to demand it. But AGREE is obviously less constrained than Spec-Head, so it is worth asking whether this weakening of the theory is unavoidable. Alas, my conclusion will be that it is. But matters may yet get worse. For it may be that a theory with AGREE as the sole mechanism for agreement is inadequate to deal with cross-linguistic variation—Spec-Head might yet be needed as a second option.
	I focus on two phenomena where AGREE has frequently been employed: English existential 'there'-constructions and Icelandic long-distance number agreement in the presence of a quirky subject. I structure the discussion around one prominent analysis of each of these phenomena: Moro’s analysis of existentials and Koopman’s analysis of Icelandic. These are preceded by an overview of approaches to long distance agreement, and followed by a brief discussion of cross-linguistic variation, based on a proposal by Baker, and concluding remarks.
