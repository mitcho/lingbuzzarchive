In German, there is one much-discussed exception to this. In the dative masculine/neuter, a strong adjective may be followed by either a strong or a weak adjective: with good red wine may appear as (A) "mit gut-em rot-em Wein" or (B) "mit gut-em rot-en Wein". This paper reviews some of the literature on this phenomenon and points out that there are actually three dialects: (i) either both (A) and (B) are equally fine; (ii) (A) is preferred over (B); or (iii) (B) is better than (A). After critiquing Schlenkers (1999) morphological account, it is proposed that this alternation is due to a phonological rule. This discussion is then extended to indefinite pronoun constructions like "mit jemandem anderem" with somebody different, which also show a lot of variation. It is suggested that the variation on the adjective also follows from this phonological rule but that the variation on the pronoun is a reflex of "jemand" belonging to three different inflectional paradigms in the contemporary language. One of the main conclusions of the paper is that the strong/weak alternation in German is a reflex of several mechanisms.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000507/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000507<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Published in revised form in Interdisciplinary Journal for Germanic Linguistics and Semiotic Analysis 14 (2)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dps, strong/weak inflections, indefinite pronouns, german, interaction of syntax and phonology, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000507/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2007]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>874 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000507">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000507">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
