We have shown that comparison is universally performed by gradable adjectives. Gradable adjectives like "tall" and "short" differ with regard to their direction. Languages with vs. without morphemes like "-er/more" differ with regard to whether gradable adjectives encode, by default, the meaning of non-strict vs. strict inequality. Based on this understanding of comparison, we have discussed the semantic contribution of cross-linguistic particles used in comparatives, focusing on English "-er/more" and Chinese "gèng". We analyze them as two kinds of additive particles: (i) English "-er/more" is similar to "another", while (ii) Chinese "gèng" is similar to "moreover". Thus the current work also connects the notion of scalarity (or comparison along a scale with ordering) with the notion of additivity. We also briefly address the differences between Chinese "gèng" and Koran "te".
