On the one hand, they are often argued to be interpreted with respect to the time of utterance (Stump, 1985; Arregui & Kusumoto, 1998; Kubota et al., 2011). On the other hand, they are more constrained than matrix tenses, claimed to be limited to past tense when the matrix tense is past, and present when the matrix tense is future. I present evidence from the English perfect that adjunct clauses are always interpreted relative to the nearest c-commanding temporal operator, which can in principle give rise to both types of behaviors: adjunct tenses are interpreted relative to some temporal operator if within the scope of matrix tense, or they are interpreted relative to the time of utterance if they are outside the scope of matrix tense. What decides between these possibilities in a given clause are syntactic and pragmatic conditions on adjunction and the resulting interaction between the presuppositions introduced by the adjunct clause and the meanings of the temporal connectives. The result is that when the matrix clause is a non-perfect, adjunct tenses are always interpreted relative to the utterance time. When the matrix clause contains a perfect, however, adjunct tenses may be interpreted relative to the matrix tense operator.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005424/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005424<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>in review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>tense, aspect, temporal adjuncts, english, pragmatics, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>526 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005424">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005424">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
