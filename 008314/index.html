In this chapter, I critically review Piantadosi's (2023) arguments for his claim that MLMs refute rationalist theories of language along with his replies to critiques of those arguments. I argue that, throughout his paper, Piantadosi misstates the claims, predictions, and arguments of contemporary rationalist theories of language, paying particular attention to the problem of impossible languages. I further argue that the goals of rationalist theories of language and MLMs are orthogonal to each other, with the former being a scientific inquiry aimed at explanation and understanding and the latter being an engineering project aimed at making tools, and that confusing the two, as Piantadosi does, can lead one to inadvertantly take up an anti-scientific position.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008314/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008314<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Chapter in forthcoming volume, Artificial Knowledge of Language: A Linguist’s Perspective on its Nature, Origins and Use, Edited by José-Luis Mendívil-Giró. </td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>llms, ai, modern language models, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>355 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008314">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008314">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
