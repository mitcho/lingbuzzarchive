First, they can give rise to so-called non-maximal readings, in the sense that they ‘allow for exceptions’ ('Mary read the books on the reading list', in some contexts, can be judged true even if Mary didn’t read all the books on the reading list). Second, while they tend to have a quasi-universal quantificational force in affirmative sentences (‘quasi-universal’ rather than simply ‘universal’ due to the possibility of exceptions we have just mentioned), they tend to be interpreted existentially in the scope of negation (a property often referred to as homogeneity, cf. Löbner 2000). Building on previous works (in particular Krifka 1996 and Malamud 2012), we offer a theory in which sentences containing plural definite expressions trigger a family of possible interpretations, and where general principles of language use account for their interpretation in various contexts and syntactic environments. Our theory solves a number of problems that these previous works encounter, and has broader empirical coverage in that it offers a precise analysis for sentences that display complex interactions between plural definites, quantifiers and bound variables, as well as for cases involving non-distributive predicates. The resulting proposal is briefly compared with an alternative proposal by Križ (2016), which has similar coverage but is based on a very different architecture and sometimes makes subtly different predictions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003458/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003458<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>'Linguistics & Philosophy', published on-line on Nov 3, 2020</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>plural definites, plural quantification, alternatives, trivalence, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003458/v4.pdf">v4 [December 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003458/v3.pdf">v3 [November 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003458/v2.pdf">v2 [May 2017]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003458/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2017]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1464 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003458">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003458">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
