Theyare dubbed ‘bare nominals’ (BNs). BNs are often number-neutral, i.e., their number interpreta-tion does not imply any commitment to a singular or plural interpretation. In Wolof, however, BNs are singular when unmodified. This can be argued based on, e.g. the impossibility of saturating a collective predicate, on the fact that they must be referred back to with a singular pronoun, and that they cannot be the antecedent of a plural anaphor. However, a plural interpretation becomes available when a nominal-internal plural feature is exponed in the formof relative complementizer or possessum agreement. The generalization is that BNs in Wolofare singular, unless plural morphology is exponed within the nominal. I propose a version of Kalin’s (2017; 2018; 2019) framework of nominal licensing whereby certain interpretable features require licensing by the operation Agree; they are “derivational time bombs” that must be “defused” by this operation. Specifically, I argue that the feature [+plural] in Wolof nominalsfall under this category. I assume that all nominals in Wolof, bare and full, can in principlebe singular or plural. An obligatorily [+singular] interpretation arises in a BN when there isno probe to Agree with the [+plural] version, causing the derivation to crash. Conversely, if the BN merges with structure that contains a number probe, [+plural] can be defused, so that the corresponding construal can arise. This probe surfaces as relative complementizer orpossessum agreement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004922/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004922<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Accepted with revisions at Glossa</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>wolof;bare nominal, number neutrality, feature licensing, derivational time bomb</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004922/v2.pdf">v2 [March 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004922/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>526 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004922">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004922">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
