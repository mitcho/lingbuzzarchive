Den Dikken (1995) proposed that all possession structures can be derived from an underlying locative structure, extending the work of Freeze (1992). This paper argues that such a uniﬁed approach is untenable, as there are possession expressions in Icelandic which cannot be derived from locative structures. The Icelandic 'vera með' construction, translated as 'is with', provides important insight into the nature of HAVE verbs. It is argued, along the lines of Kayne (1993) and Harley (2002), that HAVE is derived from non-locative prepositions like English 'with' as in 'The man with blue eyes'. A micro-comparative investigation within Germanic supports an analysis whereby the variation in incorporation is correlated with variations in p heads. This analysis allows for a more natural account of the differences between HAVE and BE languages beyond Germanic.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001259/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001259<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Syntax (to appear in 2011)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>possession, have, incorporation, with, case, prepositions, icelandic, germanic, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>777 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001259">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001259">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
