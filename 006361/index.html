The morpho-syntactic distinction is generally taken to have semantic content or reflect a semantic mass-count distinction. At the center of the semantic mass-count distinction is, in some way or another, a notion of unity or being a single entity, the basis of countability. There is little unanimity, however, of how that notion is to be understood and thus what the semantic mass-count distinction consists in. In this paper, I will give a very general outline of existing approaches to the mass-count distinction, distinguishing between object-based, extension-based, situation-based, and grammar-based approaches. The grammar-based approach appears to meet best certain kinds of challenges that theories of the semantic mass-count distinction face. The paper will discuss existing syntactic versions of the grammar-based approach as well as two semantic versions, an ontological one as well as a novel, truthmaker-based one, both of which, though, will refrain from giving an account of unity itself.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006361/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006361<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>mass-count, classifiers, situations, ontology, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>263 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006361">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006361">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
