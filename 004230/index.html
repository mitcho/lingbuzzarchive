the types of diachronic factors that contribute to the rarity of a particular feature.
It is proposed that a number of different diachronic factors may play a role, such
as the rarity of source constructions, the rarity of particular types of change, the
number of stages necessary for a particular feature to develop, and the number
of pathways that can lead to a particular feature. This article looks at a rarissimum
of person marking, namely, a zero-marked feminine 2nd singular person
index in the Sahidic dialect of Coptic (Afroasiatic; Egypt). It is argued that such
markers are rare because they presuppose rare input structures, and most
processes of change would lead away from – rather than to – zero-marked 2SG.
Furthermore, this study identifies a diachronic process in which a PART of a
morpheme is reinterpreted as a segmentable morpheme (in this case, a person
index), thereby leading to the loss of a zero person marker. This is the converse
of the well-known “Watkins’ Law”, in which a segmentable person marker is
reinterpreted as part of a base.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004230/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004230<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Typology</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ancient egyptian-coptic, typology, diachrony, inflection, markedness, paradigm, person, rara, syntax, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>46 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004230">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004230">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
