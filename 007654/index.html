Many formal systems have been proposed to capture them, with ever-increasing complexity. This paper accounts for the same range of phenomena with a radically simpler system that we call FOL-PLUS. It extends First Order Logic (FOL) with three innovations: (i) bound variables are marked in-place with brackets, rather than appearing on their binder, e.g., "∃ ... [x] ..." instead of "∃x ... x ...", (ii) a summation operator Σxϕ combines all individuals x satisfying ϕ, and (iii) subformulas may be stored and retrieved via new, capital-letter formula labels. 

Unlike E-type approaches (Evans 1977), which pair pronouns with intuitively "salient" descriptions, FOL-PLUS formalizes the connection between all pronouns and their antecedents without requiring more and more complex, nested situation structures (Heim 1990; Elbourne 2005). And unlike dynamic approaches (Kamp 1981; Heim 1983; Groenendijk and Stokhof 1991; van den Berg 1996; Brasoveanu 2007), FOL-PLUS is completely static and relies only on a single variable assignment (as contrasted, for example, with the nondeterministic sets of sets of assignments required in van den Berg (1996)). 

The paper compares FOL-PLUS directly to these two approaches: a Heim and Kratzer (1998) style compositional translation system from natural language phrase structures into FOL-PLUS is given, allowing a direct comparison with similar E-type systems; and a formal proof is provided that FOL-PLUS has the same expressive power as existing dynamic systems. Finally, the paper introduces the notion of a discourse block, the somewhat surprising, single locus for all three FOL-PLUS innovations: the scope of bound variables, the location of summation operators, and the storage and retrieval of subformulas.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007654/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007654<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>e-type anaphora, dynamic semantics, plural dynamic logic, dynamic predicate logic, improper scope, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>102 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007654">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007654">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
