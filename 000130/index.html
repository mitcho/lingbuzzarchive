This is captured by the notion

of Discourse-Restricted Quantification (DRQ): discourse restrictions in German (and possibly other

languages, though not English) force both Wh-elements in double questions (Multiple Wh) to move to a

syntactically thematic position which is assumed to be a functional projection in an articulated CPstructure;

this projection is Top(ic)P. This movement is motivated by an underlyingly complex structure

assigned to the elements which in turn has overt realizations that can be found in (interrogative)

partitives. The movement is instantiated similarly to pre-subject scrambling, independently taken to be

topicalization. The higher Wh-topic then moves to CP in order to check the Wh-feature; the other Wh

checks its Wh-feature covertly. Evidence from a number of languages shows interesting correlations of

Wh-movement and Topicalization supporting this proposal. Semantically, the scope of multiple Whphrases

in German is subject to DRQ: the sets of referents for both Wh-elements are limited in that they

must be known to speaker and hearer. The differences between German and English will be addressed

and there is also plenty of cross-linguistic discussion. A wide range of phenomena are scrutinized here,

including (but not exclusively) Wh-adjuncts, Wh-islands and child language. The upshot is that a

conception of Wh-topics is not only more natural than one would think at first but also superior to any

other account presently made public in the minimalist literature.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000130/current.pdf?_s=WALWvunFtKqZZXCo">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000130<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000130">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000130</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Groninger Arbeiten zur germanistischen Linguistik 42 (1-60, 1998)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>multiple wh-questions, topicalization, german, superiority, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>204 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000130?_s=I63YLJ75dImm_1AO&amp;_k=_8G9FhjjG1g3H0Aw&amp;2">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000130?_s=I63YLJ75dImm_1AO&amp;_k=_8G9FhjjG1g3H0Aw&amp;3">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
