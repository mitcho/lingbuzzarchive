questions in English and Cairene Arabic (CA) using the Minimalist
Program (MP) and Optimality Theory (OT) as two opposing views
on how questions are formed and analyzed in both of these
languages.
The dialect used in this thesis, CA, is one which is discussed
briefly in the literature, only it is Egyptian Arabic (EA) that is
mentioned. There aren’t many references that mention CA and
seldom ones that mention the optionality of wh- phrases found in
it. CA as a dialect has proven to be one which is rich in it’s
analysis of question formation. The analysis of optionality of the
wh- phrase, both in MP and OT, is the contribution this researcher
is trying to provide to the academic research.
The Minimalist Program and Optimality Theory are used as the
methods of research. These two competing theories use different
approaches in describing and analyzing question formation. The
Minimalist Program relies on feature checking to account for the
movement of any element in the sentence. The uninterpretable
feature of one element, called the Probe, needs to be checked by
another element, called the Goal. A way of checking this feature
comes in the form of movement of the Goal to a position where it
can get into a checking relation with the Probe.
Optimality Theory focuses on the satisfaction of high- ranked
constraints in a typology that is language- specific. Every sentence
used grammatically in any language is the winning candidate in a
II
competition aimed at choosing that optimal form. The criterion
used is a set of constraints; these constraints are ranked in a
typological hierarchy that changes cross- linguistically. The
constraints are general and universal. If one constraint is lowranked,
it can be violated by the winning candidate and the status
of the optimal form’s integrity is not compromised. As long as the
higher- ranked constraint(s) are satisfied, then any violation of
lower- ranked constraint(s) is tolerable within standard OT
analysis.
The thesis is divided into three chapters, and a conclusion.
Chapter one is the introduction where a short history of both
theories is given along with their structure and respective
components in details. Chapter two discusses question formation in
the Minimalist Program. In this chapter, English and Cairene
Arabic are the main languages of analysis. Every type of
interrogatives in both of these languages is analyzed and trees are
drawn when needed. Examples from Iraqi Arabic and Hindi are
introduced. Chapter three begins with a detailed account of the
steps taken to achieve an OT analysis. It then discusses the
optimality- theoretic approach to question formation. Also, English
and Cairene Arabic are the main languages of analysis; tableaux of
the competitions are drawn when needed. The final section is the
conclusion where the results of this research study are provided. At
