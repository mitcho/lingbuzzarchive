Across this literature, the argument for indexical shifting is typically quite simple:
<UL> <LI> (Premise 1) Indexical n has non-utterance-based reference in embedded clause c of language L.</LI>
<LI>(Premise 2) Clause c cannot be a quote (e.g. because it is permeable to wh-movement or NPI licensing, or contains descriptions de re).</LI>
<LI>(Conclusion) Therefore, Language L allows indexical shift.
</LI></uL>
Is this form of argument valid? For many cases discussed in the recent literature: <i>only if we take 1st/2nd person agreement to always indicate that the agreement controller is actually an indexical</i>. But there is reason to doubt that premise, both from the theoretical literature (Anand 2006) and the typological/descriptive literature (Culy 1994, Curnow 2002).  Elements that may control what is canonically 1st person agreement include not only 1st person indexicals but also a class of elements I will call <em>indexiphors</em> (sometimes also called 'first person logophors').  An indexiphor is like a logophor and unlike an indexical in that it must be bound by an OP-log in the left periphery of an embedded clause; it is like an indexical in the agreement that it controls.
<P>
In this paper, I argue (following Anand 2006) that indexiphors and true shifted indexicals are both possible in natural language, with distinct empirical profiles. (E.g. indexicals but not indexiphors obey Shift Together; indexiphors but not indexicals obey De Re Blocking.) Unknotting the two takes us a significant distance toward a constrained typology of indexical shift and "shifty agreement" crosslinguistically.
