has paved the way for a successful research tradition within dynamic semantics
which has given rise to compositional analyses of a variety of projection behaviors. Since Geurts (1996), however, the promise of this research program has been called into question due to what Geurts dubs the “proviso problem”: satisfaction theory generates incorrect predictions in cases in which a presupposition ends up filtered which should not have been. I show that the satisfaction account of presupposition projection is nevertheless in good shape by revealing that the observations of Geurts are valid only under certain basic assumptions about how semantic composition works. To illustrate this, I present a satisfaction account of presupposition projection that incorporates a notion of scope-taking based on monads. The resulting composition scheme provides a setting in which the proviso problem does not arise, thus lending support to the scope theory of presupposition projection.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006801/current.html">html</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006801<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Semantics and Pragmatics 15(15). https://doi.org/10.3765/sp.15.15.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>presupposition, projection, proviso problem, monadic semantics, scope, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006801/v3.html">v3 [December 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006801/v2.html">v2 [October 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006801/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>786 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006801">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006801">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
