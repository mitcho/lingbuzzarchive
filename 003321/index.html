The goal of this article is, first, to provide empirical evidence in favour of the existence of negative events as distinct from negated events, and second, to propose a formal syntactico-semantic analysis of them that avoids the problems of Neo-Davidsonian approaches. We will argue that a framework where events lack time and world parameters and get instantiated as situations anchored to times and worlds (such as Ramchand 2014, to appear) not only accounts for the properties of negative events, but actually predicts that they should exist. We will show that an analysis of negative events as situations instantiating an event that is not initiated is enough to account for their distribution, aspectual properties and restrictions.
