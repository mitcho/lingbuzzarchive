This thesis investigates how the social circumstances of language endangerment—which include disrupted intergenerational transmission, loss of a cohesive speech community, pressure to master a new dominant language, and stigmatization of the traditional language—can have signiﬁcant grammatical effects. I investigate morphosyntactic variation among different groups of speakers of the highly endangered polysynthetic indigenous language Chukchi, which is spoken in northeastern Russia.

In order to systematically compare linguistic patterns among speakers of different backgrounds (proﬁcient older speakers, attriting speakers, and young L2 or heritage learners), I utilize a combination of traditional ﬁeldwork techniques and controlled experimental production tasks. I focus on several distinct reﬂexes of the encoding of argument structure, which cuts across multiple morphosyntactic domains and thus affords us the opportunity to examine not only individual grammatical changes due to language shift, but also system-wide grammatical restructuring that can only be seen as a direct result
of the modern sociolinguistic setting.

Modern Chukchi speakers evidence variation across the following domains: agreement marking, morphological and syntactic ergativity, valency-changing derivational morphology, verbal and nominal incorporation, and argument drop. While older, highly proﬁcient speakers display patterns that are largely consistent with existing grammatical descriptions, attriting speakers and L2 speakers show deviations from the expected patterns, though not always in identical ways. Attriting and L2 speakers reanalyze agreement marking across different dimensions, and while both groups make little productive use of verbal derivation and incorporation, this tendency is more pronounced among L2 learners. However, these varieties are alike in that the changes present in the grammars of these speakers are entirely consistent with cross-linguistic tendencies and a shift away from a polysynthetic conﬁguration. Furthermore, while similar changes in other moribund languages have often been characterized as "linguistic loss," the Chukchi data show that as certain features are lost, speakers innovate new patterns to replace them, often making use of existing resources in the language (rather than borrowing from or replicating patterns in the contact language).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005795/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005795<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Chicago Doctoral Dissertation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language shift, chukchi, polysynthesis, ergativity, morphosyntax, language contact, languages of siberia, heritage languages, attrition, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>813 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005795">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005795">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
