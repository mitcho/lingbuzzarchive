Based on experimental evidence, it shows that the two prosodic phenomena, word stress and phrasal prosodic targets, differ both in their location and acoustic means that their expression relies on. The results provide evidence in favor of fixed initial stress, cued by greater duration of the stressed syllable, as compared to subsequent ones. They also attest to the presence of a phrasal intonational F0 target on the penultimate syllable. The paper, therefore, illustrates the workings of the two separate prosodic modules, which have been commonly lumped together, leading to contradictory descriptions of Georgian prosody. Additionally, it shows that disyllabic prefixes are extrametrical for the purposes of stress assignment. In terms of their theoretical significance, these results help account for the facts related to word stress, phrasal intonation, and their interplay in Georgian, the object of numerous debates in the literature. They also demonstrate that the effects of word-level and phrase-level prosody can be teased apart, even in a language in which their interaction is rather complex.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005421/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005421<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>georgian, f0, word stress, phrasal prosody, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>266 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005421">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005421">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
