In particular, One hypothesis suggested in previous work states that vague expressions should be associated with informality and precise expressions with formality. We introduce a novel corpus measure, the SOLT, to quantify formality of an expression and show that it correlates well with established data on formality. We then apply the SOLT to numerical and quantificational expression to test the hypothesis that vagueness and informality are related. We find that there is some support for the hypothesis, but the relation is not straightforward as claimed.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006074/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006074<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>numerals, quantifiers, vagueness, formality, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>223 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006074">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006074">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
