All of these approaches share at least one intuition, the idea that sets of syntactic and semantic features create a range of possible cells or slots in which particular items can appear, and that blocking occurs when one such cell is occupied by one form as opposed to another. Beyond these similarities, there are two primary dimensions along which accounts to blocking differ: (1) the size of the objects that compete with one another (morphemes, words, phrases, sentences); and (2) whether or not ungrammatical forms are taken into consideration in determining the correct output (relatedly, whether otherwise well-formed objects are marked ungrammatical by competition). We argue that blocking in the sense of a competition for the expression of syntactic or semantic features is limited to the insertion of the phonological exponents of such features (the Vocabulary Items of Distributed Morphology) at terminal nodes from the syntax. There is thus no blocking at the word level or above, and no competition between grammatical and ungrammatical structures. The architectural significance of these points is emphasized throughout the discussion.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000262/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000262<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>architecture, blocking, competition, distributed morphology, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>333 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000262">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000262">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
