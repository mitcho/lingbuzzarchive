The argument is based on mixed gender agreement in Russian, when a grammatically masculine noun can trigger feminine agreement if its referent is female (Mučnik 1971, Pesetsky 2013). Mixed agreement is grammatical only in those forms where a regular nominal exponent is syncretic to an exponent of a declension class that includes feminine nouns. In other forms, conflicting masculine and feminine gender features lead to ineffabiliaty in morphology (cf. Schütze (2003), Asarina (2011), Coon & Keine (2020)). Ineffability arises because the Subset Principle (Halle 1997) that holds between features of a vocabulary item and a terminal at the point of  Vocabulary Insertion is violated later in the derivation. This is in turn possible if Vocabulary Insertion that applies cyclically bottom-up (Bobaljik 2000) is interleaved with Lowering that alters structure below the triggering node (Embick & Noyer 2001). Finally, I show that Russian also has a number of cases where conflicting gender features in a noun phrase do not result in a realization failure (Iomdin 1980). The difference between these patterns is derived in a principled way and follows from the positions where conflicting features are introduced.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006086/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006086<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>declension class, gender, mixed agreement, morphological ineffability, feature conflicts, syncretism, russian, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>408 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006086">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006086">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
