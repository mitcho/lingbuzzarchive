We are thus presented with two mysteries. The first concerns the structures and processes themselves. The second concerns the mechanism that hides them, and the reason for hiding them. I propose here a complete, coherent theory of the human being under a fractal-cascade system. The fundamental mechanism of the human being consists of discrete symbols attached to the branches of a repeatedly bifurcating fractal tree. This mechanism alone is enough to generate the equation, and, when modified into an asymmetrical condition, the common sentence. Much of our subjective experience is a matter of internally generated categories acting as perceptual substitutes for physical events, as when sensations of color replace wavelengths of light in experience. Thus power-of-assertion is a perceptual replacement for the symmetry of the fundamental fractal, while sense-of-truth-and-falsity is a perceptual replacement for the symmetrical or asymmetrical relationship between the symbols attached to its two sides. Technology is a re-enactment, in physical terms, of the sentence — transforming one image into another. The use of the mind’s eye in technology is a mobilization of the physics and geometry represented by the equation. The human being emerged when the sentence invaded voluntary animal actions, transforming them into proxy sentences. Sense-of-purpose is a perceptual replacement for power-of-assertion in deliberate action; and sense-of-right-and-wrong is a replacement for sense-of-true-and-false. Through cascades of perceptual replacement, then, meaningful experience is generated, starting from the remote and abstract, but basic properties of symmetry and discreteness.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002449/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002449<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cognitive Critique UMN 8:23-35</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>human, language, mind, wigner, technology, brain, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1932 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002449">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002449">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
