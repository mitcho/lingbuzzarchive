though that may be true in every respect, yet a twenty year running study of the tagalog language now suggests that it is a very finite number of sentences that are being strung up in infinite ways. and that it is the same limited set of sentences for any language. the result comes by way of a mathematically inspired study of tagalog verbs that appears to organize them all by their meanings into no more than 4,096 different sets of synonymous verbs, perfectly mapped onto a logical array of columns and rows, like a grid. all in all, the tagalog grid makes available to us an unexpected body of evidence in tagalog, by way of english, that would seem to explain a great deal about the mysteries of language in general and how the brain probably does the work of it, producing and comprehending it in its great detail and variety. edge scientists working today on language and the brain continue to wonder how it all works. how is the brain organized, and how do language and knowledge come out of it? this study will suggest that the grid is the missing link, and that it has everything to offer in the way of this quest. it is empirical work all the way and the attentive lay reader may find himself turning into an expert along the way. to the experts, i daresay that if ever a serendipity was, or a deus ex machina, or a holy grail found, you might find the grid may be the real thing. technically, what the tagalog grid presents is an actual systematic deconstruction of language into a digital array of countable semantic elements. the grid does to language what has never been tried before. it has broken it down into its meanings until one actually gets to the bottom of things.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002823/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002823<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Philippines</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>cognitive semantics, computational linguistics, neurolinguistics, philosophy of language, natural language processing, lexicography, translation, artificial intelligence, tagalog grammar</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002823/v2.pdf">v2 [January 2016]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002823/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>654 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002823">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002823">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
