I argue that the ``anti-reflexive'' reading is not triggered by the presence of a subject PRO or pro, but rather by the absence of reflexive marking, i.e. overt marking that functions to recode lexically specified co-reference relations between the arguments of a predicate. I argue that nominalizations and participles are structurally fairly rich, and that the relation between ``full'' verbs and nominalizations and participles is fairly transparent. I further argue that the verb-phrase needs to be decomposed into at least two subparts/subevents and that each sub-event carries information about the participants involved in it (as in e.g. Pustejovsky 1995 and Ramchand 2008).  I will further argue that there basically is no difference between using a reflexive pronoun to create a reflexive reading and using a reflexive pronoun to form an anti-causative reading -- it's all about re-coding the co-ference relations between the arguments of a predicate. The article also shows that phenomena like participle formation, nominalizations and argument ``reduction'' can all be handled in the syntax if we follow the so-called superset principle of lexical insertion. No generative lexicon is therefore needed. This article focuses on data from Swedish, but comparisons will be made with English.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000960/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000960<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to be published in Relating to Reflexives, working paper volume</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>nominalizations, participles, reflexives, anaphora, superset principle, nanosyntax, morphology, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000960/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2009]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>924 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000960">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000960">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
