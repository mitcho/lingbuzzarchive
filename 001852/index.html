Here we test the model of Yang (2000, 2002) on the historical case of the loss of verb movement to Tense (V-to-T) in Faroese and Mainland Scandinavian, using quantitative data from a number of corpora. We show that the model straightforwardly predicts the historical data, given minimal and uncontroversial assumptions about Scandinavian syntax. In contrast to a number of previous attempts to explain this repeated pattern of change, it is not necessary to appeal to any bias against learning structures involving V-to-T---a welcome result, given current evidence from acquisition. The newer V-in-situ parameter setting overcomes the original V-to-T grammar because it is more learnable in a language that also has embedded verb-second (EV2). Finally, we argue that the course of the diachronic change is evidence against a strong version of the "Rich Agreement Hypothesis" (RAH), but that under this account the stability of V-to-T in Icelandic provides evidence for the weaker version (cf. Bobaljik 2002).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001852/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001852<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Comparative Germanic Linguistics (pre-pub version)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language change, acquisition, syntax, diachronic syntax, quantitative, icelandic, germanic, scandinavian, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>581 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001852">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001852">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
