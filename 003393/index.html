This generalization, however, is challenged by Wagner’s (2006) observations with the NPI-licenser only: although an only-clause is (Strawson) downward-entailing in its unfocused part, NPIs are not necessarily licensed there. In particular, DP- only does not license an NPI that appears within the unfocused part of its left argument (as seen in *Only a chair of any HUMANITIES department met with the president), and VP-only does not license an NPI if this NPI and the focused item appear within the same island (as seen in *The president only met with a chair of any HUMANITIES department). These observations suggest that the licensing status of an NPI in an only-sentence is not just determined by the polarity pattern of the environment where this NPI gets interpreted.


To explain Wagner’s (2006) observations, I argue that only is not just an NPI-licenser but also an “NPI-unlicenser.” Following Chierchia (2006, 2013), I assume that an NPI carries a domain feature [D] which activates domain alternatives, and that an NPI is unlicensed if exhaustifying its domain alternatives yields a contradiction. I further propose that only can check off the [D] feature of an NPI that appears within its syntactic argument. If the argument of only is downward- entailing with respect to an NPI, using only to check off the [D] feature of this NPI would return an inference that contradicts the prejacent presupposition and make this NPI unlicensed. In the case of VP-only association, if an NPI is not focused and doesn’t appear within a focus-contained island, the contradiction can be avoided by F-movement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003393/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003393<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Semantics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>focus, focus movement, only, negative polarity item, alternative semantics, grammatical view, implicatures, exhaustification, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>531 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003393">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003393">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
