Rappaport Hovav 1995), constructionalist (e.g. Goldberg 1995), or
syntactic (e.g. Borer 2005) share the assumption that verb meanings
decompose into an event template defining the broad temporal and
causal structure and an idiosyncratic root filling in real world
details about the event. While it is a common assumption that these
two classes of meanings are "bifurcated" (Arad 2005, Embick 2009,
Dunbar & Wellwood 2016), so that templatic meaning is only introduced
by the template and never by the root, this question has never been
put to empirical test. This paper examines the semantic and
morphological predictions of this hypothesis focusing on the roots of
change of state verbs and derivatives of them. It shows that there are
two distinct classes of roots --- roots from which descriptively
deadjectival verbs are derived (the "flat" class) and roots from which
descriptively monomorphemic verbs are derived (the "crack"
class). Contradiction tests, sublexical modification, and
circumstantial evidence from morphological typology show that while
the former class behaves consistent with bifurcation, the latter does
not; instead the roots themselves seem to carry an entailment of
change of state, otherwise a templatic entailment. A formal analysis
assuming this is provided that explains the different behavior of the
two root classes. Thus the conclusion is that contrary to bifurcation,
some roots do introduce templatic meaning, consistent with independent
findings that there are entailments of possession in the roots of some
ditransitives (Beavers & Koontz-Garboden 2016) and causation in the
roots of manner of killing verbs (Beavers & Koontz-Garboden
2012). This is ultimately argued to be a consequence of the nature of
certain kinds of idiosyncratic root meanings, which may entail some
templatic meanings as inescapable parts of their definitions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003035/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003035<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In press in Brendel, Cole, Aaron Kaplan, Abby Kaplan, Miranda McCarvel, Jeff Pynes, and Ed Rubin (Eds.).
