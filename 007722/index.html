The traditional formulation of BL posits that Proto-Indo-European *o became Indo-Iranian /ƒÅ/ in open syllables and /a/ elsewhere, positing a purely phonological context of application. Alternatively, Kiparsky (2010) has argued for a revised version of BL in which the accent and ablaut properties of the affected forms play a role, hence essentially for a synchronic morphophonological rule. I argue that this revised version fails both from the perspective of comparative reconstruction and as a synchronic rule based on a detailed study of the forms cited as evidence for the revised rule. Rather, in order to identify inherited *o in Indo-Iranian the effects of the "blind" Neogrammarian rule must be separated from the synchronic morphological rules of the attested languages. This paper thus makes a methodological contribution in defense of the Neogrammarian approach to sound change, but also an empirical contribution by showing that this approach, in combination with a strictly lexical definition of analogy, can account for some conspicuous exceptions to traditional BL.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007722/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007722<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Transactions of the Philological Society, Nov. 2023, https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-968X.12272</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sound change, neogrammarian hypothesis, morphophonological &amp; morpholexical change, analogy, leveling, regularity of sound change, comparative reconstruction, indo-iranian, vedic, avestan, proto-indo-european, morphology, phonology, diachrony</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>410 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007722">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007722">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
