We compiled an audio-based intelligibility test consisting of three components: a word test where the respondents were asked to perform a semantic classification task with 11 semantic categories; a sentence test where the task was to provide a translation of a sentence into the respondent’s native language and a text test where a short text was listened to twice and the respondents were asked to answer 8 multiple-choice questions. We collected data from 24 respondents in Malta, Tunis and Benghazi which we analyzed to determine that there exists asymmetric mutual intelligibility between the two mainstream varieties of Maġribī Arabic and Maltese, where speakers of Tunisian and Libyan Arabic are able to understand about 40% of what is being said to them in Maltese, whereas that ratio is about 30% for speakers of Maltese exposed to either variety of Arabic. Additionally, we found that Tunisian Arabic has the highest level of mutual intelligibility with either of the other two varieties. Combining the intelligibility scores with comparative linguistic data, we were able to sketch out the phonological variables involved in enabling and inhibiting mutual intelligibility for all three varieties of Arabic and set stage for further research into the subject.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002930/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002930<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Folia Linguistica (to appear 2016)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>maltese, tunisian arabic, libyan arabic, mutual intelligibility, functional testing, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1683 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002930">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002930">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
