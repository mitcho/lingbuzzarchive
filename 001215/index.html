We first elaborate on Haegeman (2002), who challenges this claim and we show on the basis of attested data and corpus data that sentence-medial PPs are grammatical, though perhaps relatively infrequent. We then proceed to highlight a context in which medial position is preferable to final position, namely when a PP containing a negative component takes sentential scope: while non-negative PPs favour final position over medial position, negative PPs favour medial position over final position. 

We take these distributional data as support for claims to the effect that there is a canonical medial position dedicated to the encoding of sentential negation and that the negative PPs in medial position directly encode sentential negation. Though the distribution of negative PPs in English is reminiscent of the distribution of n-words in the other Germanic languages, which we illustrate with West Flemish and Norwegian data, the similarity is deceptive in that while final position for the negative PP adjuncts is highly degraded in some clause types in English, and remains acceptable in others, final (extraposed) position is categorically excluded in the other Germanic languages. We speculate that the degraded status of the final negative constituent in Germanic is to be attributed to a grammatical factor, while the degraded status of PP adjuncts in English should perhaps be attributed to an effect of increased processing cost (cf. Huddleston and Pullum 2002).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001215/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001215<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>adjunct, pp, mid position, grammaticality, negation, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>219 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001215">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001215">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
