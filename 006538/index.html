This paper suggests that this change is part of a cycle, where the pronoun-self compounding is a stage of renewal. The proposal is based on (i) etymological studies of Indo-European languages, showing that intensifiers like Germanic self and Latin ipse reveal traces of earlier cycles of compounding with a pronominal element; (ii) typological surveys relating complex reflexives, simple reflexives and middle morphology in a cyclic process; and (iii) historical research from Semitic languages, showing that the meaning of body-part expressions has evolved from the lexical source to reflexive meaning to intensifier. Reduction is shown to proceed in two paths corresponding to the distinct prosodic patterns exhibited by reflexives and intensifiers, resulting in verbal morphemes or zero anaphora in the former case, and heavier focus particles in the latter. The analysis places reflexivity on a par with other cyclic processes in language change, and explains the cross-linguistic variation in reflexive strategies, where different forms such as Arabic nafs-x, English x-self, French se-, zero anaphora, German selbst etc. correspond to different stages in the cycle.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006538/current.docx">docx</a> ][ <a href="/lingbuzz/006538/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006538<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>reflexive anaphors, intensifiers, cyclicity, historical syntax, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>320 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006538">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006538">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
