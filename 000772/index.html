While two recent analyses argue that this is because gradable adjectives in Mandarin are of the wrong semantic type to combine directly with a subject, this paper presents data casting doubt on such an approach: it is shown that overt degree morphology is obligatory only when the adjective is the entire predicate of a matrix-level, declarative clause. Taken together with independent research uncovering a link between aspect and assertion in Mandarin event-denoting predicates, it is argued that matrix-level assertions in Mandarin are headed by a complementizer which is phonologically null but which requires support in the form of an overt VP-external functional head: when the predicate is event-denoting, aspectual morphology typically provides this support, and when the predicate denotes a gradable state, degree morphology can be used instead. This requirement is formalized in terms of syntactic agreement, suggesting that agreement exists as a strategy for formally marking declarative clauses, in addition to the previously attested cross-linguistic strategies of head movement (e.g., Germanic V2) and base generation of a dedicated declarative complementizer (e.g., Korean _-ta_).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000772/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000772<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under review for publication</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>mandarin chinese, clause typing, illocutionary force, assertion, gradable adjectives, degree, aspect, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1084 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000772">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000772">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
