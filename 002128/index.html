Kuhn 2014 argues that this analysis fails in two cases. (i) First, loci sometimes appear to be inherited through agreement rather than directly interpreted, in particular in those environments in which phi-features are known to remain uninterpreted (= 'Kuhn's Generalization'). (ii) Second, there are cases in which one and the same locus can refer to different individuals, in contradiction with the predictions of the standard theory. Kuhn concludes that sign language loci are an open class of features rather than of variables; and he provides a variable-free treatment of them, although without accounting for their deictic uses. While granting the correctness of Kuhn's Generalization, we offer an alternative in which loci are both features and variables: some loci (in particular deictic ones) obtain their value from an assignment function, and introduce presuppositions on the value of other (covert) variables; but loci are also subject to the same rules of agreement as phi-features, and thus remain uninterpreted in other environments. Finally, we argue that spoken languages also have expressions that are featural while also containing a variable element.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002128/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002128<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002128">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002128</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Natural Language and Linguisitic Theory</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>features, variables, loci, sign language, agreement, binding, focus, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002128/v9.pdf">v9 [November 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002128/v8.pdf">v8 [August 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002128/v7.pdf">v7 [July 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002128/v6.pdf">v6 [February 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002128/v5.pdf">v5 [February 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002128/v4.pdf">v4 [September 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002128/v3.pdf">v3 [September 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002128/v2.pdf">v2 [July 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002128/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3132 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002128">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002128">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
