'Aspirational' means that unlike the case in proof theory, where logicians actually know what proofs they want to treat as equivalent, in linguistics we are speculating about computations whose nature is largely unknown to use, but we can nevertheless make some educated guesses about aspects of their organization.  Elaborating Marr's levels somewhat further along the lines proposed by Christoper Peacocke and Martin Davies (level 1.5), I suggest calling this 'explanation at level 1.6'.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006117/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006117<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Modular Design of Grammar.
