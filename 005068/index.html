We show that tone sandhi systems triggered purely by phonetic environment are overwhelmingly uni-directional (i.e. structurally simple), regardless of their phonetic naturalness. Crucially, uni-directionality is largely right-dominant, which could be attributed to the left toneâ€™s inability to bear contour tones. We argue that for the purely phonetic tone sandhi, the patterns tend to be structurally simple, keeping a uni-direction, but the directionality is phonetically grounded, preferring right-dominant patterns. When tone sandhi systems are sensitive to grammatical categories, there is a strong structural bias towards keeping a single direction for each grammatical category, supporting the structural simplicity hypothesis. We show that our tone sandhi analysis incorporating the structural simplicity and the phonetic naturalness can better account for sandhi patterns which were argued to lack phonetic or cognitive motivation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005068/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005068<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted for review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>tone sandhi, structural simplicity, phonetic naturalness, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>285 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005068">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005068">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
