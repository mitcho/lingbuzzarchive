The accents were distinguished by F0 height and shape. The data also exhibited cue trading between F0 and duration, as well as systematic context-driven variation and general variability which led to category overlap comparable to that reported for vowel contrasts. These findings indicate that intonation categories are more similar to segmental categories than previously thought, supporting the view that the study of intonation phonetics and phonology should follow the same principles as the study of segments.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007681/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007681<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>The Netherlands</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>intonation, variability, variation, f0, functional principal component analysis, cue trading, category overlap, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>359 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007681">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007681">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
