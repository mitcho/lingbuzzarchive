As the abstract suggests, it aims at a rapprochement between generativist and functionalist approaches to Vietnamese phrase-structure.


In all likelihood, this talk will please no one: functionalists are unlikely to be persuaded by the need for any of the formal principles introduced here, while generativists may be equally averse to a theory that runs "from intention to articulation" (Levelt 1989), that treats LF as a universal, pre-syntactic, level of representation - the input to syntax - and which draws greater inspiration from Slobin's (2000, 2003) "Thinking for Speaking" hypothesis than from recent advances in generative theory (post 2000).

Nevertheless, there may be some non-aligned linguists for whom this paper is of interest.


"In this paper, I try to make a case for understanding Vietnamese phrase structure in terms of universal syntactic principles, introducing the framework of generative typology. This approach can be viewed as offering a rapprochement between conventional formalist vs functionalist research paradigms: whilst adopting several core mechanisms of mainstream generativism, including especially a syntactic construal of scope relations (“c-command”), the approach nevertheless shares with functionalist approaches the idea that underlying phrase structure is largely shaped by the meaning that speakers intend to convey. This thought experiment uses examples drawn from a variety of typologically distinct languages, with a focus on Predicate-Initial (‘VSO’) languages, Modern Irish, in particular."<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007665/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007665<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Conference proceedings (International conference "Modern trends in linguistics: Theory and applications", Hanoi, Nov-Dec 2023)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>vietnamese grammar, typology, scope and constituency, predicate-initial languages, alternatives to functionalism, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>210 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007665">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007665">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
