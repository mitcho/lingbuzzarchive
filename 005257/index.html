However, in
certain cases agreement may appear non-finally. Furthermore, in certain
dialects, and in colloquial speech, agreement may appear both finally and
non-finally, yielding doubling. Previous accounts do not consider double
agreement, and therefore are explanatorily inadequate. This paper proposes
an account in which medial agreement is derived via reduplicating a string of
morphemes that includes agreement, followed by deletion of some of the
duplicate or original morphemes. While medial agreement involves
reduplication plus deletion of one of the occurrences of agreement, I claim
that double agreement involves reduplication but without deletion of the base
or the reduplicant of agreement. My account is an adapted version of the
morphological metathesis accounts that were proposed for double agreement
in Spanish (see Mare 2018 for an overview).
