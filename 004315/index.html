This is the division which made the whole analysis of the Hawaiian base words possible. Also important was the division of these words into three groups: one group with initial voiceless consonants /‘,h,k,p/, the second group with initial voiced sonorants /l,m,n,w/, and last group without an initial consonant at all. Although the last is a small group of eight words it shows that in this language (and comparison to other Polynesian languages supports this) there are words composed of only vowels and diphthongs without an initial consonant. These eight words in Hawaiian are composed of only long [grave] vowels /o/, /u/, and /a/ and their diphthongs ai, ao, au, oi, ou. This group stresses the quite essential role of vowels in this language.
