These days I have been reading some of your recent contributions: comments on Facebook and Twitter, several blogposts and interviews from your blog (dlc.hypotheses.org), including one that you kindly made with me (dlc.hypotheses.org/1595), and a recent paper (Haspelmath 2020). In these contributions you evaluate the scientific adequacy of Generative Grammar (GG), especially in comparison with the functional comparative approach that you defend. My feeling is that there is a central misunderstanding about the scientific nature of GG that limits the scope of your conclusions: You assume that GG and functional linguistics offer alternative or competing answers to the same questions, when the truth is that they arise different questions, because they are approximations with different objectives, different methodology and, above all, different objects of study. Therefore, I believe that your evaluation of the merits of GG is inadequate. I will try to explain why in some detail in this letter, but the essential idea is that you are judging GG as if it were oriented to the same objectives as the functional comparative approach, and this is incorrect. You are right that GG is not useful for your scientific interests, but thatâ€™s not GG's fault.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005075/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005075<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>https://wordpress.com/view/philosophyoflinguistics618680050.wordpress.com</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>generative grammar, universal grammar, language universals, language description, typology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005075/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>407 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005075">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005075">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
