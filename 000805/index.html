FOFC is a generalization over a striking asymmetry in the attested/grammatical word orders of the Worlds languages: a head-initial phrase cannot be (immediately) dominated by a head-final phrase.  Diverging from the analysis of Biberauer, Holmberg & Roberts (2007, 2008), I propose that FOFC is a direct effect of linearization, derived from a version of Kaynes (1994) Linear Correspondence Axiom (LCA) without its induction step (Uriagereka 1999) coupled with a variant of Chomskys (1995) Bare Phrase Structure (BPS).

It is proposed that if head-finality is derived via movement, as Holmberg (2000) Biberauer, Holmberg & Roberts (2007, 2008) propose, following Kayne (1994), then FOFC is really a restriction on specifiers, and as such it might result from the familiar linearization challenge which the latter pose. It is claimed that there are two distinct ways to linearize a complex specifier with respect to the clausal spine: (i) Multiple Spell-Out (Uriagereka 1999), (ii) Complement Stranding. The second possibility only applies where a non-linearized, head-initial phrase moves from a complement position.  In such cases the complement of this complex phrase gets stranded in its base-generated position to enable linearization. (i) derives CED effects and (ii) finds support from discontinuous constituents of various kinds as well as from the gap described by FOFC: if head-finality is derived by comp-to-spec movement then FOFC can actually be seen as a further instance of the same effect.

The crucial claims are: (i) that terminals define their own c-command domains via BPS, with the phrasal label counting as an instance of the projecting head; (ii) that the equivalent to X-bar levels are inert in terms of c-command; (iii) that there is no induction step stating that if X c-commands Y then everything dominated by X precedes Y;  and (iv) that copy-deletion is subject to last resort, so that the need for a total linear order of terminals affects which copies are targeted by PF.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000805/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000805<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted to Newcastle Working Papers in Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>lca, disharmonic, scattered deletion, linearization, directionality, pf, fofc, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000805/v3.pdf">v3 [May 2009]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000805/v2.pdf">v2 [December 2008]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000805/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2008]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>714 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000805">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000805">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
