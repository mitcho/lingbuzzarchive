Croft 2001; Langacker 1987; Aarts 2007). It argues that argumenthood is not wholly a property of a lexical head predicate and that a purely lexically based projectionist approach to syntactic argument structures cannot be maintained. It also explores the effect that the interplay between relevant properties of locatives has on their recruitability as arguments, and a novel argument-index analysis is proposed as a means to distinguish adjuncts from arguments. The analysis makes use of both general and language- specific morphosyntactic and morphosemantic tests.                                             
    Investigation of locative-related roles reveals that certain properties determine their status in the argument-adjunct continuum: thematic, individuated and animate locatives are moreargument-like than non-thematic, inanimate and general deictic locatives (in line with Kittilä2007, 2008; Peterson 2007). Interplay between these properties is shown to affect argument recruitment in Balinese, based on the value of the argument index for a given locative-relatedrole. More generally, there also is evidence that languages vary in whether they allow true adjuncts to be recruited as arguments at all<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005744/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005744<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Discovery</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>355 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005744">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005744">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
