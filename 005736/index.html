Instead, I support the hypothesis that verbs’ meaning emerges as a result of the syntactic structure in which they are merged and that the role of lexical items/roots reduces to their idiosyncratic encyclopedic content. These two assumptions are executed via adopting the proposal that splits the traditional VP structure into two main functional heads, namely VoiceP and vP, and via endorsing the architectural assumptions advanced in the framework of Distributed Morphology. The main empirical support to this claim comes from verbs that appear in syntactic structures that are not in consonance with their semantic-conceptual content, Arabic varieties that lost their vocalic melodies that otherwise encode thematic roles, and spray-load alternation. This paper concludes by exploring language-particular processes whose non-applicability goes beyond morphology, the analysis of which supports the role of the Encyclopedia. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005736/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005736<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Macrolinguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>vp structure; minimalist program; distributed morphology; argument structure; standard arabic; moroccan arabic; unaccusative/unergative verbs; roots; encyclopedia., syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005736/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>836 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005736">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005736">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
