For this purpose, we conducted an experimental study in which German, French and English adjective-noun/noun-adjective combinations (e.g. Jungtourist, jeune touriste, YOUNG tourist, young TOURist) were tested with respect to how well they were memorized. Using existing nouns (e.g. Architekt, architecte, architect) as a baseline, we found evidence that the German AN constructions under investigation exhibit a memorization advantage in comparison to the French AN/NA constructions. We attribute the effect to the compound status of the German constructions as well as their morphological origin, in contrast to the syntactic source of the French constructions. For the English constructions, we considered stress (YOUNG tourist vs. young TOURist) to be a determining factor, which we hypothesized to interact with semantic compositionality. This interplay was examined in a second study, which revealed that non-compositional structures with initial stress (e.g. HARD shirt) gave rise to compound-like effects in comparison to the phrase-like compositional constructions with non-initial stress (e.g. short BRUSH). In conclusion, we argue for a cognitively grounded distinction between word-formation and syntax, where memorization has turned out to be a suitable test environment.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002770/current.pdf">pdf</a> ][ <a href="/lingbuzz/002770/current.file">file</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002770<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002770">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002770</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted to SKASE Journal of Theoretical Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>compounds, phrases, memorization, mental lexicon, lexicalism, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002770/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>296 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002770">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002770">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
