This assumption is mainly based on syntactic criteria. However, it has long been understood that prosodic phrasing in general and Intonation Phrase boundary placement in particular is not determined by syntactic constituency alone. Instead, other syntactic, prosodic, semantic and pragmatic factors play a role, too. Moreover, we know that the intonational features of parentheticals depend on their syntactic, prosodic and pragmatic properties. It would therefore be surprising if the intonational phrasing of parentheticals were a result of syntactic constituency alone. 

This paper reports the results of a prosodic analysis of a large set of spoken corpus data. It shows that clausal/ sentential parentheticals and non-restrictive relative clauses may depart from the commonly assumed prosodic separation in various ways. The observed intonational patterns are often motivated by well-studied prosodic constraints, as well as pragmatic principles. The results serve as evidence for a syntactic analysis of parentheticals which allows for a hierarchical relation between parenthetical and host. They can best be explained in a prosodic theory that assumes more than one level in the phonological component of the grammar and allows for an interface between phonology/ phonetics and pragmatics.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000713/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000713<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in: Journal of Linguistics 45 (2009)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>parentheticals, prosodic phrasing, prosodic theory, phonology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000713/v2.pdf">v2 [October 2008]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000713/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2008]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>539 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000713">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000713">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
