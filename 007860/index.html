Shifting the level of analysis to functional purpose allows a simple unified and explanatory account of diverse phenomena to obviate complex accounts involving a disjunction of unintegrated processes. This analysis explains why reflexives should exist in natural languages.

What is reflexivity? To supplement accounts confined to how it might be rationally generated in a syntactic module lacking inputs, we ask: What is it for and why does it exist? We find a system of structured logical psychological linguistic actions for efficiently managing uncertainty. This complements structural analyses per the seminal work of (Chomsky, 1981) which continue through the present to wider generative treatments extended to exempt/logophoric phenomena. (Dana Cohen, 2018).

For good methodological reason, the generative paradigm for morpho-syntax has been detached in practice from a functional notion of purposeful intent, operating from a null state, lacking instigational inputs in a cognitively unstimulated mental module. This has been advantageous for enabling progress in the complex domain of human language, but the generative program does not preclude looking beyond, to connections with purposeful intent, as explicitly anticipated by (Chomsky, 1995). Recourse to structural purpose results in a more fully enabled model, referred to here as Purposeful Grammar. This offers new descriptive and explanatory insight, and encourages reintegration and interconnections within larger theories of cognition, as well as future AI models.  

We include prominent work of Cognitive Linguistic, Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar and Gricean Pragmatics for comparison and coverage of data. The PG approach excels because, for treatment of both exempt and non-exempt reflexives, it handles all cases with a simple principle of probabilistic efficiency, precluding complex configurational constraints that fail to explain the very existence of reflexives and reliance on differential description of sentence sets rather than particular sentence instigation. PG’s particular unification of exempt/non-exempt properties are exceptional and unique;

Beyond functional perspective, grammar of purpose sheds light on the underlying reasons for the theoretical utility of formal concepts such as C-Command and the Extended Projection Principle. Functional regulation of structure expands understanding of Universal Grammar to explain rapid child language learning from a paucity of data. Two goals are sought: to provide an empirically better analysis of reflexives and to give better conceptual underpinnings for generative syntax by showing the essential role of function.

We propose:
•	A simple, comprehensive and explanatory account of reflexives requires a shift in level of analysis from syntactic structural features to one of functional purpose.
•	The purpose of reflexives is to efficiently manage uncertainty in communication.
•	Speakers of a language share default statistical assumptions about more likely states in linguistic descriptions. This allows the most common to be communicated efficiently without special marking, reserved for the less usual state.
•	Reflexive markings are signals by the speaker of diversion from the default assumption/expectation  of the more likely case, to a less likely one.  It is most efficient to mark the less common state.
•	For basic reflexives, the default assumption/expectation is of no coreference.
•	For extended/exempt reflexives, the likely default assumption/expectation is varied and pertains to the marked element, but is otherwise formally explicit, relying on inference from the default assumptions that are shared among speakers.
•	Functional input supplies a simple instruction to linguistic construction processes to enact reflexive marking for non-default interpretation. This minimal interface does not require complex cognitive linguistic analysis and provides an architecture more amenable to an artificial intelligence model of sentence generation.
