Most previous approaches to ICM attempt to determine the nature of the mutations–phonological, morphological, or syntactic. The goal has been to capture these mutations in a system that explains how they operate and predicts the correct outcomes in the right environments. One piece of this puzzle that has seldomly been discussed in detail concerns the environments in which mutation unexpectedly fails to occur. In this paper I argue that the behavior of mutation in Irish genitive DPs provides evidence for a DP phase leading to the conclusion that mutation is phase-bound. That is, mutation is confined within a single syntactic phase. This paper has implications not just for mutation domains in Irish but also for the syntactic structure of the DP and the properties of syntactic phase domains.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008224/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008224<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Proceedings from the 59th Annual Meeting of the Chicago Linguistics Society (CLS 59)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phases, consonant mutation, irish, locality domains, morphology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>167 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008224">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008224">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
