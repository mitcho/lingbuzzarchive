Crucially, it has been argued to display properties  that  are  at  odds  with  the  notion  of  agreement  in  spoken  languages.  A  thorough theoretical investigation of the phenomenon may thus add to our understanding of the nature and limits  of  agreement  in  natural  language.  We  argue  against  three  approaches:  (i)  previous  non-
syntactic  gesture-based  approaches,  (ii)  hybrid  accounts  combining  syntactic  and  thematic agreement  and (iii)  analyses  that treat  agreement  markers  as  clitics.  Instead,  we  show that  sign 
language agreement is consistently syntactic agreement and that it can be accounted for by means of  mechanisms  that  have been  independently  proposed  for  spoken  language.  We  argue  that  the modality-independent syntactic account proposed in this paper is able to capture the distinction of verb types, the behavior of backwards verbs, and the use of the agreement auxiliary. However, we suggest  that  the  combination  of  mechanisms  is  modality-specific,  that  is,  agreement  in  sign language involves modality-independent ingredients, but uses a modality-specific recipe. It is the very nature of agreement in sign languages, its spatial and gestural properties, that motivates the distinction of verb types and the existence of backwards verbs, and which thus calls for an unusual combination of independently motivated mechanisms. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003644/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003644<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms. </td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sign language agreement, agree, agreement reversal, rule ordering, periphrasis, auxiliaries, analytic verb forms, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>154 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003644">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003644">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
