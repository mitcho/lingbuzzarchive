We find that one of the functions of phrasal IUs (especially with topic markers) is to introduce important information, i.e., topics, while clausal IUs tend to not introduce important information.2 We also point out that phrasal intonation units in Japanese share functions and phonetic characteristics with preposed elements in left-dislocation sentences found in many languages such as English, French, Italian, and Spanish. This paper claims that the importance as well as the givenness is crucial to understanding discourse structure and information structure although only the givenness has received much attention in the literature.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002348/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002348<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Kyoto, Japan</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>intonation unit, information structure, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>778 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002348">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002348">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
