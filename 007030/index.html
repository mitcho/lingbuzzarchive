are highly abstract. Solt (2016) suggests ways to connect such analyses to facts about the
mental representation of quantity and measure. The goal of this paper is similar in mission,
but draws on polysemy data. The English -th nouns expressing measurable dimensions
(breadth, depth, height, length, warmth, weight, width) all have uses describing measurable
properties (e.g. 2 meters in breadth/ depth / height / length / width, 2 kilos in weight, 115
degrees in warmth). However, they all have other, interestingly diverging senses. Heights and
depths are geographical formations; weights are also physical objects, if of a different sort.
None of the other measure nouns name physical objects in the absence of a complement.
Lengths of rope, breadths of sand, and widths of fabric can all describe physical objects
with a particular measure, whereas heights of poles, depths of water, and weights of yarn
only describe measures. Warmths of wood, in contrast, are neither objects nor measures,
but rather properties. I argue that these patterns can be explained by taking into account
whether the properties in question can be measured according to ratio scales, and if so, how
the "zero" value for the scale is determined; and that despite their abstractness, formal scales
do mirror cognitively salient aspects of measuring.
