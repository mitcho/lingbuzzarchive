More specifically, I contend that positing a resumptive (i.e. bound variable) pro also in English-like languages is not only theoretically appealing for various reasons (a.o. ideas in Hornstein 1999, 2001, Boeckx & Hornstein 2003, 2004, Kratzer 2009), but also empirically adequate (as conjectured e.g. in Cinque 1990). The central claim of this paper however is that resumption is restricted to (sometimes concealed) relatives. Applying this proposal to languages like English, the distinction drawn between (resumptive or bound variable) pro and trace accounts for phenomena as diverse as lack of superiority effects, lack of weak crossover in appositives, lack of Principle C effects in relative clauses, and so-called ATB movement phenomena.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000897/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000897<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Proceedings of the 35th Incontro di Grammatica Generativa</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>resumption, reconstruction, bound variables, pro, crossover, relative clauses, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000897/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2009]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>637 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000897">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000897">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
