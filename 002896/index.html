Assumptions (a) and (b) constitute Merchant’s approach to sluicing. As pointed out by Lasnik, (a) and (b) by themselves do not derive important, well-established, central properties of sluicing. Assumption (c) is intended to fix this gap in Merchant’s account. The conjunction of (a), (b), and (c) makes novel predictions not shared by competing accounts of sluicing like a Lasnik-style syntactic identity account or a Culicover-and-Jackendoff-style account with no syntax at the ellipsis site. The Bulgarian data presented here show that the specific expectations of the present account are borne out, giving it the empirical edge over its competitors.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002896/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002896<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Abels, Klaus (2017). “On the interaction of P-stranding and Sluicing in Bulgarian”.
