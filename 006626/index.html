This result is central in debates about gender-fair language but
has mostly been established using masculine generics. This paper presents two preregistered studies on French that aim to replicate this result but using a lesser-studied type of nouns: generic hybrid nouns. These nouns can refer
to both male and female individuals but are either masculine or feminine, depending on the noun (e.g. un talent ‘a talent’ and une vedette ‘a star’). The availability of both genders for hybrid nouns allows for a more comprehensive
test of the effect of grammatical gender than permitted by masculine generics. Overall, the paper replicates the role of grammatical biases in gender inferences, with masculine hybrid nouns being judged as more likely to refer to male individuals as compared to feminine hybrid nouns. However the results did not reveal a symmetric bias for feminine nouns, which were interpreted as gender-neutral. But this latter result should be interpreted with caution as it could be due to uncontrolled effects of gender stereotypes coming from the specific stimuli used in the study.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006626/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006626<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Linguistics Vanguard</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>grammatical gender; hybrid nouns; masculine generics; gender-fair language; french, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006626/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>769 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006626">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006626">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
