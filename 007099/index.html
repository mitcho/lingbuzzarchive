In section 2, I introduce data from Saurian, a Bavarian dialect spoken in a speech island in Northern Italy (Prov. of Udine). This German variety offers direct evidence for the existence of a split-CP in two respects: (i) adverbial clauses are introduced by an appropriate complementizer as vaspegn ‘because’ to which could be added as ‘that’ as a second complementizer; (ii) multiple complementizers are attested in embedded interrogative clauses as well. The second type of data, presented in section 3, includes constructions from Middle Bavarian, which have a special form of emphatic topicalization.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007099/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007099<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Quaderni di Lavoro ASIt</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>split-cp, multiple complementizers, emphatic topicalization, german(ic), bavarian, saurian, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>556 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007099">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007099">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
