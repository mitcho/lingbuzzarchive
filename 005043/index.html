This is a generals paper I wrote during my PhD program in linguistics at MIT. Uploaded here is the final submitted version, which has been unavailable to the public. I am sure that it contains many errors and inadequacies. The paper only discusses the main ideas for a new framework, and leaves many details to be worked out.
