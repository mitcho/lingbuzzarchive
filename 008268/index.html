They heard sequences of tones varying in duration, intensity, or both; stimuli differed in the magnitude of the acoustic differences between alternating tones and involved both short and long between tone silent intervals. While the results were not always compatible with ITL predictions and did not show strong grouping preferences, language-related differences did emerge, with Korean participants showing a preference for trochees, and Greek participants being more sensitive to duration differences than the other two groups. Significantly, grouping preferences showed substantial individual variation, evinced with both test sequences and controls (sequences of identical tones). These findings indicate that results from ITL experiments are influenced by linguistic background but are also difficult to replicate, as individual preferences and specific experimental conditions have a strong effect on how participants impose rhythm structure to sound sequences. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008268/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008268<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cambridge University Press</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>iambic-trochaic law, rhythm, grouping, individual differences, phonology, phonetics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>248 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008268">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008268">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
