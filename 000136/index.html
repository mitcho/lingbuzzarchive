between two positions is too long, that is, as an upper bound on the distance an

element may move (Standard Locality). This article explores some consequences of

asking whether the opposite effect exists also, in terms of the Anti-Locality

Hypothesis: movement must be local, but not too local. Anti-Locality is formulated

through a tripartite split of clause structure into Prolific Domains, sub-domains of the

derivation relevant for the operation Spell Out. The focus of the investigation will be

generalized successive-cyclic movement: clause-internal movement from thematic to

A- to AÂ’-positions as well as movement across clause boundaries, thereby unifying

the derivational steps involved in unrelated constructions. I argue that within a clause,

an element can only ever move to the next higher Prolific Domain (Intra-Clausal

Movement Generalization), while movement across clauses targets a position within

the next higher Prolific Domain of the same type (Inter-Clausal Movement

Generalization). These two generalizations are claimed to boil down to an interaction

between Standard and Anti-Locality considerations. Consequently, we can observe a

transparent symmetry in locality issues, which I take to be a desirable result.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000136/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000136<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Syntax 6.3 (260-312, 2003)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>anti-locality, prolific domains, copy spell out, minimalism, grammatical formatives, resumption, predication, cyclicity, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1092 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000136">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000136">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
