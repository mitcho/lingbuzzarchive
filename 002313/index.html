theory of natural language syntax called Hybrid Type-Logical
Categorial Grammar (Hybrid TLCG). Hybrid TLCG was first proposed in
Yusuke Kubota's dissertation 
(<a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002320">lingbuzz/002320</a>), and has since been
developed by the present two authors. As of writing (November 2014),
there are three journal articles (including
<a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002123">lingbuzz/002123</a>
and 
<a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002300">lingbuzz/002300</a>),  
two manuscripts under review for publication
(<a href=http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002214>lingbuzz/002214</a> 
and
<a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002150">lingbuzz/002150</a>)
and two conference papers (whose content only partially
overlaps with the five longer manuscripts) which use Hybrid TLCG as
the underlying framework for analyzing complex empirical phenomena
such as Gapping, pseudogapping, nonconstituent coordination, complex
predicates and the semantics of symmetrical predicates
("same"/"different"). See the "Preface" section of the uploaded pdf
for the relevant references, and links to each paper. <br><br>

Though we have made every effort to present our framework clearly in
each of these papers, space limitations have made it difficult to
explain all the important details in journal article and conference
paper formats. Categorial grammar, after all, involves forbidding
technical content that is not necessarily familiar to linguists, and
Hybrid TLCG in particular belongs to a tradition which takes the
logical underpinnings of the theory very seriously. <br><br>

The present document unpacks the relevant details in a (hopefully)
considerably more leisurely and accessible format than in previously
published material of ours, aiming to provide a gentle introduction to
Hybrid TLCG to syntacticians and semanticists who do not have any
background in categorial grammar. The presentation is specifically
pitched to readers who are trained in and familiar with the standard
derivational approach to syntax. <br><br>

This is the first version of the draft, and though we believe that it
is already useful for readers who have found the above articles
challenging to read, we anticipate that there are still several places
where further improvements can be made. So, comments on any aspect of
this document are earnestly solicited and would be very much
appreciated. Please send us feedback, and we'll further revise and
improve the presentation. <br><br>
