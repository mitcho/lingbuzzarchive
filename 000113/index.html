Schütze</a><br/>July 2000</center>&nbsp;<p></p>This paper examines two issues concerning the status of the form "don't" when used with 3sg subjects in child English, e.g. "It don't fit": 

1) Do children know that "don't" consists of an auxiliary plus a negative, or do they misanalyze it as pure negation? 

2) If they represent "don't" bimorphemically, what grammatical features underlie the auxiliary portion? 

Numerous accounts have proposed that "don't" is first misanalyzed as Neg, predicting that it should appear (ungrammatically) in environments where not appears; the results falsify this. If "don't" contains Aux, why does it fail to agree? Guasti and Rizzi (2001) appeal to a misset parameter involving spell-out. I demonstrate that their proposal makes incorrect empirical predictions for a subset of children, e.g. nonagreeing "do" is not found without "n't". An underspecification approach to root/optional Infinitives based in Distributed Morphology better captures these facts by treating 3sg "do" when followed by "n't" as inserted purely to support the clitic.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000113/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000113<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>The Status of Nonagreeing Don't and Theories of Root Infinitives, Language Acquisition 17, 235 — 271 (2010)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dm, acquisition, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>453 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000113">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000113">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
