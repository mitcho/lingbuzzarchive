In this paper, we investigate one kind of such constructions: distributive numerals (DistNums) in Mandarin Chinese, which are morphosyntactic constructions containing a numeral whereby the sentence as a whole receives a distributive reading, and the numeral itself is interpreted as if it is within the scope of a distributive operator (Cable 2014) Mandarin DistNums can be either adverbial or adnominal modifiers, which typically give rise to the same truth conditions. We present novel data in which the use of an adverbial or an adnominal DistNum in a sentence gives rise to different truth conditions. Rather than concluding that these two kinds of DistNums have different meanings, we argue for a unified analysis in which the contrast between them is due to a Neo-Davidsonian architecture of the clause in the spirit of Schein (1993).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004867/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004867<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of CLS55</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>distributive numerals, distributivity, event semantics, mandarin chinese, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>275 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004867">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004867">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
