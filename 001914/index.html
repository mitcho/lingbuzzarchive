systems, and linguistics has remained overwhelmingly a descriptive,
rather than a theoretical science. The idea of language universals
has thus been a matter of finding shared properties among
the highest levels in the organization of language, rather than an
attempt to understand the connections of language to other natural
systems at all levels of its organization. Language basics such as
discreteness have been treated as axiomatic or refractory. The origin
of language has been treated as an exercise in continuity, rather
than an attempt to understand the organization of language. These
trends have been driven by the personalities of Edward Sapir, Zellig
Harris and Noam Chomsky, more than by scientific considerations.
Sapir’s eagerness, Harris’s indecision, and Chomsky’s magnetism
have generated a perfect scientific storm.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001914/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001914<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cognitive Critique 7:29-48 (2013)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>algebra, chomsky, discrete, evolution, language, mind, numbers, sentence, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>393 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001914">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001914">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
