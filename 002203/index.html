First, we claim that δ(delta/discourse)-features, as well as φ(phi)-features, can be inherited from C to T (Richards 2007; Chomsky 2008), as evidenced by wh-agreement on T in Ojibwe (Algonquian). Our analysis supports Miyagawa’s (2010) hypothesis that discourse and agreement features are two sides of the same coin, which can be distributed differently cross-linguistically. Second, we propose that although φ and δ typically bundle together on a single C head, this is not the case in all languages and in fact will vary parametrically. Ojibwe clause typing is partitioned between agreement/φ features on independent order (i.e. plain matrix) C, and discourse/δ features on conjunct order (e.g. embedded) C. This parameter, that certain features may or may not bundle on C, captures a significant cluster of properties in Ojibwe: Initial Change, lack of person prefixes in the conjunct order in contrast with the independent, as well as the availability of long-distance agreement. Our proposal supports the idea that much cross-linguistic variation reduces to the distinct feature structures making up functional heads, such as v, D, and C, rather than to primitives.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002203/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002203<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Syntax</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>feature inheritance – clause typing – discourse features – wh-agreement – ojibwe – algonquian – feature bundles – long-distance agreement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002203/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2900 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002203">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002203">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
