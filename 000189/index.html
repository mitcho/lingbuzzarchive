Toivonen's book clearly outlines the major properties of

 Swedish particle-verb constructions and provides an original analysis of them based in the LFG framework. Her analysis suggests that the possibility of projection of X

P-structure is a lexical property, and that particles are words which are lexically specified as non-projecting. The specifics of her analysis lead her to conclude that

 Swedish verb-particle constructions are importantly different from English ones. In my review, I question this conclusion, suggesting that the differences between Swed

ish and English are not so deep as to suggest that a unified analysis cannot be found. I also briefly examine the notion of projection as a lexical property, and sugges

t that it might profitably be thought of in terms of the presence of functional structure dominating lexical material.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000189/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000189<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>2008 in Language 84.3:666-670</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>swedish, particle verbs, verb-particles, projection, x-bar, lfg, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>872 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000189">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000189">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
