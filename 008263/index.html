(i.e. can the noun in question be measured in terms of cardinality) and their role in the architecture of the
grammar. To accomplish this goal, the proposed research aims to develop the basis for a comprehensive
theory of individuation and number by probing the distribution of individuation and number features in the
nominal domain, as instantiated by the count-mass distinction. I argue that individuation and number are
two distinct properties both of which are part of Universal Grammar’s inventory of features and they affect
the words’ ability to occur in different morpho-syntactic environments within and across languages. Individuation
is responsible for making discrete units available, i.e. sometimes referred to as atoms, and number
is responsible for determining whether the word in question refers to the minimal units (i.e singular) or nonminimal
units (i.e. plural). In a nutshell, I make the case that what makes a noun ‘count’ is markedness for
both individuation and number, whereas countable nouns need only be marked for individuation. Variation
depends on which of the two features are available. The general picture that emerges is one where being
count entails being countable, but being mass does not entail being non-countable. I then go on to show
how the proposed theory (i) makes predictions about, and accounts for, different form-meaning mismatches;
and (ii) enables us to establish robust cross-linguistic generalizations that link syntactic structure to form and
meaning, illuminating our understanding of the interactions between the different modules of the grammar.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008263/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008263<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD Dissertation, University of Southern California</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>nominal morpho-syntax and semantics, count-mass distinction, number, measure words, numerals, english, mongolian, spanish</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>296 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008263">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008263">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
