Unlike claims that have been made about Dinka, I propose that in Mòcheno the transparency of extraction is not due to the presence of an EPP feature on the heads of vP and CP, but to the presence of a “double-V2” mechanism involving a head of the high periphery (Rizzi 1997, Benincà 2001) and a head of the vP periphery (Jayaseelan 2001, Belletti 2004) and to movement of one XP to FocusP. I show that all extractions involving a focus must proceed through both FocusPs in CP and in the vP periphery. FocusP must, therefore, be considered the edge of both phases. I also demonstrate that topics can never move through the CP or the vP edges. When they appear in CP, they are shown to be extracted as a remnant within vP, as proposed for German by Müller (2004). The analysis proposed will be shown to account for all the asymmetries observed in short and long extraction between topics and foci in Mòcheno, and, between adjuncts and arguments in Dinka.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001863/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001863<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms. University of Trento</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>mòcheno, dinka, cyclic movement, v2, transparency, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>695 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001863">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001863">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
