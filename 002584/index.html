Specifically, we argued that  (i) sign language data favor dynamic analyses over E-type analyses, and that (ii) among dynamic analyses, they favor recent approaches in which all quantifiers (rather than just indefinites) introduce discourse referents. In the present paper, we provide further data that further constraint theories of donkey anaphora.  
1.  First, we show that contrary to what is predicted by early dynamic theories, dynamic binding is not blocked by operators such as negation. Rather,  dynamic binding can ‘cross’ such operators as long as a non-emptiness of the pronoun is satisfied – which is in line with some more recent dynamic proposals.
2. Second, we suggest that in some cases involving disjunctive antecedents, ASL and LSF display a subtle pattern in which (a) null sign language pronouns behave like overt pronouns in English; (b) overt sign language pronouns are more constrained and make some readings ineffable. We explain these data by postulating that any locus which is activated by an overt index must be presupposed to denote a non-empty set of individuals.
3. Third, we suggest that pronouns can co-occur with some proper names that display a  ‘donkey’ behavior – which provides additional evidence for the claim, made in Geurts 1999, that proper names can in some cases display an anaphoric behavior.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002584/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002584<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of NELS 2009, Special Session on Pronouns</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantics, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>223 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002584">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002584">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
