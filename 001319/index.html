One piece of evidence for the cycle in Maltese occurs in perfective verbs with pronominal (object-marking) suffixes.  Here, syncope of vowels in unstressed, non-final open syllables underapplies in manner which suggests that, prior to object suffixation, there is a cycle of stress on the stem (plus the subject suffix, if any). Odden (1990, 1993) points out a paradoxical exception to this pattern: vowel-final (third weak radical) verbs with object suffixes fail to show this evidence of an inner-cycle stress. In this paper I propose an analysis of the asymmetry between C-final and V-final stems cast within Optimal Interleaving (OI: Wolf 2008), a theory of phonology-morphology interaction situated within McCarthy's (2007) OT with Candidate Chains. The analysis relies crucially on the fact that extrinsic ordering in OT-CC is enforced via pairwise ordering requirements (the PREC constraints) which are violable and potentially conflicting: normally Maltese requires that stress be assigned prior to object suffixation, but this is over-ridden with V-final stems by a requirement that stress assignment take place after (pre-suffixal) vowel lengthening. It has previously been noted (Wilson 2006; Wolf 2009, 2010) that OT-CC is able to produce such transitivity paradoxes in ordering, echoing in certain ways Anderson's (1969, 1974) theory of Local Ordering, which also treats ordering as a pairwise relation. The Maltese facts suggest that this ability is desirable in a theory of phonology-morphology ordering relations.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001319/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001319<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in volume on Harmonic Serialism and Harmonic Grammar edited by John McCarthy and Joe Pater</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>maltese, cyclicity, local ordering, stress, syncope, candidate chains, optimal interleaving, ot-cc, oi, morphology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001319/v2.pdf">v2 [October 2011]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001319/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2011]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1117 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001319">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001319">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
