Specifically we discuss a type of pronoun, termed R-pronoun in van Riemsdijk (1978)’s study of Dutch, which also exists in German (see Abels (2012) and references therein). Unlike typical nominal elements in standard German, R-pronouns precede prepositions  and can be extracted from PP. Similar facts are found in Alemannic, though with a difference: for this variety, use of an R-pronoun in PP  or extraction of it from PP  requires the appearance of another morpheme, which in isolation normally means "it", but does not have any semantic contribution in the examples we focus on.  Our goal in this paper is to argue that this redundant element can be understood as the result of  doubling, via the spellout of a trace of PP-internal movement. We also analyze a similar fact involving focus. We will show that the distribution of doubles is limited by haplology—the avoidance of sequences of adjacent identical syllables/morphemes. Additionally, we will provide an explicit account of this doubling using Distributed Morphology along with a copy theory of movement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007226/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007226<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Draft, comments welcome</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>doubling, german, alemannic, prepositions, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>481 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007226">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007226">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
