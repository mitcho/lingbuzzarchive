Oshima (2007) proposes that perceived uninterpretability in factive islands is due to the necessary infelicity of the question. The central felicity constraint under this account is an answerability condition that relates the felicity of a question to the felicity of the answers defined by the question’s semantic content. The answerability condition requires that at least one of these answers be felicitous. In contrast, without postulating felicity conditions particular to questions, Abrusán (2011, 2014) credits factive islands to contradictory presuppositions. The two analyses coincide in their effects on canonical factive island cases. This means that such cases fail to provide an argument for either analysis. For each analysis, we therefore discuss data that might provide independent evidence in its support. We find compelling independent evidence in support for Oshima’s analysis, hence for the answerability condition on questions, coming from the so-called referential islands effect (Simonenko 2015) and from a non-uniqueness condition on wh-restrictors. Independent evidence for Abrusán’s analysis is more difficult to find. In fact, the analysis is in need of elaboration to be rendered consistent with the observation that the factive island effect is not attested in assertions parallel to factive island questions. We provide such an elaboration. We then identify a test case for the contradiction analysis. While speakers are divided with regard to their intuitions about the relevant data, the judgments of some speakers support the assumptions of the contradiction analysis. Given that the sets of assumptions underlying the two analyses are compatible with each other, we conclude that both are needed in a complete account of factive islands and question triviality.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003350/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003350<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>manuscript under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>factive islands, questions, uninterpretability, triviality and grammar, felicity conditions, presuppositions, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>240 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003350">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003350">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
