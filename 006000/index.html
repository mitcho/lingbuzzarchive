Given the strong intuition that these are unbounded generative procedures, the question naturally arises whether the basic operation involved in these non-linguistic systems is the familiar linguistic operation Merge.
 
However, it is not difficult to see that the research in the massively interdisciplinary, and possibly unifying, field has been scuttled by what may be called the language bias: either the system under study reflects the basic properties of language or it is not a generative system at all.
 
I argue that the language bias has no basis even in the paradigmatic cases of arithmetic and music. This is because Merge is not specific to a domain, even if it operates in a specific lexical workspace. So, whether Merge, or its variant, is a universal generative operation is an apt research question.
 
NOTE: In the book, this discussion is preceded by (a) a long discussion of why Merge is not linguistically specific, and (b) why no notion of computation applies to desert ants and birdsongs.
