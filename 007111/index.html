This is especially difficult if we consider cross-linguistic variation that has a clear impact on word order. In this paper, I present one such formalism, dubbed Expectation-based Minimalist Grammar (e-MG), that qualifies as a
simplified version of the (Conflated) Minimalist Grammars, (C)MGs (Stabler 1997, 2011, 2013), and Phase-based Minimalist Grammars, PMGs (Chesi 2005, 2007; Stabler 2011). The crucial simplification consists of driving structure building only using lexically encoded categorial top-down expectations. The commitment on the top-down procedure (in e-MGs and PMGs, as opposed to (C)MGs, Chomsky 1995; Stabler 2011) will be crucial to capture a relevant set of empirical asymmetries in a parameterized cross-linguistic perspective which represents the least
common denominator of structure building in both Parsing and Generation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007111/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007111<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>extension of the 2021 paper on e-MGs, including parameters</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>parameters, merge, move, top-down, expectations, agreement, delayed expansion, sinking, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007111/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>550 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007111">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007111">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
