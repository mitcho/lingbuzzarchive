(2022). The DOM phenomenon consists in that some direct objects bear a special morphological mark syncretic with the mark of datives, while other objects do not receive any mark, so that their realization is syncretic with subjects. The explanation of the phenomenon that is articulated in the thesis consists in the fact that the marked objects are subject to a movement operation that leaves them out of the syntactic domain in which the Agree operation takes place. This failure in the operation that licenses arguments in the syntactic component must be repaired in the course of the derivation in the morphology, by means of an operation of insertion of dissociated morphemes. The thesis is organized in two big parts. The first is dedicated to the delimitation and description of the phenomenon in Spanish. In chapter 2, three valid empirical generalizations are presented, which have been widely recognized in the literature; while in chapter 3, four generalizations based on semantic-pragmatic properties are discussed, and it is shown that these factors are not the primary triggers of the phenomenon. Part 2 is focused on the explanation of Spanish DOM. Thus, chapter 4 presents a proposal to account for the syntax of the phenomenon studied and chapter 5 is concerned with the morphology of Spanish DOM, which includes, on the one hand, the repair process of the unvalued case feature, and a proposal to explain the double pattern of syncretism.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007379/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007379<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Universidad de Buenos Aires</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dom, spanish, feature inheritance, agree failure, dissociated morphemes, morphological case, pf repair, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>181 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007379">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007379">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
