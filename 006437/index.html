It is possible for a language to have an ergative-absolutive case alignment, but apparently nominative-accusative agreement, while nominative-accusative case with ergative-absolutive agreement is claimed to be unattested (Dixon, 1994). Proposed explanations of this universal (Bobaljik, 2008, Baker, 2008, 2015, Legate, 2008) exist and have implications for theories of case. This brief note defends the validity of the universal against
alleged counter-examples in the recent literature (Wunderlich, 2012, Deal, 2015). The most striking apparent counter-examples are from Indo-Aryan (Magier, 1983), but turn out to rest on a conflation of differential object marking and accusative case. When the two are kept distinct (as I argue they must be), the counter-examples disappear, and the apparently challenging cases are seen to be the combination of two factors that must each be admitted in their own right.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006437/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006437<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>eragtivity, case, agreement, differential object marking, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>320 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006437">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006437">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
