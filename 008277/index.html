While this argument acknowledges the important differences between LLM training and child language acquisition, its validity rests on the validity of the existence proof itself, that LLMs indeed demonstrate capacity comparable to human linguistic knowledge, the terminal state of the acquisition process. We contend that such a proof has not been delivered, in large part due to the lack of rigor in LLM evaluation and the absence of serious engagement with the empirical study of child language. When trained on child-scale input data and evaluated on widely used benchmarks, LLMs can be readily matched by simple baseline models that are demonstrably inadequate for human language. As a partial remedy, we advocate for the use of thoroughly validated datasets that more accurately reflect the scope of linguistic knowledge. On these datasets, even LLMs trained on very large amounts of data perform  in a way inconsistent with human behavior. The burden of an existence proof is considerably heavier than previously realized. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008277/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008277<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Forthcoming.
