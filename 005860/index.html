Ende, a language of southern Papua New Guinea, has one directional affix that codes path towards the deictic centre when combined with verbs of motion or transfer. When this affix is combined with other verbs, it gives rise to interpretations of an associated, secondary motion event. This type of “deictic associated motion” was first explicitly described by Belkadi (2015) in several languages of Africa. Ende’s deictic associated motion system is unlike prototypical associated motion systems, such as that in Kaytetye (Pama-Nyungan, Australia), in that Ende does not have dedicated affixes that code associated
motion. Instead, Ende’s associated motion expression relies on inference on the art of speakers and hearers to give rise to the motion readings. Accordingly, we propose the terms dedicated associated motion and inferential associated motion to distinguish these two very different associated motion systems, one of which relies on dedicated affixes or other structures, and the other, which relies on speakers’ and hearers’ inferences.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005860/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005860<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Associated Motion (Empirical Approaches to Language Typology [EALT], 64)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>associated motion, directionality, deictic associated motion, ende, papua new guinea, papuan languages, semantics, morphology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>290 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005860">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005860">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
