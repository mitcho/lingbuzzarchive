One of the most basic and uncontroversial of these principles is that Agree/Move operates according to the principle of attract closest, whereby the closest suitable goal must be the target for the relevant operation (Rizzi 1990; Chomsky 1995, 2000; Richards 1998). As first pointed out by Seiter (1980), the operation of raising in the Polynesian language Niuean (Tongic subgroup) raises suspicions as to whether this principle is truly at work in all languages. Niuean raising, despite patterning under all relevant diagnostics as A-movement, may felicitously target objects in the presence of subjects that are themselves optionally accessible to the operation. Niuean lacks any form of scrambling and is rigidly VSO, so that at first glance, that attract closest is not at work. In this paper, we argue that Niuean’s challenge to universal principles is only apparent, and that the traditional attract closest condition is indeed in force in Niuean. First, we show that the availability of object-to-subject raising reflects a wider subject/object parity whereby subjects and objects appear to be equally accessible to higher probes in general. Then, we argue that this typologically uncommon equal-accessibility follows from the convergence of several oth- erwise independently attested operations: (i) object shift of case-bearing DPs to Spec(vP); (ii) an ergative case system, with case assignment achieved wholly within vP; (iii) an EPP on T triggering V/VP fronting, not DP externalization. The result is that Niuean raising adheres to standard locality constraints as conceived by Chomsky (1995, 2000).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003262/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003262<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>unpublished</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>niuean, equidistance, object-shift, ergative, raising, locality, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003262/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2017]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1232 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003262">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003262">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
