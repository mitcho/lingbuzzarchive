In particular, ditransitive constructions have rarely been taken into account, and scenario splits have often been treated separately. Here I argue that all these patterns can be understood in terms of the usual association of role rank (highly ranked A and R, low-ranked P and T) and referential prominence (locuphoric person, animacy, specificity, etc.). At the most general level, the role-reference association universal says that deviations from usual associations of role rank and referential prominence tend to be coded by longer grammatical forms. In other words, A and R tend to be referentially prominent in language use, while P and T are less prominent, and when less usual associations need to be expressed, languages often require special coding by means of additional flags (case- markers and adpositions) or additional verb coding (e.g. inverse or passive markers). I argue that role-reference association is an instance of the even more general pattern of form-frequency correspondence, and that the coding asymmetries can all be explained by frequency-based predictability and coding efficiency.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004047/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004047<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>"Linguistics" 59(1). 123-174 (2021), DOI: 10.1515/ling-2020-0252)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>differential object marking, person case constraint, ditransitive, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004047/v3.pdf">v3 [December 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004047/v2.pdf">v2 [November 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004047/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1629 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004047">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004047">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
