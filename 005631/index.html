We show that the internal composition of ADD-FCIs, as well as their distribution, differs from that attested for other free choice paradigms discussed in the literature. Morphologically, ADD-FCIs are a more complex variant of the regular universal FCIs, by virtue of an additional morpheme. This morpheme plays an additive role when it functions as a stand-alone particle, and we propose its role is similarly additive when it functions as an infix in ADD-FCIs. Couched in an exhaustification framework, we put forward a novel compositional account that can derive the interpretation of these ADD-FCIs. Distributionally, these elements are only found in the presence of the conditional mood, as well as unconditional structures. We show how our analysis, coupled with the Viability constraint used to explain the distribution of regular FCIs, can also account for their restricted distribution. In doing so, we further show how the pattern we investigate opens new perspectives regarding the licensing of free choice items in unconditionals.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005631/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005631<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>accepted to Natural Language Semantics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>free choice, additives, disjunction, exhaustification, alternatives, mood, unconditionals, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005631/v4.pdf">v4 [May 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005631/v3.pdf">v3 [May 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005631/v2.pdf">v2 [May 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005631/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>966 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005631">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005631">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
