To account for such inferences, McCarthy (2005) proposed the Free Ride Principle (FRP), which allows the learner to extend nonidentical mappings in alternating forms to non-alternating forms. Recently, Rasin and Katzir (2016) proposed Minimum Description Length as an evaluation metric for Optimality Theory and showed how complete phonological grammars can be acquired from distributional evidence alone, including URs (that are sometimes different from their surface forms), constraint rankings, and the constraints themselves. The present work shows how Minimum Description Length supports the induction of abstract, nonidentical URs from distributional evidence alone, both in cases that have motivated the FRP and in cases that have been argued to involve nonidentical URs in the absence of supporting alternations (and are thus outside the scope of the FRP).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004121/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004121<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Proceedings of NELS 48</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>learning, phonology, underlying representations, minimum description length, sanskrit, yimas, free ride, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>143 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004121">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004121">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
