I essentially argue that object agreement markers are the spell-out on verbs of differential object markers base-generated within direct objects.The theory is developed in the Nanosyntactic framework on the basis of Hungarian data. It is then extended to lay the foundations for a nanosyntactic analysis of direct object marking cross-linguistically. 
I start with an introduction to the Nanosyntactic framework. Then, I present the phenomenon of object agreement in Hungarian, in which the definiteness of a direct object is morphologically encoded on the finite verb. I then proceed to a meticulous decomposition of Hungarian pronominal direct objects and object agreement markers. I show that the latter are the spell out of a structural layer base-generated within the former. Subsequently, I extend the analysis to Hungarian full direct object DPs. On the basis of cross-linguistic differential object marking data, I argue that the structure of definite direct objects contains (at least) one more layer than the structure of indefinite direct objects. This additional layer is usually spelled out by a preposition or a morpheme affixed on direct objects. In Hungarian, however, this layer raises to the vicinity of the verb (I argue that this movement is triggered by QR). Hence, contra traditional approaches, definiteness marking of a direct object in Hungarian does not result from a feature valuation mechanism between a verb and its direct object but from the spell-out on the verb of a differential object marker. 
Finally, I suggest to extend this analysis of direct object agreement to other languages such as Ostyak, Swahili and French.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001976/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001976<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>nanosyntax; differential object marking; object agreement; hungarian; definite conjugation, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001976/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2013]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1071 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001976">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001976">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
