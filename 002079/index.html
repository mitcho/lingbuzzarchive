One type is derived from imperfective verbs; it involves productive nominalizations with gerund semantics, and it is characterized by a prosodic pattern which is encountered elsewhere in the paradigm of the verb. The other is derived from perfective verbs; it involves idiosyncratic nominalisations, both in terms of the selection of verbs which can derive them, and in terms of the semantic interpretation, and they are characterized by a prosodic pattern that never fits any of the forms in the paradigm of the verb: high tone on the two final syllables, and penultimate stress.
We propose that the notion of paradigm should be defined as the domain of systematic productivity of a stem, under full semantic transparency. Our analysis of the facts observed is that members of the paradigm - in our case the imperfective nominalisations - are subject to Steriade's Lexical Conservatism, which presses them to use a prosodic pattern available within the paradigm. When the result of the morphological process (adding the suffix -VV.je to the stem) is a new stem with an own paradigm, the new stem is as a simplex without a tone (or stress) specification in the lexicon. While it has been shown that the post-lexical, i.e. default, prosodic pattern in S-C is that with the high tone on the initial syllable (Zec 1999, Simonović 2012), we argue that lexical items with a long penultimate syllable select for a different post-lexical default, namely the one with a rising span over the two final syllables.
We argue that this picture fits well into a more general view that the lexicon has the structure of a coconut: a soft core with productive elements deriving large paradigms connected by shared lexical prosodic shapes, a hard outer layer of extreme idiosyncratic items in respect of productivity, semantics and prosody, and a middle, semi-hardened layer of derived words exiled from the paradigms of their stems, with both semantics and prosody somewhere between the two extremes.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002079/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002079<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002079">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002079</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>lexical conservatism, serbo-croatian, paradigm membership, architecture of the lexicon, semantics-prosody interface, deverbal nominalisations, semantics, morphology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>789 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002079">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002079">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
