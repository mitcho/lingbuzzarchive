In many languages, the Q-particle is phonologically empty, and so its role in various phenomena has not yet been recognized.  Most importantly, careful study of these Q-particles reveals that the phenomenon known as pied-piping does not exist, and that all putative examples of it are actually instances of normal phrasal movement of the Q-particle.

	This thesis starts from the demonstration that wh-fronting in Tlingit (Na-Dene; Alaska, British Columbia, Yukon) does not involve a syntactic relationship between the interrogative C and the wh-word.  Rather, it involves a probe/Agree relation between C and an overt Q-particle c-commanding the wh-word.  Fronting of the wh-word in Tlingit wh-questions is a mere by-product of fronting the projection of the Q-particle.  From this core observation, a syntax and semantics for Tlingit wh-questions is developed.

	Given the strong similarity between the wh-constructions of Tlingit and those of more widely studied languages, the analysis developed for Tlingit is then applied to a range of other languages.  It is found that such a Q-based theory of wh-constructions holds a variety of analytic consequences. 

	Regarding so-called pied-piping structures, the Q-based theory provides an analysis of such structures where the very concept of pied-piping is eliminated from the theory of grammar.  Furthermore, the Q-based theory provides a semantics for wh-questions that correctly interprets pied-piping structures without recourse to any mechanisms beyond those needed for wh-questions without pied-piping.  Finally, the Q-based theory accounts for various constraints on pied-piping, and correctly predicts the scope and limits of its variation across languages.  

	Beyond its treatment of pied-piping, the Q-based theory also provides a novel syntax and semantics for multiple wh-questions, which successfully ties the presence of Superiority Effects to the absence of Intervention Effects, and which correctly predicts a previously unnoticed Intervention Effect in English.  Moreover, it provides a novel, unified account of the ill-formedness of left branch extractions, as well as of preposition stranding.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000553/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000553<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>August 2007</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>wh-fronting, wh-movement, wh-in-situ, pied-piping, question particle, intervention effect, superiority effect, left branch extraction, adposition stranding, tlingit, sinhala, japanese, german, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1615 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000553">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000553">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
