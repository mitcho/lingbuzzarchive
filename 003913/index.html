We use an empirically-grounded and integrated quantitative framework involving corpus analysis, experimental meta-analysis, and computational modeling to implement minimally distinct versions of mapping approaches that (i) are either specified a priori or develop during language acquisition, and (ii) rely on either an absolute or a relative thematic role system. Using successful verb class learning as an evaluation metric, we embed each approach within a concrete model of the acquisition process and see which learning assumptions are able to match children’s verb learning behavior at three, four, and five years old. Our current results support a trajectory where children (i) may not have prior expectations about linking patterns between ages three and five, and (ii) begin with a relative thematic system, progressing towards optionality between a relative and an absolute system. We discuss implications of our results for both theories of syntactic representation and theories of how those representations are acquired. We also discuss the broader contribution of this study as a concrete modeling framework that can be updated with new linking theories, corpora, and experimental results.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003913/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003913<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>linking problem, language acquisition, syntax, thematic roles, utah, rutah, quantitative methods, computational modeling, corpus analysis, experimental meta-analysis, argument from acquisition, argument structure</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003913/v2.pdf">v2 [November 2018]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003913/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>910 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003913">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003913">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
