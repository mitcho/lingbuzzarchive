One central debate in the linguistics literature is whether this mapping is innately specified (innate-mapping) or learned (derived-mapping) during language acquisition. We use an empirically-grounded and integrated quantitative framework involving corpus analysis, experimental meta-analysis, and computational modeling to implement minimally distinct versions of innate-mapping and derived-mapping approaches and two different types of thematic role systems (categorical vs. relative). Using successful verb class learning as an evaluation metric, we embed each approach within a concrete model of the acquisition process and see which learning assumptions are able to match children’s verb learning behavior at three, four, and five years old. Our results support a trajectory where children (i) do not have built-in expectations about linking patterns to begin with, instead developing them over time, and (ii) begin with a relative thematic system, progressing towards optionality between a relative and a categorical system. We discuss implications of our results for both theories of syntactic representation and theories of how those representations are acquired.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003913/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003913<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>linking problem, language acquisition, syntax, thematic roles, utah, rutah, quantitative methods, computational modeling, corpus analysis, experimental meta-analysis, argument from acquisition, argument structure</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>136 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003913">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003913">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
