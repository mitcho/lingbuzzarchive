One place where this analytic tension is played out is in the analysis of non-overt subjects in different contexts, i.e. in obligatorily controlled (OC) “PRO” and (little) “pro”. Although, on the surface, the two elements — both silent, pro-forms and occuring typically in subject position — have a great deal in common, we can discern both distributive and interpretive distinctions once we dig a little deeper. OC PRO yields sloppy readings under vP ellipsis, is obligatorily coreferent with a local antecedent and yields obligatory de se readings in attitude contexts. Little pro may be negatively defined with respect to each of these diagnostics. Distributionally, OC PRO seems universal and is the subject of a prototypically non-finite clause; but pro may be the subject or object of a finite clause and is famously parametrized.  It is probably safe to say that it is standard to take an Inherent approach to this distinction (e.g. Chomsky 1982, Martin 2001, Hornstein 1999, Landau 2004, 2013), with PRO treated as being essentially anaphoric and pro treated as being fundamentally pronominal. There have, however, been a number of Derived proposals (e.g. Borer 1989, Manzini 2009, Kissock 2014, Duguine 2015, Fischer 2015).

The goal of this paper is to argue for a version of the Derived view. In particular, we will empirically motivate the idea that OC PRO, NOC PRO and pro correspond to distinct interpretations of a single underspecified nominal pro-form, "UPro", that arise based on what UPro Agrees with in the course of the derivation and to language-specific rules of realization that then apply. Crucially for us, Agree is fallible in the sense of Preminger (2014), thus failure to Agree yields a substantive result, and not a crash.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002987/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002987<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the 46th Annual Meeting of the North East Linguistic Society (NELS)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pro(-drop), pro, obligatory control, non-obligatory control, finiteness, fallible agree, fallible control, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>603 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002987">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002987">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
