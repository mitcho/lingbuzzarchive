It is based mainly on the observed analogy between mathematical operations performed on algebraic objects on one side and joining of syntactic constituents to larger composite constituents on the other side. The working elements of algebraic operations (operators and operands) are mapped on syntactic constituents. The proposed approach is partly motivated by two existing (but disparate) ideas: first to treat syntax as an algebraic object and second by the attribution of different roles (asymmetry) to joined constituents. In the proposed approach both aspects are unified and coherently integrated. A graphical representation of sentence decomposition in matrix form is proposed and demonstrated as a suitable representational tool. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008442/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008442<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntactic-algebraic analogy, operator-operand relation, asymmetry of constituents, matrix representation., semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>130 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008442">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008442">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
