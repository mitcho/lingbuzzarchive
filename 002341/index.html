The main evidence in support of this analysis is that Kinande does not exhibit reconstruction effects with A'-movement, which suggests that it involves a resumptive strategy to accomplish long distance displacement. This is because, in effect, all clauses, embedded or not, act like main clauses, which results in systematic islands. As a consequence, wh-agreement in Kinande and presumably in other languages with wh-agreement, without checking for reconstruction effects, cannot be taken as evidence for feature motivated intermediate checking of links of an A’-movement chain, nor can it be taken as evidence of successive cyclic movement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002341/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002341<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In José M.
