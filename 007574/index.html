Previous analyses have sought to derive the sluice in Hindi-Urdu in the same manner as in English, i.e. through a process of wh-movement to Spec CP followed by TP elision.
The current study differs from the aforementioned and attempts to put forth a novel analysis of the phenomenon. Following prior work on the subject, the paper posits that the most convincing derivation of a sentence like (1) involves the claim the wh-movement in the otherwise wh-in-situ languages is somehow exceptional. What the study focuses on, is the nature of the kind of movement that feeds elision and the motivation for such movement. Further questions that are answered include the issue of the landing site of the remnant, and the precise location of the [E] feature.
The presence of the complementiser in embedded questions in Hindi-Urdu forms a primary argument for the claim that the position that the wh-phrase targets is lower than the complementiser which heads C, namely SpecFP, as in Hungarian (E´, Kiss 1987: 56–61; van Craenenbroeck & Lipták 2008), and Farsi (Toosarvandani, 2009). Much like in regular embedded questions ((2)), the sluicing construction in Hindi-Urdu allows the complementiser ‘ki’ to co-occur with the remnant at the clause initial position in the sluice, as can be seen from (3).

Through the interaction between the complementiser and the wh-remnant of the sluice, it is shown that the interrogative phrase undergoes focus fronting to Spec-FP (as in non-sluicing cases), followed by an elision of TP. The kind of movement posited here, is suggested to be more like scrambling than wh-movement; an observation which is also put through tests indicated in Richard (2001), in an attempt to disambiguate movement to positions lower than CP versus positions in the left periphery.
Additional evidence for Focus movement comes from the fact that Hindi-Urdu attests both WH- and non-WH sluicing, which follows directly from the claim that the [E] feature resides in the Foc0. It is shown that the strong [E] feature in the language mandates the presence of the WH-phrase to the Spec position next to it, thereby enabling the checking process, which drives the focus fronting in sluicing contexts. A direct consequence of this analysis is that it allows a finer picture of WH-fronting to unfold in the language, for both sluicing and non-sluicing contexts.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007574/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007574<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Coyote Papers, University of Arizona Linguistics Circle</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sluicing; hindi; indo-aryan; focus fronting; pseudosluicing, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>145 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007574">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007574">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
