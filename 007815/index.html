the phonological evolution of languages. However, humans are prone to errors, and cannot track thousands of parallel word derivations in
any efficient manner. We propose to instead automatically derive each lexical item in parallel, and we demonstrate forward reconstruction
as both a computational task with metrics to optimize, and as an empirical tool for inquiry. For this end we present DiaSim, a user-facing
application that simulates “cascades” of diachronic developments over a language’s lexicon and provides diagnostics for “debugging”
those cascades. We test our methodology on a Latin-to-French reflex prediction task, using a newly compiled dataset FLLex with
1368 paired Latin/French forms. We also present, FLLAPS, which maps 310 Latin reflexes through five stages until Modern French,
derived from Pope (1934)’s sound tables. Our publicly available rule cascades include the baselines BaseCLEF and BaseCLEF*,
representing the received view of Latin to French development, and DiaCLEF, build by incremental corrections to BaseCLEF aided by
DiaSim’s diagnostics. DiaCLEF vastly outperforms the baselines, improving final accuracy on FLLex from 3.2%to 84.9%, and similar
improvements across FLLAPS’ stages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007815/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007815<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of 1st Workshop on Language Technologies for Historical and Ancient Languages</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>french, latin, computerized forward reconstruction, historical phonology, diachronic phonology, romance, historical derivation, reflex prediction, computational historical linguistics, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>117 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007815">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007815">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
