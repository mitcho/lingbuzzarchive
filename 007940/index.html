This paper examines two kinds of case in the context of ATB movement: Unmarked case, and case whose assignment relies on an element external to the conjunction site (''distantly assigned case''). I show that unmarked case and distantly assigned case obey the same case-syncretism requirements as other kinds of case, which is unexpected under existing multidominance-based sharing analyses of ATB movement. I present a derivational pathway for sharing structures in which material comes to be shared upon merger of two structures containing the same syntactic element from the numeration.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007940/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007940<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of NELS 53</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>atb movement, case, unmarked case, syncretism, multidominance, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>257 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007940">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007940">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
