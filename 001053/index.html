of Negation and Interrogation by children native speakers of Qatari dialect. The two

structural areas were chosen because:

a) QUESTIONS AND NEGATIONS, AS BASIC COMPONENTS OF LANGUAGE, PROVIDE

RICH DATA FOR THE STUDY OF SYNTAX AS WELL AS OF SEMANTICS.

b) THEY HAVE BEEN MUCH STUDIED IN THE CASE OF ENGLISH AND OTHER

LANGUAGES.

c) THEY ARE ACQUIRED EARLY; ALSO THEY ARE EASY TO LEARN WITH

STRAIGHT-FORWARD PRAGMATIC AND SEMANTIC NOTIONS (KRASHEN, 1981).

d) MOST IMPORTANTLY, ASKING AND NEGATING ARE ESSENTIAL FOR

COMMUNICATION EVEN AT VERY EARLY STAGES.

The investigation is an attempt to contribute further to our understanding of First

Language Acquisition processes. The aims of the study, briefly stated, are to

determine that:

1) The development towards the target is a creative system of increasing

complexity

2) The linguistic behaviours of the acquirers are systematic and

rule-governed.

3) The developmental sequences can be identified for each of the syntactic

areas studied<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001053/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001053<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences.
