Similarly,topic drop is solely responsible for the missing object in Hebrew structures which have been argued to involve VP-ellipsis or a moved null operator. We outline the properties of topic drop and show that these same properties pertain in the constructions in question. We argue against movement analyses of both constructions and propose that missing objects are to be analyzed as unvalued feature bundles that receive an interpretation from an available topic in the discourse. From the fact that topic drop is constrained differently in the two languages we discuss, as well as in other languages that have been studied, we conclude that topic drop is a PF-interface phenomenon.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001507/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001507<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Lingua 136, 145–169, 2013</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>topic drop, vp ellipsis, parasitic gaps, russian, hebrew, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2185 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001507">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001507">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
