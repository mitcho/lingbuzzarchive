In this study we will use the data patterns gained from our, anomic, aphasic patient, RC, to demonstrate the correctness of certain phonological hypotheses about the representation and processing of transparent compounds  compared to simplex long words of equal length and syllabic complexity. Specifically we will demonstrate that RCs production of errors and lack thereof is consistent with an analysis based on the principle of phonological licensing. These conclusions, furthermore, will bind the theory of representations of compounds with their distinct licensing characteristics to a general theory of non-typologically informed markedness; a view of markedness which is based on cognitively sourced behaviour and noticed early by Jakobson (1941) . We will conclude our thesis with a novel procedural account of the mapping between phonology and the phonological short term memory buffer (pSTM). We will base this on the observations that the patients production of two-syllable words (2ó-ù) are near perfect, indicating a largely intact phonological module; and that the immunity of compounds of equal length and complexity to long- words, indicates that a simple pSTM limited capacity account would also not be sufficient. Together, these observations, we will argue, demonstrate that neither a phonological deficit nor a simple pSTM deficit can completely account for the data; therefore we turn to a procedural account in the discussion of our results where the compounds special representation interacts with our proposed phonology-pSTM mapping. The specifics of this mapping will link the phonological environment of RCs errors: contiguous consonants and long vowels and initial unstressed syllables, with the compounds special representation. The link, we will claim, comes from phonological licensing, specifically: a-licensing (Harris 1997). Our proposal, quickly stated, is that phonology is an exercise in licensing (cf. Calabrese 2005 ) and that once licensed phonological objects are mapped to the pSTM buffer to await articulation. We follow (Kaye et al. 1990) in stating that licensing is a phonological operation carried out by the domain-head, the primary stressed nucleus, therefore, in difference to a long word, a compound underlyingly contains two such domain heads (Kaye 1995), we argue, therefore, that compounds are processed in parallel, from each domain-head, which makes compounds doubly efficient in phonology to pSTM mapping compared to a long word of equivalent length and complexity. This novel processing model, sensitive to phonological licensing considerations, could only be positively revealed by a patient with a highly specific pSTM deficit and so it is with evidence from aphasia that we support our phonological hypothecations. 



Part one has many roles. Primarily it will be focussed on providing a literature review for the matters the thesis deals with, the section on pSTM and compounds for instance. Part one however also serves to justifying the phonological tack we adopt in this paper and serve as an explanation for why certain disparate phonological approaches were not offered in our discussion in part three as competing models. Also, part one is used for setting up a justified mental architecture for the processing of lexical items, from the lexicon to phonology to the pSTM and extensively arguing for the independence and mode of functioning of each, contrasting alternate theories and situating the thesis in phonological perspective; specifically, this is used in combination to preliminary studies run by Michele Miozzos Sound to Sense laboratory to make a precision diagnosis as to the depth and type of the patients deficit. 



Part two, will begin with exploring what RCs preliminary results indicate and what these might mean for phonology. We then describe an experiment, mostly assembled by the author and incorporate these findings to the preliminary studies made available to the author by Dr Miozzo and present the results. 



Part three, attempts to construct an inference to the best explanation hypothesis based on the results collected in part two and link the phonological environments which are prone to error with the special representation of compounds (as argued for in part one) in line with Harris (1997) view of a-licensing, specifically, in differentiation of long words. We also, (based on our discussion in part one) construct a novel procedural account for the mapping of phonology to pSTM and show how it can explain the error data in long words, crucially the fragments, and the immunity of compounds and short words.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000683/current.file">file</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000683<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>MPhil Thesis, currently unpublished</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonology, phonological theory, aphasia, compounds, internal representations, phonological short term memory, government phonology, optimality theory, realistic phonology, domains, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000683/v1.doc">v1 [June 2008]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2061 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000683">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000683">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
