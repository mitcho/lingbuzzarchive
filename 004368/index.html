The analysis to be proposed not only captures the relevant data of NGC discussed in the literature (both D-licensing and C-licensing and those problematic for both of them) but explains why the judgements of NGC examples are divergent among speakers (Ogawa et al. 2018). The central claim is that the genitive subject results from two mechanisms: one is nominative in disguise in the context of clausal nominalization, which descends from Classical Japanese and is now getting closer to extinction, and the other is Spell-Out by D. These two modes of case assignment are morphological processes, but syntax also plays an important role as the tradition of Case-features does, since argument DPs are in need of the valuation of their T-features, which then explains various impossible cases of NGC such as the no-da construction and Miyagawaâ€™s (2012) dependent tense. Also, this paper is a serious attempt to study NGC in terms of the case assignment as a post-syntactic operation (Bobaljik 2008, Marantz 1992, McFadden 2004, Levin 2017, i.a.). Insofar as the proposed mechanism of NGC is on the right track, it will contribute to such a perspective toward the case theory.
