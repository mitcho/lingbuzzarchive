While initial accounts modified the interpretive procedure to account for them (Chierchia 2004), the dominant view is now that local implicatures are computed by an invisible but syntactically real version of only, the exhaustivity operator Exh (Chierchia, Fox, and Spector 2012). We argue that all current accounts (including the operator-based view) are faced with a challenge because some expressions display a Janus-faced behavior: they simultaneously seem to include and to exclude Exh. Take the discourse 'Syldavia will invade Spain or Portugal. But Biden doubts it.' The first sentence is naturally understood to mean that Syldavia will invade Spain or Portugal but not both, but the second sentence means that Biden doubts that Syldavia will invade Spain or Portugal (or both). We uncover several types of Janus sentences of this sort using anaphora and (in an appendix) using ellipsis and embedding under unlike. Janus sentences are found with unaccented scalar terms, but usually not with controls involving overt only or accented scalar terms. Without solving the puzzle, we discuss one broad solution strategy, which consists in complicating the semantics of the exhaustivity operator so that it can always be present, but with semantic effects that are systematically trivialized in some environments.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007661/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007661<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>implicatures, ellipsis, exhaustivity, pronouns, pragmatics, covert operators, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>383 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007661">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007661">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
