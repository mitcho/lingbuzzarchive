How do iconicity and the grammar interact? The simplest possible answer is that they interact very little: both communicate meanings, but these meanings are combined intersectively at the level of discourse, like distinct propositions. I will argue that this simple hypothesis is incorrect: at least some iconic meanings are not combined via intersection, and iconic meaning must in general be integrated throughout grammatical composition. I will argue that an illuminating way to think about iconicity is in terms of semantic scope: like logical operators, iconic meanings can take scope at different levels in a logical form. Depending on where the iconic meaning takes scope, it may have different effects on the overall meaning of a sentence, sometimes seeming to disappear completely. I motivate this perspective with data from two different domains: first, iconic modifications of verbs, including pluractional verbs; second, the use of loci to organize discourse referents.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007748/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007748<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sign language, iconicity, scope, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>203 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007748">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007748">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
