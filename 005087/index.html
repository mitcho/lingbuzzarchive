is it possible that language, mathematics, and biology are all built on the same design? this report continues from two previous in lingbuzz, ‘the grid of language’ (mar 2010) and ‘the amazing rule of four’ (feb 2016). latecomers and strangers to the tagalog grid should visit the latter at least to gain best from this present work. i take it up from these conclusions there: the quadrisections, we see, are telling our mental world apart; the grid is like a coordinate system for our organism’s information sources; and the foursome of our {senses, memory, mind, brain}, what i call qθ (q-zero), obviously signifies the four communicating internal circuitries of an organism that are responsible for its continued survival. and should one wonder what kind of actions each contributes to our language making, it is precisely what the tagalog grid is spelling out for us, affix set by affix set, quadrisection by quadrisection. what senses are at work? what memories are required? what actions are available? what conclusions are desirable? it  is in this light i revisit the um grids of the volitional UM and non-volitional UM affix sets in ‘amazing’, to possibly perfect them according to the lines suggested by the surfaced rule of qθ and to see what other eurekas might be in store in that direction. the results are frankly astonishing.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005087/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005087<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>philippines</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>cognitive semantics, tagalog grammar, lexicography, translation, natural language processing, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, philosophy of language, neurolinguistics, biolinguistics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005087/v2.pdf">v2 [March 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005087/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>454 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005087">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005087">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
