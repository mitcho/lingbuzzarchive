The secondary reason for conducting this study was to know about the departmental support to English
teachers. The researcher has chosen a mix-method to explore the factors causing problems and
departmental support to English teachers. By keeping this desire in view, English teachers of secondary
level try to give their best to the students but unfortunately due to some basic factors they face many
problems in teaching the learners effectively. Most of the secondary level English language learners
even do not know the ABC of English. There is no focus on students’ language learning by their
parents. The study results have been presented in the form of a table and interpretation of the semistructured interviews. SPSS software is used to investigate the thematic analysis. Thematic analysis is
described in the form of frequency, mean and standard deviation. The results show that there should
be enough exposure to the language to learn English at the secondary level. Most of the students cannot
study English at the Secondary level, but unfortunately, there is no system to stop and focus on making
their base.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007456/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007456<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Turkish Online Journal of Qualitative Inquiry (TOJQI)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>challenges, teaching, language, departmental, support, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>267 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007456">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007456">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
