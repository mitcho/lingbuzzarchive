Elliott</a><br/>September 2020</center>&nbsp;<p></p>In "Truthmaker Semantics for Natural Language", Moltmann (2020) develops a unified account of a variety of phenomena of interest to both philosophers of language and linguistic semanticists, such as attitude reports, modals, and intensional transitive verbs, in terms of object-based truthmaker semantics - a version of Fine's (2017a, 2017b, 2017c) truthmaker semantics, which expands the purview of verification/falsification from sentences to attitudinal and modal objects. As such, Moltmann's account requires a significant enrichment of the fairly austere ontology standardly assumed by semanticists, but arguably delivers concomitant conceptual and empirical gains. From a linguistic perspective, there are many reasons to find the notion of content delivered by truthmaker semantics attractive. For example, it provides a natural notion partial content which tracks speaker intuitions, as discussed extensively by Yablo (2014), and touched upon by Moltmann. Here, I'll take it as a given that an account of, e.g., attitude reports using the apparatus of truthmaker semantics is a worthwhile enterprise. The primary focus here will be on the precise semantics that Moltmann suggests for that-clauses. I'll argue that a semantics in terms of partial content fails to account for a range of facts concerning attitude reports, as well as clausal modifiers of content nouns. Rather, i'll suggest that a semantics for that-clauses based on equality of content is preferable.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005440/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005440<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Unpublished draft</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>truthmaker semantics, clausal embedding, content, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005440/v2.pdf">v2 [September 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005440/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>962 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005440">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005440">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
