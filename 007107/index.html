Auxiliary selection, which is the alternation between the perfect auxiliaries BE and HAVE, exhibits impressive variation among closely related varieties, although limited to two main types: it is either argument-structure-based (as in Italian), or subject-driven (as in many Southern Italian dialects). Crucially, in both systems the choice of the perfect auxiliary is sensitive to the features of the arguments (as visible in Italian reflexive and impersonal clauses). Hence, I argue that auxiliary selection is always the result of Agree for the person feature. 

Argument-structure-driven auxiliary selection is a challenging phenomenon because it seems to violate minimality: the relevant features are those of the lower arguments. I solve this locality problem with the principle "Nested Agree": if the features on a head are ordered, the domain of each operation is reduced by the application of the previous operation triggered by the same head. As a consequence, the dependency between two heads created by a feature is exploited by other features located on those heads.

I also extend this analysis to restructuring, showing that these configurations can be accounted for with the same tools as for root clauses. I argue that true optionality in auxiliary selection does not exist, but rather the optionality with respect to different complement sizes determine different search domains for Agree. Moreover, I also provide an analysis of past participle agreement as a morphological reflex of A-movement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007107/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007107<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD thesis, Universität Leipzig</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>auxiliary selection, agree, minimality, italo-romance, participle agreement, restructuring, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>286 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007107">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007107">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
