Much recent effort has gone into narrowing the class of allowable structures and a lot has been learned. This paper proposes that operations are linearly ordered on an essentially constituent by constituent basis. A universal constraint on the ordering of operations in language is proposed whose function is to fix the order in which operations apply. This constraint is deployed using a generalized prohibition against improper movement. The proposal captures some but not all effects of what has traditionally been called the freezing principle. It is argued that empirically exactly the right cut is made. It is further argued that the proposal rules out an entire class of remnant movement derivations, including the analysis of cross-serial dependencies in Nilsen (2003) and the analysis of order-preservation in Koopmand and Szabolcsi (2000).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000353/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000353<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000353">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000353</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Linguistic Variation Yearbook vol. 7</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>remnant movement, cross serial dependency, improper movement, linear correspondence axiom, lca, linear order, cycle, freezing principle, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000353/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2006]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1214 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000353">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000353">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
