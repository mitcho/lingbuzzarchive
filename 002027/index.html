constructions (TCs) and gapped degree phrases (GDPs). Specifically, this paper claims
that both constructions contain an “improper movement” chain, where an A-bar movement
step is followed by an A movement step. An A-bar movement step for TCs and GDPs has
been proposed in the literature since Chomsky (1977). I show that recent tests for
an A movement step in TCs (Hartman 2009, 2012) also suggest the presence of an
A movement step in GDPs, based on the ability of oblique arguments to function as
“defective intervenors” to gapped-degree movement. However, GDPs and TCs are not
identical: GDPs assign an extra theta-role, and allow subject gaps (which TCs do not). To
account for this, I propose (following Chomsky 1977, and more recently Nissenbaum
& Schwarz 2011) that GDPs are null operator structures, where the null operator
itself undergoes “tough” (e.g., improper) movement within the degree phrase. An
independently motivated anti-locality constraint (Erlewine 2013) explains the subject
gap asymmetry between TCs and GDPs. Thus GDPs can be understood as containing
a tough-movement “core” inside their DegP. The presence of this movement “core” and
the larger structure of the GDP are enough to explain relationship between the two
constructions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002027/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002027<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>MIT (Manuscript, comments welcome)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>tough movement, anti-locality, gapped degree phrases, improper movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002027/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>820 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002027">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002027">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
