(answering) the phone, and (going to) the hospital. They are called weak definites
because, in contrast to regular definite phrases, they can occur in contexts where 
more than one individual satisfies their descriptive content. In addition, weak 
definites exhibit a number of other peculiar properties. The main contribution 
of this dissertation is a compositional analysis of the meaning of weak definites, 
which is based on the intuition that these phrases refer to kinds of individuals. 
The analysis accounts for the special behavior of these phrases plus it makes 
a number of theoretical and empirical predictions, which this dissertation also 
aims to corroborate.
 This work constitutes a relevant contribution to the literature on definite phrases 
and weak referentiality. It should also be of interest to any linguist, language 
philosopher and psycholinguist studying the interpretation of various noun 
phrases, genericity, adjectives, meaning enrichment, and the lexical meaning 
of nouns.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002257/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002257<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Landelijke Onderzoekschool Taalkunde Dissertation Series</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>weak definites, definite generics, reference to kinds, definite nps, bare singulars, meaning enrichment, genericity, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1735 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002257">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002257">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
