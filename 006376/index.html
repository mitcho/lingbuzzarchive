This biased approach has directed the search for the language faculty in a wrong direction, confusing products of evolution with the fruits of advanced civilization. In an effort to minimize this bias I argue that the linguistic output of the average hunter-gatherer is the most relevant source for understanding  the Language faculty and sheds light on its evolution. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006376/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006376<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language faculty, writing, linguistic theory, language evolution, language evolution, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>241 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006376">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006376">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
