Payne and McVay (1971, henceforth P&M) use this to posit a syntactic object smaller than the entire song but larger than its atomic sound units, called a phrase. P&M implicitly establish repeatability as a diagnostic of phrasehood: phrases are delineable from surrounding material because units internal to a phrase repeat to the exclusion of other units: if a song consists of two adjacent phrases [AB][CD], the sequences ABAB and CDCD will be attested, and crucially, BCBC will never be attested, since B and C do not form a phrase. This constituency test parallels those used in linguistic syntax, like co-ordination and pro-form replacement, and gives a means of falsifying posited constituents and proposing new ones. I extend this reasoning to phrase-internal structure in one humpback song type, and show that nested repetition phenomena in certain phrases cannot be explained without multiply-embedded, binary-branching hierarchical structures, with a depth of three phrasal layers in at least one case. I show that context-free grammars (CFGs), and not regular grammars, are able to generate the observed patterns without also overgenerating. I propose that humpbacks are the only known nonhuman species demonstrably capable of processing hierarchical structure at this depth. I explore what evolutionary insights might be provided by the existence of syntax in a potentially asemantic cognitive system like humpback song, particularly in light of proposals like Katz & Pesetsky (2009) that language and music might share a common mental syntax.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004767/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004767<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cambridge</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>animal communication, humpback whale, context-free grammar, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>77 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004767">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004767">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
