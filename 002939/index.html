213 order. In this context it is remarkable that Swiss German features a verb
cluster-like construction with an unmarked 213 order. I will argue that this
construction indeed represents a proper verb cluster and not an instance of
the 3rd Construction, which also allows for the 213 order. Based on new di-
agnostics, viz. displaced zu and relative clause extraposition, I will show that
verb clusters/Verb Projection Raising diﬀer from the 3rd Construction with
respect to a fundamental structural relation: while the lexical VP is a struc-
tural complement in the former, it is in a non-complementation relation in the
latter. Applying the diagnostics to the Swiss German 213 construction delivers
a clear result: the construction has the hallmarks of complementation and thus
represents a genuine verb cluster. I conclude from this that theories of verb
clusters must be more powerful than previously claimed in that they must be
able to generate all six logically possible orders, including the 213 order.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002939/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002939<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002939">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002939</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms. University of Leipzig</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>verb clusters, verb projection raising, 3rd construction, west-germanic, swiss german, displaced zu, adjunction, extraposition, post-syntactic morphology, local dislocation, variation, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002939/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>163 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002939">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002939">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
