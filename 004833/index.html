This dissertation develops a unified syntactic analysis of agreement, based on a formalization of minimal search. Such an analysis accounts for a variety of agreement patterns observed in various languages, including negative concord in Czech, inflection doubling in Norwegian, Frisian and Swedish, multiple agree in Japanese, cyclic agree in Georgian and Hindi Urdu, and subject-complementizer agreement in Lubukusu. The minimal search-based analysis is also extended to reflexive binding. The minimal search-based analysis of subject-verb agreement and reflexive binding captures the syntactic similarity between these two constructions. 

This dissertation then argues that subject-verb agreement and reflexive binding have an important representational difference: the phi-features involved in subject-verb agreement and reflexive binding are essentially different in their semantic content. The phi-features on bound reflexives (and bound variables generally) have semantic content and are semantically interpretable, whereas those on agreeing verbs/T heads are not semantically interpretable. 

The syntactic and semantic analyses of agreement and reflexive binding have crucial consequences for the sentence processing study of subject-verb agreement and reflexive binding. This dissertation proposes that in cue-based retrieval, mismatches of semantically interpretable retrieval cues (in reflexive binding) are less tolerable to the parser than mismatches of phonological cues (in subject-verb agreement). Experimental results are provided to evaluate this Asymmetry of Interpretability Hypothesis. The results reveal that the (un)acceptability of a target sentence by an experimental participant influences the occurrence of illusions of grammaticality/facilitatory effects for that participant: facilitatory effects do not occur for grammatical or acceptable sentences. The results also indicate that there are significant contributing factors to the emergence of illusions of grammaticality/facilitatory effects, involving relative differences between the target and distractor with respect to frequency, phonological length, orthographic length, phonological neighborhood density, and orthographic neighborhood density. These results suggest that the distractors are not completely ignored in the retrieval of the relevant target in subject-agreement and reflexive binding.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004833/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004833<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Michigan</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>subject-verb agreement, reflexive binding, illusions of grammaticality, cue-based retrieval, minimal search, phi-features, sentence processing, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>458 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004833">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004833">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
