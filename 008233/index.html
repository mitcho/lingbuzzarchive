Analysis of a heterogeneous set of first-hand data from Reunion Creole reveals that at least two distinct LHR structures exist for the same surface form, one likely deriving from the other. I argue that a third structure, which is a true free relative clause and not a light-headed one, may be developing from two light headed ones, meaning that demonstratives are a source for free relative pronouns in this language. The article contributes, on the one hand, to our knowledge and understanding of an underrepresented language, and on the other hand, to our understanding of the typology of headless relative clauses. In examining the distinction between light-headed and free relatives in Reunion Creole, the article sheds light on a pathway of grammaticalisation, from light headed relative to free relative, that has to date received little attention.
