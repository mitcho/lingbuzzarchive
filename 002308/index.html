The first concerns the syntax and semantics of wh-fronting constructions in Cantonese. These constructions have counterparts in Mandarin whose status is a point of contention. Specifically, wh-fronting constructions in Mandarin have been analyzed as a type of Topic structure or Focus construction. One goal, then, is to provide additional support for the Focus approach by showing that wh-fronting constructions in Cantonese are best analyzed as a type of Identificational Focus (IdentF) construction and to argue against treating them as a type of Topic structure. Once the syntax and semantics of Cantonese wh-fronting constructions are clarified, questions arise concerning the inventory of Topics and Foci and their hierarchical order relative to IdentF in the left periphery of Cantonese. The second, theoretical goal of this chapter is to explore the fine structure of the left periphery in Cantonese and its implications for two prominent lines of research on the distribution of Topics and Foci. The findings lend empirical support to Benincà and Poletto’s (2004) proposal that Topic and Focus are fields, contra Rizzi’s (1997, 2004) proposal that Topic should be regarded as a set of recursive projections that occurs above and below a single Focus projection. The investigation further reveals that the inventory of Topics and Foci available in individual languages and their hierarchical order are the result of the interplay between language-specific and universal principles.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002308/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002308<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002308">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002308</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in The Cartography of Chinese Syntax: The Cartography of Syntactic Structures (Oxford Studies in Comparative Syntax), Volume 11, ed.
