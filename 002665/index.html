preverbal ge- in Old English and its disappearance in the course of Middle English. This prefix is reminiscent of its cognates in Modern German and Dutch 
in its distribution, but even a cursory examination of the details reveals it to be quite distinct, as we will see. The proper characterization of that distribution, and of its diachronic development, has proven to be extremely difficult. I have thus carried out a large-scale corpus study using the York-Toronto-Helsinki parsed corpus of Old English prose and the Penn-Helsinki parsed corpus of Middle English, 2nd ed. This paper will report the results of the first phase of the project, involving patterns in the data that could be identified primarily on the basis of automatic searches in the corpora. These patterns serve as the empirical basis for an improved description of the facts, and ultimately for a more precise theoretical hypothesis about the nature
of ge- than any found in previous work. I will propose specifically that ge- in OE was the default realization of a res(ultative) head in the sense of Ramchand (2008).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002665/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002665<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002665">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002665</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>ZASPiL 58 – August 2015 "Byproducts and side effects", André Meinunger (Ed.)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>aspect, resultativity, perfect, old english, middle english, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1320 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002665">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002665">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
