Verbal morphology in Indo-Aryan languages reveals a split ergative pattern along the lines of tense/aspect. A verb in the perfective aspect marks its arguments according to an ergative pattern and agrees with the argument marked for absolutive case, whilst the imperfective triggers accusative marking and agreement of the verb with the argument marked for nominative case.  Established literature on this matter states that only one possible form of case and agreement mismatch exists, namely, nominative-accusative agreement with an ergative case system; it has been argued that the opposite pattern is not possible (Anderson 1977, 1985; Moravcsik 1978; Wierzbicka 1981). I will argue that the latter pattern of ergative agreement with an accusative case system does in fact exist and is evident in Kutchi.  



In section 2, I outline the aspectual properties of Kutchi and argue that in imperfective structures the agreement pattern is nominative-accusative where subject agreement on the verb occurs in both intransitive and transitive readings.  In perfective structures, the agreement pattern appears to be ergative-absolutive.  Subject agreement is present in intransitive constructions, whereas object agreement occurs in transitive constructions.  Furthermore, I will illustrate that the case system for Kutchi is nominative-accusative both in the perfective and in the imperfective.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000242/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000242<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University College London Ms</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ergativity, case, agreement, aspect., syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>770 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000242">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000242">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
