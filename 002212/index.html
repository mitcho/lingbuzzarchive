Chapter 2 presents  two sub-theories that jointly constitute the bulk of the proposal: the first  specifies a morpho-semantics for nouns and inflectional features. In a sentence, it says that lexical count nouns denote predicates of kinds, and that the composition of inflectional features  with a noun converts the noun's kind-based meaning into a predicate of individuals, the extension of which reflects whether that noun is singular or plural, masculine or feminine, etc. The second sub-theory specifies the syntactic structure of nominal modification. Non-appositive modifiers are integrated into nominals either via adjunction to the nominal head prior to the introduction of inflectional features (head-adjunction); or via adjunction to the inflected noun, whose denotation has already been converted into a predicate of individuals (phrasal adjunction). Directionality parameters are proposed for each kind of adjunction: in English, head-adjunction is to the left only, while phrasal adjunction is bi-directional; in Italian head-adjunction is bi-directional  while phrasal adjunction is to the right only. As with all parametric theories, typological predictions can be extracted from the analysis.

The theory of Chapter 2 is applied to a selection of modification-related phenomena in the remainder of the dissertation, focusing on "Bolinger contrasts" and the approach to modification in DP that they have inspired.  This approach, "the two-domains theory," provides indispensable basic insights, but I argue is in need of more concrete and well-motivated semantic foundations. Through detailed investigation of the restrictive/non-restrictive opposition in nominal modifiers (Chapter 3), the direct/implicit relative opposition in certain modal attributive adjectives (Chapter 4), and a selection of additional modification-related puzzles (Chapter 5), I aim to establish the theory in Chapter 2 as a concrete, principled, and cross-linguistically adaptable framework for analysis of the lexical- and morpho-semantics of nouns, and of noun phrase-internal composition. By accounting for the distribution of (some) Bolinger contrasts with a more conservative set of assumptions, specific grammatical enrichments and silent elements postulated by two-domains theories are rendered largely unnecessary. While data from English are examined most thoroughly throughout, the general architecture of the theory I propose can be instantiated to yield a theory of modification for any language. In Chapters 3 and 5, discourse coherence relations are argued to play an essential role in certain quasi-grammatical phenomena related to modification, suggesting that the study of modification requires attention to discourse-level pragmatic processes.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002212/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002212<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002212">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002212</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>NYU dissertation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>modification, adjective semantics, non-restrictive adjectives, bolinger contrasts, syntax-semantics interface, discourse coherence, dp syntax, noun semantics, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2549 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002212">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002212">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
