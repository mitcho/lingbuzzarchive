The openness parameter is used in the current IPA system, in which vowels are classified into four categories: “close” vs. “close-mid” vs. “open-mid” vs. “open”. In order to quantitatively examine this concept of openness in detail, the current paper presents an articulatory study using EMA (ElectroMagnetic Articulograph) with Japanese as the target language. The main aim of this experiment is to provide exact measures of the amount of jaw opening of the five vowels in Japanese, and to investigate how the results would bear on the abstract concept of vowel openness. Our results show that while the traditional labeling of openness is more or less correct, we also observe that between the vowels of the same openness, front vowels are more open than back vowels (e.g. [e] is more open than [o]). Our results thus provide some information that goes beyond what the current IPA description of Japanese offers (Okada, 1999). We also examine the acoustic correlates of vowel openness, and compare them to jaw opening patterns. The result shows that, unsurprisingly, F1 is the most reliable correlate of vowel openness, but that other secondary cues, such as duration, F0, and intensity, are not very reliable, at least when measured in our task format.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002759/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002759<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonetics, vowels, jaw, ema, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>510 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002759">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002759">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
