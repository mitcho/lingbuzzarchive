If a language allows V- and VP-fronting, the gap-avoidance strategy is usually the same for both (as in Hebrew, Polish, German, Dutch, etc). The thesis presents new data from Asante Twi (Kwa, Niger-Congo) and Limbum (Grassfields Bantu) in which a verb copy appears in V-fronting but a dummy verb is inserted in VP-fronting. In a sample of 47 languages, the reverse pattern is not attested which is interpreted as a systematic typological gap. Another typological gap is shown to exist for languages that allow either V-fronting or VP-fronting but not both. The former always exhibit verb copying while the latter exclusively show dummy verb insertion. The thesis proposes a derivational analysis of this distribution that is framed in the Copy Theory of Movement. It is based on the idea that there is a language-specific order of application between copy deletion and head movement (which is assumed to be a PF operation) in the post-syntax which interacts with the type of syntactic movement in verbal fronting. Depending on the order and the type of movement there is either a bleeding or a counter-bleeding relation between copy deletion and head movement giving rise to dummy verb insertion and verb copying respectively.
