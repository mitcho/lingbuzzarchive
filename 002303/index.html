One possibility is that verbal affixes are instances of agreement, a relationship (AGREE) between a functional head (probe) and a DP argument (goal) resulting in the functional head displaying the φ-features of the goal (Chomsky, 2000). Another possibility is that verbal affixes are clitics, a D-like pronoun which is a copy of the φ-features of a DP argument and attaches to a functional projection (Preminger, 2009). In this paper I show that Mi'gmaq has both agreement affixes (theme signs and inner suffixes) and clitics (outer suffixes). The presence of multiple agreement affixes is important as it supports the presence of φ-feature agreement in the thematic domain (Oxford, 2013), as opposed to agreement being solely limited to the inflectional domain (Woolford, 2010; Nevins, 2011). I conclude that theme signs and inner suffixes are instances of φ agreement on Voice and T, respectively. However, these cannot simply be classified as object and subject agreement, as multiple arguments can, and often must, be probed in order to account for the conditioning of agreement affixes. I find evidence to support two different notions of multiple argument probing, Cyclic Agree (Béjar and Rezac, 2009) and Multiple Agree (Nevins, 2011), which are not mutually exclusive, but represent the specific nature of AGREE on Voice and T, respectively.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002303/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002303<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>(to appear) Papers of the Algonquian Conference 45</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agreement, morphosyntax, clitics, algonquian, mi'gmaq, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>599 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002303">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002303">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
