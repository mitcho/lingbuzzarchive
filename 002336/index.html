In my paper I focus on pseudocoordination with gå ‘walk, go’ as Verb 1, in particular cases where this has been claimed to give rise to a “surprise effect” (Wiklund 2005, 2008). I set out from the assumption that Verb 1 in pseudocoordination is a light verb, which, following Butt (2003, 2010), is assumed to be a special use of the corresponding main verb. I distinguish three different meaning variants of the main verb gå ‘walk, go’, and connect each of these to a particular type of pseudocoordination with gå as Verb 1. The “surprise effect” is associated with one of these, gåHAPPEN. The main verb gåHAPPEN assigns three theta-roles, one of them to quasi-argumental det, as in Det gick honom illa (it.N went him bad) ‘Things went bad for him’. As a light verb, gåHAPPEN can assign only two theta-roles; hence one argument, the EXPERIENCER, is “left over”, This situation triggers subjectification, meaning that the role is assigned to one of the speech participants, usually to the LOGOPHORIC AGENT (the speaker). The “surprise effect” is a pragmatic interpretation of this pattern of theta-role assignment, in a context where the subject is +HUMAN, hence exerting CONTROL.

As for the alleged conjunction och, pronounced [ɔ], I argue that it is a version of the infinitival marker att, which is also pronounced [ɔ]. The crucial difference is that it lacks tense.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002336/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002336<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>http://projekt.ht.lu.se/uploads/media/WPSS_93.pdf</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pseudocoordination, surprise effect, quasi-argument, subjectification, logophoric agent, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1974 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002336">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002336">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
