In Eastern Norwegian (EastN), all verbs have to follow all adverbs in non-V2 contexts. In Tromsø Northern Norwegian (TrNN) main verbs and non-finite auxiliaries have to follow all adverbs, but finite auxiliaries may precede adverbs they take scope over. In Regional Northern Norwegian (ReNN) all finite verbs (main/auxiliary) may precede all adverbs, and non-finite auxiliaries may precede adverbs they take scope over. These data are accounted for within a remnant movement approach. The variation between the three dialects is argued to follow from differences in how selectional features on auxiliaries and T are checked. It is suggested that auxiliaries are associated with a pair of functional projections (so-called lifters): a VP lifter below and an AdvP lifter above. An auxiliary with these lifters sinks below adverbs it takes scope over. Overt feature checking (through adjacency) occurs when the lifters are present; covert feature checking occurs when the lifters are absent. In EastN, overt feature checking, and the lifters, is obligatory for all auxiliaries; in TrNN this is obligatory for non-finite auxiliaries but optional for finite auxiliaries; in ReNN this is optional for all auxiliaries.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000422/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000422<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000422">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000422</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Nordlyd 34: Scandinavian Dialect Syntax</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>adverbs, embedded non-v2 clauses, feature checking, northern norwegian, norwegian dialects, remnant movement, verb movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>137 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000422">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000422">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
