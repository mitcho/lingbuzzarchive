It has been argued that for instances of acceptable preposition omission found in non-preposition-stranding languages, such as Spanish and Polish, underlying clefts with preposition stranding may provide an alternative derivational source (Vicente 2008, Szczegielniak 2008, Rodrigues et al. 2009). I show that such clefts are not available in Polish, and that, even if they were, they would still fail to account for the full range of contexts in which preposition omission is fine under sluicing. 

I report the results of two controlled acceptability studies exploring the relationship between clefts and prepositionless sluiced phrases. In the first study, judgments for clefts with preposition stranding are significantly degraded with respect to those for clefts with pied-piping. In the second, two different types of complex correlate-remnant pairs received high acceptability scores despite the assumption that only remnant which-phrases produce that effect. Taken together, these data speak against including Polish among languages that lend support to Merchant (2001).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001081/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001081<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sluicing, clefts, preposisition omission, linguistic complexity, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>282 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001081">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001081">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
