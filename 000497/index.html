We first show that the left-dislocation analysis to preverbal Greek subjects does not cover the whole range of empirical facts. More specifically, we claim that besides topicalized preverbal subjects, which are admittedly left-dislocated and therefore out of cycle elements, there exist preverbal subjects that belong to the main syntactic derivation (cycle) and are liable to its operations and conditions. To account for these subjects, we put forward the hypothesis that their syntactic derivation involves a movement operation which targets an EPP Spec,TP position. The major challenge for such a hypothesis is to account for the various patterns of subject distribution which have been observed and documented for Greek. The analysis proposed here builds on a copy approach to movement, as developed by Bokoviæ (2001) and Bobaljik (2002), which states that the syntactic output of the movement operation is the sequence of copies at the positions involved and that the linearization of this chain, i.e. the choice upon which copy is pronounced and interpreted, is a matter of the interfaces and subject to their operations and conditions. It is exactly this latter aspect that the present analysis exploits at full.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000497/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000497<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Shorter version to appear in a special volume of MITWPL on Greek Syntax and Semantics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>subject, phonological phrasing, copy theory, linearization, phonology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>513 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000497">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000497">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
