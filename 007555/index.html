Evidentiality is also among one of the most well-studied phenomena empiric- ally, with an extensive body of work describing diverse crosslinguistic patterns. Almost overwhelmingly, this body of work has been about propositional evidentiality, i.e. evidentials that have scope over a proposition and provide information about how that proposition came to be available to the agent. In this chapter, my goal will be to provide an approach to evidentiality that incorporates both propositional as well as non-propositional evidentiality (henceforth, PE and NPE, respectively). The difference between the two types is located in their scope. Propositional evidentials have sentential scope (syntactically they can only appear with finite clauses; see Bhadra 2018), and signal the particular flavor of evidence (sensory, inference, report) for the propositional content. Non-propositional evidentials scope over subsentential constituents (overwhelmingly noun phrases; Aikhenvald 2004; Jacques 2018), are fused with the determiner/demonstrative paradigms or with nominal tense markers, and mostly favor sensory perception. With the sparse body of work on NPE (when compared to PE), several questions have remained unanswered: why does such a fundamental divide exist among languages with PE and NPE? More succinctly, what is it about nominals that favors only sensory perception? What can a unified view of evidentiality look like to capture its interactions with temporal categories like tense, and spatial categories like demonstratives/determiners? I will attempt to address some of these issues through the main question I will pursue: what is at the semantic core of an evidential? This work provides the first comparative formal semantic account of perception of nominals and propositions that tackles these questions, and adds another dimension: temporality.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007555/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007555<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistics Meets Philosophy, Cambridge University Press</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>372 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007555">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007555">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
