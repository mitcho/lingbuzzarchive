Relatives and LD structures demonstrate many distinct syntactic and semantic properties when they contain a gap and a resumptive pronoun respectively. A thorough study of the relevant data reveals that when a gap strategy is adopted, island effects and crossover effects are always observed, irrespective of whether the relevant gap is embedded within a relative clause or within an LD structure; on the contrary, when the resumptive strategy is adopted, a sharp distinction is observed between these two structures. A resumptive relative clause gives rise to island effects and crossover effects systematically; in contrast, a resumptive LD structure never gives rise to these effects. In the Minimalist Program, island effects and crossover effects are not exclusively used as diagnostic tests for movement since the operation Agree is also subject to the locality constraints. I will argue that a relative clause containing either a gap and an RP and an LD structure with gap are derived by Agree and they are subject to the locality condition whereas a resumptive LD structure is derived by Match that is an island free operation and it is not subject to the locality constraint. Multiple Transfer and multiple Spell-Out are possible in an Agree chain, but not in a Matching chain. The choice of the derivational mechanism depends on the interpretability of the formal features attached to the Probe and to the Goal in the relevant A'-dependencies.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002417/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002417<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>International Journal of Chinese Linguistics: Volume 3, Issue 1</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>resumptive pronoun, gap, a'-dependency, relatives, left-dislocation, agree, minimalist program, chinese, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002417/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2363 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002417">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002417">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
