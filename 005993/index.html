The unsettledness presupposition can be exploited by canny interlocutors. Here I examine a case where the U.S. president turned this presupposition to his conversational advantage during a press conference, refusing to answer a reporter's question in order to avoid a normative bind. I suggest that the questionâ€“answer dialogue here can be profitably analyzed within the framework for insinuation developed by Camp (2018), and consider some consequences for participants in public conversational settings.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005993/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005993<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantics, pragmatics, political communication, questions, insinuation, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>222 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005993">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005993">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
