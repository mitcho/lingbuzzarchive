Nevertheless I believe that this study still has something to offer, even today. The first part of the study provides a concise and accessible overview of government and movement theory as it has developed in the eighties and early nineties: as some knowledge of this is needed to fully appreciate the current minimalist view on locality it may provide useful background to all newcomers in the field. But the main interest for present-day research probably lies in the second and third part, which handle a set of non-local dependencies like agreement, case assignment, binding and tense linking, as well as intervention effects (or rather the lack thereof). 



In a sense the notion of chain-government can be seen as a predecessor of the notion Agree in present-day linguistics, by which the theory has reintroduced non-local relationships, which were supposed to be abandoned by the eliminating the notion of government.
