We address this fundamental question in Kalaḅarị-Ịjọ, a language spoken in southern Nigeria, wherein a class of clitics triggers a ‘low tone spread’ process targeting high tones (e.g. the clitic à ‘I’ in /à páḅụ́rụ́ tẹ́ꜜẹ́/ → [à pàḅụ̀rụ̀ tẹ́ꜜẹ́] ‘I have stammered’). We provide the first comprehensive description of this process, establishing that its only triggers are a small class of prosodically deficient pronominal clitics, all of which are low-toned, monosyllabic, and onsetless. We claim that these properties together prevent it from being parsed as a separate phonological word (i.e. they are sub-minimal), and instead the low tone of these clitics must tonally incorporate into a neighboring prosodic domain. We argue that the domain for low tone spread is the phonological phrase, and show independent evidence for this exact constituent from grammatical tone. Finally, low tone spread is unbounded, targeting all continuous high tones within the relevant domain. We attribute its unbounded nature to a consequence of tonal incorporation: this creates new LHH sequences which are marked in the language. We catalogue the independent evidence for a *LHH tonotactic constraint operating at different prosodic levels, and demonstrate low tone spread as one additional response to such a sequence. We end our paper by discussing contexts where a phrase-level *LHH constraint appears to be tolerated, which we would expect to be subject to tone spread as well. We take such data as showing that low tone spread constitutes a phonologically derived environment effect: unbounded spread only takes place if some other phonological operation (e.g. tonal incorporation) takes place first. In total, our Kalaḅarị-Ịjọ study demonstrates that tone spread can profitably be decomposed into several sub-operations triggered by multiple interacting factors (here, word-minimality, prosodic constituency, and *LHH tonotactics). <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007548/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007548<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted [Authors should be: Nicholas ROLLE (Leibniz-ZAS, Berlin) & Otelemate HARRY (University of the West Indies, Mona)]</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>clitics; prosody; tone; spreading; word minimality; prosodic constituency; tonotactics, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>132 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007548">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007548">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
