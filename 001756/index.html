Te Winkel took the second opposition in terms of the absence or presence of a temporal auxiliary ‘zullen’ (will). However, in a binary system Future looses the status it has in a ternary analysis as being at the same level as Past and Present. The present paper shows that Present and Past already may express posterior information, there being no temporal role for ‘zullen’ (will). Grice’s Maxim of Quantity determines which sort of interpretation (current or posterior) is to be associated with Present or Past. The infinitival form of ‘zullen’ (will) should be seen as an epistemic modal operator with a specific role in the interaction between speaker and hearer. This operator will be argued to be positioned between the first and the third opposition. The binary approach is not restricted to Dutch and so it points to a fundamental flaw in Kissine (2008) which proposed that the English auxiliary ‘will’ is (only) temporal.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001756/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001756<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Natural Language & Linguistic Theory (2014)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>binary tense, epistemic modality, possible world semantics, maxim of quantity, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001756/v2.pdf">v2 [June 2013]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001756/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2013]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1271 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001756">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001756">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
