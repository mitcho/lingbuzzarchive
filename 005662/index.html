I discuss the available data and the methodology of my synthesis of it, and I add the elicitation results of my recent fieldwork. I describe three distinct address systems: hierarchical T-V (plurals are directed to superiors as a V form), gendered T-V (plurals are directed to women and girls as a V form) and non-dual (the singular marker is missing in all paradigms, the plural form is the only address pronoun and does not realize a formal marker, â€ V). I map these systems to their respective territories of usage. I analyse the diachronic evolution and the cross-influences of these three systems over the last century. Most of the speakers in a central and south area are restricted to a unique address pronoun, like Modern English you. This system gains ground towards the coasts, where a distinctive T address among male close friends or relatives gives rise to a T-V gendered system like in Welsh (Watkins 1977). In the remaining North and South-East areas, a hierarchical T-V system organized around age and social status
resists much more to the extension of the central area. I present evidence for independent subsystems inside both T-V systems: addresses to animals, to clergymen and God. Occasional inversion of an expected marker serves emotionally charged interactions (aggressive T, hypocoristic V).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005662/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005662<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Lublin</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dialectology, politeness systems, systems of address, breton, celtic, t-v systems, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005662/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>493 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005662">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005662">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
