Twenty adverts were recorded from British TV channels and analysed combining auditory analysis with a visual inspection of F0 contours/traces. The rates of occurrence of five types of tone (fall, rise, fall-rise, rise-fall, and level) were calculated for four utterance types (declaratives, questions, exclamatives, and imperatives). Results show that declaratives exhibit falling tones in most cases, followed by exclamatives and imperatives. Moreover, the rates of occurrence of tone types in exclamatives and imperatives generally mirror those in declaratives, compound tones being rare across all utterance types. An explanation of the presence or absence of a given tone in a specific grammatical structure is provided by relating tone
