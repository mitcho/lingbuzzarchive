The primary goal of this dissertation is to demonstrate that perspective plays a vital role in syntactic domain formation and various syntactic processes based on data from Turkish complementation. I argue that the two CP-level complement clauses in Turkish differ from each other in whether they encode perspective. This difference, in turn, leads to various syntactic differences such that availability of syntactic encoding of perspective forms an opaque domain, as evidenced by the ban on binding, NPI-licensing, among other patterns. However, the opaqueness is not absolute but is rather selective (Keine 2019), as evidenced by the ability of topic-related elements to escape perspectival domains, including what was earlier considered to be indexical shift cases in Turkish. The investigation of the interaction of embedded perspectival domains with various embedding cognitive attitude verbs reveal important patterns that lead to the conclusion that Turkish makes a three-way syntactic distinction based on perspective between these verbs: speaker-oriented verbs, matrix subject-oriented verbs and perspective-underspecified verbs. I correlate perspective with (non)factivity such that factive reading is a result of syntactic encoding of the speaker’s perspective; non-factivity is a result of encoding the matrix subject’s perspective, and lack of perspective specification leads to what is known as semi-factive verbs.  I show that matrix subject-oriented verbs turn embedded opaque domains such as perspectival domains into transparent domains while speaker-oriented verbs turn otherwise-transparent domains into opaque domains. I attribute this to the specific properties of the extra structure they both introduce. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006687/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006687<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Southern California, Dissertation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>perspective, syntax, turkish, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>370 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006687">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006687">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
