Comparing across nouns and accounting for the ontological class of the noun’s referent (focusing on nouns denoting artifacts, natural kinds, occupations, humans, and locations), I find that Percent Possessive is positively correlated with a noun’s per-million word frequency. Comparing across different web communities, I find that a noun is more frequent, and shows a greater ratio of definite to indefinite tokens, in the community where its Percent Possessive is significantly higher. I take these findings to be consistent with the claim that a noun is more easily interpreted as relational (as measured by Percent Possessive) when human interaction with its referent is more conventional (as measured by its frequency and definite-to-indefinite ratio). Inspired by the many authors who have suggested a socio-cultural component to relationality and possession, this paper explores at scale in English how nouns reflect the conventions of the people who use them.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006543/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006543<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>accepted at English Language and Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>relational nouns, possession, lexical semantics, corpus linguistics, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>253 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006543">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006543">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
