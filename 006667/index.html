However, in restricted cases in particular languages, first person agreement is also discontinuous. I discuss two types of first person discontinuities. The first manifests the hallmarks of a meta split, persisting across paradigms and exponents. I argue that this type of first person discontinuity arises due to postsyntactic Fission which separates antagonistic sets of features prior to insertion and which is driven by markedness constraints on feature coexponence. The second type of first person discontinuity is restricted to a single paradigm and does not evince true discontinuous bleeding effects. Such discontinuities are best captured via morphological Doubling, modeled via Generalized Reduplication. First person discontinuities thus provide strong empirical support for the autonomy of morpheme splitting rules and morpheme copying rules. I demonstrate that each type of rule has a distinct empirical signature and acts as a repair to a different kind of morphotactic constraint. Consequently, there must be more than one route to discontinuous agreement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006667/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006667<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Brill's Journal of Afroasiatic Languages and Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>morphology; discontinuous agreement; modularity; fission; displacement; doubling; markedness; semitic, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006667/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>833 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006667">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006667">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
