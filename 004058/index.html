Integrating these two views we suggest that assertion speech acts should be themselves modeled as gradable, and more specifically, that the covert speech act operator ASSERT denotes a (credence) degree relation, and is modifiable by overt and covert degree modifiers, manipulating this degree. 
We show that such a view enables capturing newly observed parallels between overt and covert degree modification of adjectives at the propositional level and some overt and covert modifiers of assertion speech acts. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004058/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004058<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of NELS48</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>speech acts, assertions, gradability, degree modifiers, positive form, modal  epsitemic adverbs, credence, probability, response partilces, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>283 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004058">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004058">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
