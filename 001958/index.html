Here I suggest that looking at the elementary restrictions that apply to free Merge (i.e. selection and licensing of functional features), we could conclude that a re-orientation of the syntactic derivation (from bottom-up/right-left to top-down/left-right) is necessary to make the theory simpler, especially for long-distance (filler-gap) dependencies, and empirically more adequate: if our structure building operations would roughly assemble lexical items in the order they were pronounced (Phillips 1996, Chesi 2004-2012 a.o.), on-line performance data could better fit the grammatical model, without resorting to external “performance factors”. The phase-based, top-down (and, as consequence, left-right) Minimalist Grammar here discussed goes in this direction, ultimately showing how Strong Islands (Huang 1982) and intervention effects (Gordon et al. 2001) could be better explained in structural terms assuming this unconventional derivational direction.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001958/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001958<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Psycholinguistic Research</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>top-down, left-right, merge, move, phases, nesting, selection, derivations, computational complexity, intervention, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>410 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001958">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001958">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
