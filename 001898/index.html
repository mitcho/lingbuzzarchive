It is shown that previous restructuring approaches raise several questions regarding both the properties of infinitives in Tagalog and the situation of Tagalog infinitives within restructuring cross-linguistically. Instead, the paper proposes an alternative movement analysis according to which Tagalog allows for the option of backward raising and backward control. Since movement constitutes a central part of the analysis, the paper also provides a detailed account of locality and the general conditions on extraction in Tagalog which derives the distribution of movement from infinitives in three dialects of Tagalog. The account is built on the concept of phase-extension triggered by verb movement and offers a new way to derive the voice marking system of Tagalog and the extraction restrictions related to voice marking. To account for various extraction asymmetries found in Tagalog infinitives, a PF evaluation approach to locality and other syntactic violations is adopted, which, in addition to covering differences between raising and control, movement of full NPs and clitics, and other extraction phenomena in Tagalog also provides a way to implement movement restrictions such as improper movement, competition among different elements at the phase edge, and various intervention effects.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001898/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001898<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>tagalog, infinitives, voice marking, raising, control, restructuring, backward movement, phase extension, locality, clitics, phase edge, agree, (rescue by) pf-deletion, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2642 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001898">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001898">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
