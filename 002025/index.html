Research has tried to determine which one of these two meanings is basic. Focusing on coordination of nouns ("liar and cheat"), this paper argues that the basic meaning of "and" is intersective. This theory has been successfully applied to coordination of other kinds of constituents (Partee and Rooth, 1983; Winter, 2001). Certain cases of collective coordination ("cat and dog", "men and women") are considered a challenge for this view, and for this reason the collective theory has been argued to be superior (Heycock and Zamparelli, 2005). The main result of this paper is that the intersective theory actually predicts the collective behavior of "and" in these cases, due to the way it interacts with certain silent operators involving set minimization and choice functions. These operators are believed to be present in the grammar on the basis of phenomena involving indefinites and collective predicates, and they have been argued to cause collective interpretations in coordinations of noun phrases (Winter, 2001). This paper also shows that the collective theory does not generalize to coordinations of noun phrases in the way it was suggested by its proponents.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002025/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002025<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002025">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002025</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Semantics: http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jos/ffv008 First published online July 31, 2015.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>coordination, plurals, collectivity, distributivity, choice functions, numerals, type shifting, boolean semantics, hydras, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002025/v6.pdf">v6 [June 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002025/v5.pdf">v5 [June 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002025/v4.pdf">v4 [March 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002025/v3.pdf">v3 [February 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002025/v2.pdf">v2 [December 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002025/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2765 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002025">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002025">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
