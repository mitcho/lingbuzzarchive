What all adverbs have in common is that they modify a non-nominal head. This head may be lexical in nature, such as an adjective modified by a degree adverb, or syntactic, such as a full clause modified by an evidential adverb. In this chapter, adverbs are classified in terms of the types of head they modify, which will lead to a systematic classification of adverb classes that have been identified individually in the literature. It is furthermore shown that this classification provides the basis for a series of generalizations concerning the form and behaviour of classes of adverbs. These generalizations are formulated using the theoretical framework of Functional Discourse Grammar.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005603/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005603<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>adverb, lexical head, syntactic head, functional discourse grammar, semantic scope, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005603/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>997 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005603">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005603">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
