In this article I argue against this hypothesis by critically reanalyzing the original arguments for PredP (coordination of unlikes, movement of the predicate, case marking on the predicate, etc.), examining whether there is any semantic support for mediated predication and reviewing the putative cross-linguistic evidence for overt equivalence of Pred0. I first demonstrate that the facts that used to be taken as requiring the presence of a functional head in small clauses can now be accounted for by independently needed assumptions, such as Raising to Object and semantic types. I then show that standard Montagovian semantics treating NPs, APs and PPs as unsaturated functions does not require a mediating projection and that alternative attempts to endow Pred0 with some interpretation either fail or cannot be used as motivation for postulating such a mediating projection. Finally, I address copular particles and other "overt predicators", providing evidence that their syntax is different from that expected of Pred0 in nontrivial ways, which means that they also cannot be taken as prima facie evidence for its postulation. I sketch an alternative theory linking the use of predicative particles to nominal predication and provide evidence for it from cross-linguistic lexicalization patterns of copular particles. To summarize, neither theory-internal considerations nor cross-linguistic data require the presence of a mediating functional head in small clauses, and therefore the PredP hypothesis should probably be abandoned.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003756/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003756<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Inquiry (to appear)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>predp, predication, small clauses, copular particles, copulas, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>663 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003756">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003756">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
