In §3.1, I present two rather different accounts of variable Word Orders found at the proposed pre-functional stage of language acquisition: (i) Tsimpli (1992), and (ii) a weakened version of Kayne (1995). The main thrust behind the two proposals leads me to conclude that at the very earliest stage of language development, there seems to be some evidence to suggest that some aspects of language principles (typically those associated with LAD) might be subject to maturation (§3.2). In §3.3, I examine my data.

Preview. Following Kayne’s LCA, I come to the conclusion that Word Order is indeed a universal hierarchical property of a Spec>Head>Comp relation. However, this, in itself, is not enough to account for the wide array of word order errors found in the early data. Adopting Kayne’s ‘head medial principle’, I consequently devise a two-pronged model for dealing with the variable word 
order patterns found at this initial two-word phase of development—referred to here as ‘single argument strings’ (SAS); (viz., the phase at which children’s speech chiefly consists of one argument; cf. Bowerman 1990). The core assumptions underlying this model are the following: first, that all 
‘heads’ must be base-generated in medial position (a ‘Head-medial constraint’); second, that there exists a ‘complement parameter’ which endeavors to set the Object, here, interpreted as being initially hosted within a non-agreeing Spec position (cf. Larson), either leftward or rightward of the head. As a 
result, this parameter leads to the eventual correct positioning of the agreeing Specifier that must then enter into an agreement relation with V within a given DAS structure. I subsequently conclude that it is the onset of the ‘double argument string’ (DAS) phase which triggers not only Kayne’s weakened version of LCA, but, more theoretically, establishes the (Larsonian) VP-shell which provides important A'-bar positions to movement. In one sense, the core of the SAS-phase could be considered as the lexical-thematic stage par excellence.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008227/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008227<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Essex</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>child syntax, word order, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>185 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008227">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008227">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
