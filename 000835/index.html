On the basis of Hebrew and English data, this paper motivates a novel generalization: A pronominal copy in the complement is not necessary only if the matrix subject is thematic. This follows if (i) a nonthematic DP must be licensed by predication, (ii) the clausal complement is turned into a predicate by merging with a null operator, and (iii) the pronominal copy is the variable required by the operator. Contra previous analyses, I argue that the complement in copy raising may be propositional, forming an aboutness relation with the subject. When it is predicative, however, a null operator is necessary, since CPs are not natural predicates. The dichotomy between propositional and predicative CPs cuts across the gap/copy distinction, and is manifested in other constructions, also discussed (hanging topic vs. left dislocation, rationale vs. purpose clauses and proleptic object constructions).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000835/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000835<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>predication, copy raising, null operator, perceptual verbs, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>322 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000835">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000835">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
