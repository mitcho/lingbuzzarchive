(i)	They say that John doesnt speak French, but he does.

 Among the null-subject languages which dont allow dropping the pronoun are Chinese (various dialects), Czech, Finnish and European Portuguese.  Among the languages that allow it are Hungarian, Japanese, Persian, and Spanish. An explanation is proposed of this variation, based on the following correlation: The languages which dont allow pro-drop in (i) standardly reply to yes/no questions by repeating the finite verb of the question. The languages which allow pro-drop in (1) standardly reply by using a special affirmation particle yes. The connection between (i) and replies to yes/no questions is that both involve polarity focus. The proposal is that pro-drop in the second conjunct in (i) is prohibited in the languages employing the finite verb answering strategy because of a competition of derivations involving ellipsis.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000234/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000234<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000234">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000234</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>NELS 35</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pro drop, ellipsis, yes/no questions, affirmation, finnish, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>181 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000234">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000234">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
