the one hand, to objective reality and, on the other, to subjective experience, are issues that
have been central to metaethics from its very beginnings. While these complex and
challenging issues have been debated by analytic philosophers for over a century, it is only
relatively recently that more interdisciplinary and empirically-oriented approaches to such
issues have begun to see light. The present chapter aims to make a contribution of that
kind. We will present the results of an empirical – specifically, corpus linguistic – study that
offers evidence that moral predicates exhibit hallmarks of subjectivity at the linguistic level,
but also, that they differ significantly from paradigmatically subjective predicates.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007032/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007032<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>David Bordonaba-Plou (ed.), Experimental Philosophy of Language: Perspectives, Methods and Prospects.
