object and a resumptive strategy for oblique relations such as indirect object
and object of preposition as well as for all positions inside islands. While a
movement analysis is straightforward for gap relatives, there is conﬂicting
evidence concerning the syntax of resumptive relatives: Reconstruction
e¤ects suggest a movement analysis while the insensitivity to locality con-
straints is more compatible with a base-generation account. Recent approaches
have proposed ways of implementing reconstruction under base-generation
while movement approaches have severe di‰culties accounting for the insen-
sitivity to locality. After dismissing most movement approaches to resump-
tion on empirical and conceptual grounds, we ﬁnally consider the possibility
that it is the overtness of the tail in resumption that makes movement out of
islands possible. Resumptives are normally overt in Zurich German and
therefore seem to support this view. Possessive relatives, which on the sur-
face do not employ a resumptive pronoun, are an ideal test case to distin-
guish movement from base-generation. A thorough investigation of the
underlying possessor doubling construction reveals that a small pro can be
licensed in the position of the possessor. Possessor relativization can then
be shown to necessarily involve an empty resumptive pronoun that is bound by a base-generated operator. A movement analysis which makes movement
out of islands possible because of an overt tail crucially fails in this case
because the resumptive is silent. Given that base-generation is required for
possessor relativization, it is most economical to extend it to resumptive
relatives in general. Resumptives thus act as a last resort when grammatical
principles bar movement derivations. But since base-generation is in princi-
ple available, one needs to explain why there are no resumptives for subjects
and direct objects. The base-generation option seems to be blocked by the
movement option, which implies that they compete. This in turn has im-
portant implications for the deﬁnition of the reference set. To explain the
Zurich German facts one has to assume that the reference set is based on
identical LFs rather than identical numerations.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002970/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002970<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In Peter Gallmann & Melanie Wratil (eds.): Null Pronouns.
