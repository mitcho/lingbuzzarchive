The first part of this paper presents evidence for this hypothesis based on locality effects in phonological conditions on the choice of allomorph of the affix /ing/ between [in] and [iN]. A second and more speculative part explores how this view sheds new light on a number of puzzles that earlier accounts of locality in phonology failed to address: Why is it that sandhi processes tend to be variable, and what can this variability tell us about the nature of phrasal phonology? Why is it the case that different kinds of sandhi processes come with different kinds of locality conditions that seem to depend on their phonological substance? Why is it that lexical frequency and collocational cooccurrence seem to be able to affect sandhi processes in addition to syntactic and phonological factors?<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002217/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002217<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>McGill Working Papers 12(1): http://www.mcgill.ca/mcgwpl/files/mcgwpl/wagner2012.pdf</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>allophony, allomorphy, variability, production planning, sandhi, morphology, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1245 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002217">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002217">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
