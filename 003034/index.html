composed of two semantic primitives: an "event template" built
recursively from basic eventive predicates defining the broad temporal
and causal nature of the event, and an idiosyncratic "root" that fills
in the real world details of a given verb's template (Dowty 1979,
Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1995, Harley 2003, inter alia). However, an
open question is whether an ontological semantic distinction between
roots and templates is justified, and in particular whether a verb's
idiosyncratic root can also directly encode basic eventive notions
(contra the Root Hypothesis of Arad 2005 and the Bifurfaction Thesis
of Embick 2009). This paper argues that roots can in fact encode
templatic information, considering as a case study English
ditransitive verbs, which exhibit two argument frames that reflect
their association with two distinct event templates: caused motion in
the "to" frame and caused possession in the double object frame. The
paper shows that these templates are highly underspecified
semantically, and the roots that occur in them flesh out many basic
eventive details that include filling in specific types of changes of
state, an otherwise templatic notion. The paper proposes a
compositional analysis of roots and templates in which their meanings
do not differ ontologically but only in degree of specificity ---
templates encode general eventive meanings, and roots encode specific
eventive meanings that may entail the more general meanings, with the
verb's ultimate meaning arising from subsumption and augmentation
relationships between the two. This keeps with findings in unrelated
empirical domains, where the roots of some change of state verbs have
been shown to introduce templatic entailments of change
(Koontz-Garboden & Beavers 2016) and where the roots of manner of
killing verbs introduce a templatic entailment of causation (Beavers &
Koontz-Garboden 2012).  Nonetheless, the paper still argues that there
are reasons to assume the ontological distinction between roots and
templates, even if the reasons are not truth-conditional in nature.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003034/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003034<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In press in Brendel, Cole, Aaron Kaplan, Abby Kaplan, Miranda McCarvel, Jeff Pynes, and Ed Rubin (Eds.).
