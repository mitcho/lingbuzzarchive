A primary diagnostic is the availability of reconstructed readings. Hence the translation of (1) is licit and appropriate in the circumstance described. It is widely agreed that the superficially similar but base-generated ‘seems as if’ construction must be predicated of a perceptual source (see (2)).

(1) John seems (that) __ is sick. [OK to say upon noting that John is not in class]

(2) John seems like he’s sick. [Needs to be based on John’s behavior or appearance]

We also demonstrate that the reconstructed reading displays a locality sensitivity that is generally diagnostic of movement constructions. The availability of licit translations for the passive-raising in (3) provides strong support for a movement analysis.

(3) John is believed (that) __ has left. [OK in Lusaamia and Lubukusu]

Our account is based on proposals independently motivated and developed in Carstens (2010, 2011) and Diercks (to appear). Carstens argues that grammatical gender feature (uGen) of N is valued but uninterpretable, and hence an “active goal” feature; (ii) that N-to-D adjunction makes it visible to all clause level probes in Bantu; and (iii) that Agree only makes an expression “deactivated’ or “frozen in place” when Case is involved, because subsequent Agree relations lead to potential unclarity regarding how uCase is to be pronounced. These assumptions account for multiple agreement and unusual inversion constructions in Bantu languages. Diercks (to appear) argues that abstract Case is parameterized, and in Bantu is completely absent. Together these proposals explain the hyper-raising constructions with just one addition: recognition of a non-phasal complementizer. Lubukusu and Lusaamia have several Cs, only one of which can appear in hyper-raising constructions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001447/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001447<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the North East Linguistic Society, Seda Kan, Claire Moore-Cantwell, Robert Staubs (eds), 99-118.
