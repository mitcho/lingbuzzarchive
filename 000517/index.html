Standing at the intersection between syntax, lexical and clausal semantics and morphology, it has been the subject of intense research since the late 1970s and has played a role in several important theoretical developments and debates.  Auxiliary selection also poses a number of empirical questions.  Even within a single language, the correct description of the alternation can be controversial, and the extensive cross-linguistic variation has turned out to be rather difficult to characterize in a systematic way.  In this article, I give a survey of how our understanding of auxiliary selection has developed, both on the empirical and the theoretical side.  I also include a brief discussion of work on how patterns of selection arise and change over time.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000517/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000517<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>auxiliary selection, perfect, have, be, auxiliary verbs, periphrasis, tense, aspect, unaccusativity, argument structure, aktionsart, telicity, auxiliary selection hierarchy, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1811 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000517">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000517">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
