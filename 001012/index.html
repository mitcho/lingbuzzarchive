These produce the surface effect of

movement (cf. Chomsky 1998) but without an aggressive and over-generative

operation (i.e. MOVE). Like Wh-Movement, we claim that CV-metathesis derivation

could he halted at two logical points: post AGREE and pre I-MERGE, and post

AGREE and post I-MERGE. The latter is full CV-metathesis while the hypothesised

intermediate step surfaces as an echo vowel. After hypothesising this link, we proceed to locate the trigger for these processes with the understanding that two derivational analogues should be triggered identically. Looking at Leti and Balantak we come to the firm conclusion that CV-metathesis and echo vowel formation are both triggered by violations of the ECP, where un-p-licensed empty nuclei are always the locus of both echo vowels and CV-metathesis. We then turn to diachrony, where Southern Nyungar and Tsou show us, (respectively) that CV-metathesis can be triggered by an ECP violation and that echo vowels have been an intermediate step in the acquisition of full CV-metathesis. We conclude with some implications our theory has for the careful examination of phonological operations.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001012/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001012<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>incorporating reviewer comments, Lingua.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>echo vowels, cv metathesis, government phonology, minimalist phonology, operations of phonological computation, move, agree, merge, phonology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001012/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2008]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>300 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001012">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001012">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
