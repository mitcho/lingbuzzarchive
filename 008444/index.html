When it has a future meaning, it does not require an attitude holder, and is thus compatible with inanimate subjects which cannot have desires. Through original fieldwork from Colloquial Jakarta Indonesian, we present some newly observed restrictions on the use of `mau' as a future marker. More specifically, we argue that it behaves like a weak positive polarity item, since it cannot be directly negated. Negating `mau' amounts to negating ‘want’ rather than ‘will’. Additionally, the distribution of mau as ‘will’ is more restricted than that of the regular colloquial version of ‘will’, bakal. We propose to characterize this via a requirement that the subject of mau as ‘will’ is disposed to causing the future event. We formalize this as a presupposition, using the notion of dispositional causation described in Copley (2018). This paper contributes to the understanding of the use of `mau' as a future modal in Indonesian, as well as shows that in Indonesian ‘want’ can synchronically mean ‘will’, a change which is diachronically attested in many languages (e.g.,Bybee and Pagliuca (1987); Bybee and Dahl (1989); Nesselhauf (2012); Heine (2017) a.o.).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008444/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008444<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the 30th annual meeting of the Austronesian Formal Linguistics Association (AFLA 30), Lund University, Sweden.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>indonesian, want, will, desire verbs, future tense, causation, dispositional will, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>14 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008444">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008444">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
