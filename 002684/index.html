This syntax-semantics mapping is best revealed under perception verbs. Epistemically positive perception reports (Barwise 1981)—so-called indirect perception reports—are expressed by finite CPs (as in the Italian example in (Gianni saw from the tears that Maria was crying, #but thought she was laughing)), whereas epistemically neutral perception reports are expressed with infinitives (Gianni saw Maria crying but thought she was laughing). In this short report, we show that Pseudo-Relatives — while finite — give rise to direct perception like infinitives. We provide novel evidence, however, that PRs differ from infinitives in being referential descriptions of situations rather than being existentially quantified (Higginbotham 1983). We then propose, based on independent syntactic evidence, that PRs are headed by a determiner that is responsible for the low type of PRs compared to ‘normal’ finite clauses.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002684/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002684<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of NELS 45</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>perceptual reports; pseudo relatives; infinitives, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1660 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002684">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002684">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
