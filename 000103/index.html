The distribution of this morpheme is of interest because it is intermediate between that of what might be called a 'lexical' causative, and that of a syntactic causative which takes a clausal complement. I will argue that a uniform treatment may be given for l- in structural terms; that is, that its distribution is determined by syntactic considerations, such that it always appears as a causative (light) verbal head with the same type of complement. The analysis I propose provides an identical syntactic treatment for two sets of environments, one of which exhibits idiosyncrasies associated with Lexical processes, and one of which does not; this raises questions concerning the applicability of a syntactic account for all of the cases in question. I thus devote the concluding sections of the paper to a discussion of the resolution to this question, and its implications for the relationship between syntax and argument structure. In addition, I discuss the implications of the discussion for analyses of the Transitivity Alternation, focussing on questions surrounding the morphology found in intransitive/transitive pairs.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000103/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000103<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dm, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>973 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000103">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000103">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
