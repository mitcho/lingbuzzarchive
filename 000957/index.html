I have argued that these diminutives are created by recursive application of the suffix -ek whose initial vowel e alternates with zero. Diachronically speaking, the -eèek diminutives display both patterns of V-zero alternations that are found in languages: in OCz they followed the Havlík pattern, where alternants are in complementary distribution (dom&#248;èek), while in MoCz they follow the Lower pattern, where strong alternants (i.e. vowels) are always preceded by strong alternants (domeèek).

Although V-zero alternations have been widely discussed in the Slavic generative literature, no comprehensive analysis of the Havlík-Lower variation is found. Typically, the literature only mentions the Lower pattern which is found in modern Slavic languages (besides in Czech, e.g. in Polish or Russian). 

The analysis of the Havlík-to-Lower change presented follows Rubachs (1984) classical analysis where the Lower pattern is derived from the cyclic application of the Lower rule; in modern terminology, this means that the Lower pattern has internal phase structure (while the Havlík pattern has not). I argue that in the Lower pattern all floating vowels in a row (except the last one) vocalize because each of them is immediately followed by an empty nucleus, an empty nucleus at the phase boundary. Furthermore, the comparison of OCz and MoCz double diminutives, which both display the same morphosyntactic features, indicates that phasehood is a lexical property, i.e. a property of the particular lexical item, namely the diminutive suffix  -ek. From this perspective, the Havlík to Lower change consists in a change of the properties of the lexicon: in MoCz, the suffix  ek is lexically specified as a phase trigger whose insertion into the appropriate morphosyntactic node initiates derivation of its sister node. By contrast in OCz the diminutive  ek did not trigger any phase.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000957/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000957<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the Czech in Formal Grammar conference</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>vowel-zero alternations, double diminutives, czech, havliks law, lower, diachronic change, phase-triggering affixes, government phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>163 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000957">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000957">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
