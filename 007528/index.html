The focus is on identifying the underlying patterns of how presuppositions project out of two binary connectives, if and or, by disentangling semantic presuppositions from additional processes. A series of behavioral experiments examine how English-speaking adults process presuppositional sentences in real time, and what children in the preschool age range know about presupposition projection in these constructions, finding a host of evidence in favor of a family of theories that take an asymmetric view of presupposition projection. 

Ultimately, I defend an asymmetric view of presupposition projection, as advocated by Satisfaction Theory and Trivalent Logics. The experimental findings provide novel empirical support that corroborates the predictions of these theories: for presuppositions projected out of binary connectives, the basic, semantic pattern of projection is asymmetric in nature, with a stronger presupposition projected from the left argument than the right argument. These findings together with a better understanding of the general pragmatic principles that affect discourse structure, provide further empirical and theoretical challenges that will need to be addressed by opposing theories.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007528/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007528<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>MIT Dissertation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>presupposition, projection, processing, experimental semantics, experimental pragmatics, child language, question under discussion, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007528/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>424 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007528">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007528">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
