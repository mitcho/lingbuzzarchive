It has been previously observed the when the subject of an unaccusative is incorporated, agreement with the subject is found on the verb, in contrast to Baker’s famous observation in Mohawk that agreement and noun incorporation are in complementary distribution when the object is incorporated. The novel asymmetry reported here is that wh-movement is possible only with incorporated subjects, and not with incorporated objects. I propose that Northern Iroquoian languages have distinct subject and object agreement Probes (contra Béjar & Rezac, 2009), that differ in their prespecification (in the sense of Béjar, 2003). These two distinct Probes account for the two asymmetries noted here. This analysis has implications for theories of polysynthesis.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003394/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003394<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>noun incorporation, subject/object asymmetry, agreement, iroquoian, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>269 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003394">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003394">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
