In MP, movements are typically viewed as taking place in the presence of a formal feature, which leads to the characterization of movement operations as last resort. If all movements are to be characterized in this way, optional operations should never occur. Nevertheless, there is a class of operations, QR in languages such as English and a subclass of scrambling in languages such as Japanese, which appear to be truly optional. We need to formulate a theory of optional operations that is consonant with the tenets of last resort. I will adopt FoxÂ’s (1995, 2000) approach to optional movement, showing its advantages, but at the same time, fleshing out the issues in this approach in order to sharpen the assumptions and expand the range of empirical phenomena that it can account for.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001201/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001201<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Oxford UP</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>movement, epp, optionality, qr, scrambling, quantifier scope, pair list reading, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>153 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001201">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001201">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
