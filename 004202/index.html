The that-trace effect is a constraint where subjects cannot extract long-distance without deletion of the complementizer "that". The anti-that-trace effect is a lesser-known inverse of this constraint, where "that" cannot be deleted when the subject undergoes short-distance movement. The major proposal of this paper redefines Agree to capture both effects. Agree evaluates the output of Merge, and, like Label, Agree cannot “see” traces/lower copies. Therefore, if the subject extracts, it will be invisible, leaving ϕ-features of C (=that) unvalued. Following Chomsky (2015), an operation of “phase-cancellation” (=that-deletion) may apply, allowing Agree to check uϕ on C prior to movement. This is the that-trace effect. If the subject extracts short-distance, however, phase-cancellation is prohibited, since short subject movement would potentially violate antilocality. This is the anti-that-trace effect. In addition, I propose that if uϕ remain unvalued within a phase, Feature Inheritance is not required, and said features may be valued on C in the next phase. This is termed Delayed Agree, and I extend the account to capture so-called anti-agreement effects in Berber and other languages, where ϕ-agreement is disrupted in the context of short subject movement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004202/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004202<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the 47th Meeting of the Northeast Linguistics Society (NELS47)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>that-trace effect, anti-that-trace effect, anti-agreement, phases, agree, movement, merge, labeling, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>205 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004202">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004202">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
