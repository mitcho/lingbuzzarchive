However it has never been applied to the classic case of A-movement with

passives.  We present arguments that show that covert movement must

apply within passive nominalizations.  It assimilates to Movement to the Edge

in modern terms.  It supports the perspective that morphology allows a full range

of syntactic operations and therefore no boundary exists between syntax and

morphology.   

 We find that there is a sharp contrast

between:

		a. the learnability of grammar by children

		b. *childrens learnability of grammar

if we assume that the passive ability affix requires object to subject

movement then it occurs acceptably overtly:

		c. grammars learnability by children

If we assume that it occurs covertly as well, then the presence of a hidden

object movement explains why an Agent cannot occur in that position, nor

even a temporal.  Note the contrast between:

		d. the deniability of tenure last year

		e. *last years deniability of tenure

The explanation of these nominalizations enables us to explain why the

optionally passive form is acceptable: the citys destruction by the enemy

and why the non-passive form is impossible: *the citys destroying.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000068/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000068<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Handbook of Morphology, Kluwer eds.
