Syllable-based accounts state that light [l] occurs in onsets (e.g. _light_) and dark [l] in codas (e.g. _dull_). However, several studies, notably Hayes (2000), report overapplication of darkening to onset /l/ in certain morphosyntactically defined positions: e.g. word-finally in phrases such as _heal it_, and stem-finally before a suffix in words such as _heal-ing_.  These onset-position dark [l]s show that /l/-darkening is not just variable, but also sensitive to morphosyntactic structure.  This fact poses a particularly tough challenge for phonological theory: an adequate account of English /l/-darkening presupposes both a theory of the grammatical representation of phonological variation and a theory of the morphosyntax-phonology interface. 

Boersma & Hayes (2001) approach this problem by modelling Hayes's data in Stochastic Optimality Theory, using Output-Output Correspondence as their theory of the morphosyntax-phonology interface.  However, their approach is problematic as it predicts impossible grammars that can only be avoided by means of innate ranking stipulations.  Accordingly, this paper presents a reanalysis of Hayes's data using a novel combination of Stochastic and Stratal OT. I argue that this analysis is an improvement on Boersma & Hayes's parallel stochastic model because it does not rely on fixed innate constraint rankings and it does not generate impossible grammars. Moreover, I show that observations about the life cycle of phonological processes enable us to deduce quantitative predictions about the rate of /l/-darkening in different environments: in particular, the process should apply with lower frequency in smaller morphosyntactic domains, where it has been active for shorter periods of time. This prediction is corroborated by new data obtained by means of a novel method for determining cycle-specific rates of application of variable phonological processes.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001524/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001524<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Manchester</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ssot, /l/-darkening, variation, stochastic ot, stratal ot, variation in ot, life cycle of phonological processes, the russian doll theorem, phonology, morphology, morphosyntactic domains, opacity, ooc, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1619 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001524">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001524">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
