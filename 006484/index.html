We empirically note that, against the traditional hypothesis that in the passage from Latin to Romance older synthetic forms were extensively replaced by novel analytic formations, there is a set of old Romanian periphrastic constructions which disappeared in the passage to modern Romanian, and we set our goal to provide an explanation for this less frequent linguistic change. By bringing to the fore data from old and modern Romanian, as well as dialectal Daco-Romanian material, we show that the facts are best explained by appealing to structural factors (i.e. the feature matrix of Romanian auxiliaries) rather than functional factors (competition between functionally equivalent forms, learn√®d nature, or rare occurrence in usage)<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006484/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006484<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Periphrasis and Inflexion in Diachrony.
