defining characteristic of German inherent dative arguments is not

morphological but syntactic.  On the one hand, evidence is mounting

that dative objects with two-place verbs, as well as those with

three-place verbs, differ in their argument-structural status from

direct objects receiving structural accusative case.  On the other

hand, the GB idea that movement is case-driven, which was central to

previous analyses of the behavior of inherent datives under

passivization, has been considerably weakened.  It is proposed instead

that the special syntactic, semantic and morphological properties of

dative arguments should be derived from the way in which they are

introduced into the structure.  This not only accounts for the German

data that form the basis of the discussion, but can also be more

easily extended to languages like Icelandic, which are famously

problematic for the original inherent Case analysis.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000586/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000586<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Datives and Other Cases.
