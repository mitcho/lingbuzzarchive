It is demonstrated that for morphophonological processes such as external sandhi and allomorphy, material adjacent to an ellipsis site cannot “see” ellipsis-internal material. Under the mainstream [E]-based approach to ellipsis, this result indicates that the silence characterizing ellipsis arises early at PF, consistent with non-application of Vocabulary Insertion (and inconsistent with phonological deletion). However, it would also follow straightforwardly if ellipsis sites were sent to the interfaces alone, the moment they are licensed in the syntax (Aelbrecht 2010). This approach, involving what I call the 'Segregated Transfer' of ellipsis sites, is pursued here: beyond the mounting syntactic evidence supporting it, it is shown to be preferable on post-syntactic grounds as well, requiring fewer assumptions to capture the novel findings presented here.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006050/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006050<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in "The derivational timing of ellipsis", ed.
