Such apparently non-compositional uses of expressives raise the questions of (i) how these expressives integrate into the host utterance at various levels of representation, and (ii) what licenses this apparent non-compositionality. Regarding (i), I develop a typology of attitudinal expressions and their meaning components based on how they integrate into larger utterances that includes spoken expressions from English and Russian as well as various "secondary modality" ways of conveying feelings, namely, facial expressions, gestures, and prosody. Regarding (ii), I propose that apparent non-compositionality of expressives is linked to immediacy of the emotional experience they serve as an outlet for. I also show how the different integration patterns of attitudinal expressions as well as the link between immediacy and apparent non-compositionality can be captured in Potts's (2007) expressive semantics.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005003/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005003<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In revision</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>composition, expressives, attitudinal expressions, non-restricting modifiers, supplements, degree modifiers, facial expressions, gestures, prosody, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>251 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005003">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005003">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
