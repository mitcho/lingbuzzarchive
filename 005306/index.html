However, the present corpus data analysis reveals that, under certain structural configurations, number agreement is not always realized on the third-person dative clitic.  In such cases, plural indirect objects appear doubled with a singular clitic when the indirect object is a lexical noun phrase (80% vs. 20%). In this paper, I use conditional inference trees and generalized mixed-effects logistic regression modeling to study the factors that drive this variation in number agreement. The results show significant effects of the intervening direct object on the dative clitic. When the indirect object is a lexical noun phrase, animacy of the indirect object interacts with the number feature of the direct object but the singular clitic is always more likely whenever the direct object is singular, suggesting a type of attraction effect between the direct object and the clitic. In sharp contrast, when the indirect object is realized as a pronoun, full agreement is almost categorical. Importantly, this type of variable agreement appears to be constrained by the structural context where clitic doubling takes place and I argue that these constraints challenge the idea that the dative clitic can receive a uniform analysis and propose that the categorial status of the clitic depends on the structural configuration in which it appears.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005306/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005306<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>spanish, language variation, clitics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005306/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>72 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005306">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005306">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
