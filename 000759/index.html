The two primary claims I make in this paper are: (i) Finite complement clauses are CPs in Turkish as supported by novel data that show that clauses headed by an overt complementizer can have Accusative subjects, and (ii) Accusative subjects do not undergo obligatory raising to the matrix clause, which hosts the licensor of Accusative Case. The key to the analysis is the further observation that subjects of such complement CPs undergo Topicalization in Turkish and thus they occupy the highest position in their clause (i.e., the edge). The main supposition relevant to the analysis is this: A syntactic object SO of a lower locality domain LD1 can establish a licensing relation (Agree, a&#768; la Chomsky 2001) with a licensor L in the next higher locality domain LD2 if SO is at the edge of LD1. Thus, a subject NP moves close enough to its matrix licensor to get its Accusative Case licensed. I argue that observations from Turkish can be successfully analyzed under this assumption adopting the general framework outlined in Chomsky (2001) particularly when united with specific proposals concerning the functional structure of the left periphery.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000759/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000759<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>case, subject, agreement, phase, turkish., syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>729 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000759">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000759">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
