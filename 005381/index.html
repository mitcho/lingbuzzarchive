This commentary examines how the letter has been received in the field and outside of it, in news outlets as well as on social media. The findings are troubling. Our comprehensive review of reactions to the letter shows that not only are Pinker and his supporters spreading demonstrably false claims about the letter, its signatories, and the LSA itself, but that these claims are being repeated uncritically by a great many media outlets. We discuss possible reasons for this state of affairs and provide suggestions for how the field should deal with media attention in the future.
