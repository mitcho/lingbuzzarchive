The grammaticality of a headless relative is determined by two aspects. The first aspect concerns which case wins the case competition and is determined by the case scale in NOM < ACC < DAT. The second aspect concerns whether the winner of the case competition (the internal or the external case) is allowed to surface when it wins the case competition and this differs from language to language. Of the four logically possible languages I show that only three are attested. 
I assume that headless relatives are derived from light-headed relatives, which contain a light head and a relative pronoun. In a headless relative either the light head or the relative pronoun is deleted, which is possible when it is structurally or formally contained in the other element. The variation between languages follows from the internal morphological structure of relative pronouns and the light head, i.e. whether languages have a phi and case feature portmanteau or two separate morphemes and whether languages have syncretic light heads and relative pronouns.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007901/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007901<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Frankfurt am Main: Universit√§tsbibliothek Johann Christian Senckenberg</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>headless relatives, case competition, nanosyntax, case hierarchy, containment, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>286 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007901">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007901">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
