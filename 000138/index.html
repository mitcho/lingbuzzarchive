so-called Extended Projection Principle (EPP). The following main

points are defended: (i) there exist redundancies between EPP-features

and other, independently required mechanisms (such as those for expressing

the properties of Case and Agreement systems, for example);

(ii) appeal to EPP-features in analytical practice is currently (if not ultimately)

uninformative given their ill-understood nature; and (iii) the

best way to understand EPP-features is to avoid analyses which rely on

them, thus offering the potential for focusing attention to phenomena

for which their postulation is truly necessary. To elaborate on the second

point, typical analyses of phenomena for which the EPP is evoked

usually turn out to be a matter of trading in one mystery (e.g. motivation

for certain instances of movement, insertion of expletives, etc.) for

another (e.g. the EPP). The strategy that we recommend here has the

virtue of attempting to remove the mystery for those cases where it can

be, and furthermore offers the possibility?mentioned in (iii)?of isolating

those cases for which the postulation of EPP-features is truly

unavoidable, thus forming a clearer empirical base on which to concentrate

future research. After establishing a little bit of background, we

provide some mechanisms and analyses which avoid EPP-features for

some cases where they have been deployed in the past; we finish with a

summary and some suggested directions for further study.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000138/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000138<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>WCCFL 19 Proceedings (ed.
