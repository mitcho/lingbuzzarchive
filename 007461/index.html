This contrasts them with other SC nominals, whose NP status has been argued for extensively (e.g., Zlatić 1997, Bošković 2008, 2009, Despić 2011). The paper is built around two crucial observations. First, the clausal distribution of these pronouns differs from that of other object nominals; they appear in the preverbal position. Second, the subextraction and modification patterns observed with SC pronominal phrases suggest that they have a richer structure than other nominals--they are DPs. This account has the potential to unify all SC personal pronouns, including clitics, which have independently been argued to move to the same position in the syntax (Bošković 2001). More broadly, the analysis pursued here lends support to accounts that argue against attributing the NP/DP parameter to entire languages, but rather for a view that nominal phrases may come in various sizes within a single language (e.g., Pereltsvaig & Lyutikova 2014, Erschler 2019).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007461/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007461<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Proceedings of IATL 36 (MITWPL)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>np/dp, nominal extended projection, pronoun, serbo-croatian, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>145 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007461">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007461">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
