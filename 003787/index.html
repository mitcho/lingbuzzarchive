It turns out that for fricatives, the ability to become the first member of a branching onset is intimately connected to their place of articulation. In particular, s and other s-like fricatives are predicted to lack this ability, which solves the first part of Kaye's (1992) "magic puzzle": while it remains a mystery (less mystery, but still) why s can form a cluster with any consonant, we now understand *why* sC clusters cannot be branching onsets.

(The proposal is framed within Government Phonology 2.0, but the gist of the proposal, the association between branching onsets and place of articulation, is in fact theory-independent.)<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003787/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003787<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>GPRT 2017, Budapest, November 18</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>branching onsets, consonant clusters, sc clusters, place of articulation, government phonology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>360 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003787">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003787">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
