Abstract nouns have often been left out of consideration, possibly due to the fact that their reference is abstract and the application of some relevant features of count or mass reference, such as cumulativity, divisiveness or atomicity, does not seem to be possible. This
paper presents a thorough study of lexical features of a subset of abstract nouns and their distribution in COCA which suggests that countability in abstract nouns has to be determined relative to their semantic category. Focusing on eventuality denoting nominals which comprise a substantial part of abstract nouns, I argue that these nouns resemble concrete nouns in that
the countability distinctions are expressed in surprising similarity. I find that the core feature underlying the distinction between abstract count and abstract mass nouns is the vagueness of the minimal components, an approach pursued by Chierchia (2010) for concrete nouns. The minimal components of the count eventualities appear to be stable in all precisifications, unlike
those of mass eventualities which are not determined and vary.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005231/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005231<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of Sinn und Bedeutung 24</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>abstract nouns, count/mass distinction, event nominals, annotation mining, corpus studies, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005231/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>646 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005231">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005231">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
