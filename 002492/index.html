Jeffers (1976) and Lightfoot (2002a), among others, have questioned whether syntax can be reconstructed at all, claiming that a fundamental problem exists in applying the techniques of phonological reconstruction to syntax. Others, such as Harris & Campbell (1995) and, following them, Barðdal & Eythórsson (2012), have claimed that the problem does not arise in their frameworks. This paper critically examines the isomorphism between phonological and syntactic reconstruction, made possible by an ‘item-based’ view of syntactic variation as assumed within Minimalist theories of syntax as well as Construction Grammar and others. A case study dealing with the ‘middle voice’ suffix -sk in early North Germanic is presented in support of the approach. While the conclusion drawn is not as pessimistic as that of Lightfoot (2002a), it is argued that the ‘correspondence problem’ is real and that reconstruction of syntax is therefore necessarily more difficult, and speculative, than that of phonology.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002492/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002492<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Diachronica 30(1), 95–122; DOI: 10.1075/dia.30.1.04wal</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntactic reconstruction, cognacy, comparative method, correspondence problem, directionality, historical syntax, regularity, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1265 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002492">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002492">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
