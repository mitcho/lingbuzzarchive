I argue for a view of argument structure where a basic distinction is drawn between the elements carrying encyclopaedic content, the roots, and the syntactic configuration built around functional heads. Argument structure properties exclusively depend on the latter. Furthermore, the syntactic configuration provides the structural semantics of the linguistic expression. I endorse a theory of the syntax-morphology interface like the one proposed in the Distributed Morphology framework: some specific PF operations can disrupt the basic syntax-morphology isomorphism, and cross-linguistic variation shall be defended to depend exclusively on that possible lack of isomorphism between syntax and morphology. The empirical focus is set on the domain of events expressing a transition. I consider Talmys (2000) theory of the cross-linguistic expression of events of change, where a basic divide is drawn between the languages in which the transition can be encoded by a non-verbal element satellite-framed languages and the languages in which the transition cannot be encoded by a non-verbal element verb-framed languages. I couch Talmys theory of transition events within a syntactic theory of argument structure, and I explore a wide range of constructions in Latin either presenting new data or giving a new perspective on data from the Latin linguistics traditionshowing that Latin pertains to the class of satellite-framed languages. Following an idea in Mateu (2002:160) and Mateu & Rigau (2002), I propose that the satellite-/verb-framed distinction is explainable in purely morphophonological terms. In particular, I make use of the theory of PF operations developed by Embick & Noyer (1999, 2001) within the Distributed Morphology framework, together with Hale & Keysers (2002:60f.) and Harleys (2004) theory of conflation, to account for the distinction. Thus, in verb-framed languages the eventive v head lowers, at PF, to the head encoding transition Path and fuses with it, yielding a unique locus for phonological realisation. On the other hand, in satellite-framed languages this Fusion operation does not take place, so v and Path are free to be phonologically realised independently from each other. Finally, I propose a refinement of Talmys typology within the class of satellite-framed languages. First, there are strong satellite-framed languages, like the Germanic languages, where v and Path are not required to form one word, and, thus, allow constructions like adjectival resultative constructions. Second, there are weak satellite-framed languages, like Latin, where v and Path must form one word (if both are realised independently from each other) and disallow, hence, constructions like adjectival resultative constructions. This distinction is accounted for in terms of a v-to-Path (PF) Lowering operation for weak satellite-framed languages, which creates a complex head. A three-way, gradual typology emerges encompassing strong satellite-framed languages (no v-to-Path Lowering and no v-Path Fusion), weak satellite-framed languages (v-to-Path Lowering, no v-Path Fusion) and verb-framed languages (v-to-Path Lowering and v-Path Fusion).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001242/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001242<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Unpublished PhD dissertation.
