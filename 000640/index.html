nominal expressions which denote the speaker or the addressee.  

An example is (1a) which entails (1b) on the relevant interpretation:



(1)	

a. 	This reporter has seen that.

b.	I have seen that.



Another is (2a) which entails (2b):



(2)	

a. 	Is Madam ready to dine now?

b. 	Are you ready to dine now?



Via an intensive study of the pronominal agreement patterns which 

imposters can determine, this work shows that merely taking them 

to be syntactically 3 person nominals with non-3 person meanings 

is untenable.  Rather, we argue that each imposter represents 

a mostly covert complex analysis incorporating a non-3 person 

pronominal core determining the overall denotation, an outer 

DP shell determining subject-verb agreement, as well as a 

predicational nominal determining the difference between 

distinct 1 person imposters like "this reporter" and "the 

present author".



We argue that the study of imposters has major implications 

for the proper characterization of pronominal agreement, 

indicating that it cannot be based on a symmetric relation 

like coindexing. Further, we sketch an asymmetric alternative 

based on the traditional notion of antecedence. It is also 

shown that the properties of imposters have a strong 

impact on the correct approach to the feature relations 

linking coordinate structures to their individual conjuncts.



Other consequences of the study of imposters relate to verb 

phrase deletion, so-called fake indexicals, the analysis of 

reflexives, the underlying nature of 1 and 2 person and 

parallels between imposters and camouflage structures like 

those studied in Collins, Moody and Postal (2008).  

We argue that the notion imposter is key to describing 

the distribution of the curious mixed plural/singular 

reflexive forms ourself/themself.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000640/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000640<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>unpublished</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>person, pronouns, agreement, coindexation, antecedence, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>975 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000640">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000640">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
