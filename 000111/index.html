It is argued, in part contra Carstairs 1987, that a given morpheme may be sensitive either inwards or outwards (i.e., to a morpheme closer to or farther from the root), but that the different directions reflect sensitivity to different types of morphological features, particularly among non-adjacent morphemes. Special attention is paid to allomorphy in the highly complex agreement systems of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages. Finally, it is shown that the particular constellation of asymmetries in the allomorphy investigated follows straightforwardly from certain assumptions about the architecture of the grammar and the nature of morphology, key among which being (i) separation/late-insertion: the phonological strings we call affixes are reflections of prior, abstract derivations- morphology interprets syntactic structures, rather than feeding them, (ii) cyclicity: that this interpretive procedure (vocabulary insertion) proceeds root-outwards, and (iii) rewriting: that as morphosyntactic features are expressed by vocabulary items, those features are used up and no longer a part of the representation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000111/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000111<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dm, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>538 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000111">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000111">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
