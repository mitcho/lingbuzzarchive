other kinds of knowledge in the performance of different abilities and their corresponding
knowledge structures, for example in reading and writing or in comparing
prose and singing. The more difficult study is to gain a better understanding
of how language emerged in our species. Comparative research with other species
focused on communication, especially when expression is vocal and reception is
auditory, may help us to formulate the right questions. In the comparisons in which
the mechanisms of communication and aspects of the underlying knowledge are
learned, another dimension of the research program presents itself. A recent survey
of the field by Nicolas Mathevon maps out some of the main results of this research
in The Voices of Nature: How and Why Animals Communicate (2023). The following
review essay will be selective, as the survey is wide-ranging and covers related
topics that will take us too far, even though they are, ultimately, related.
