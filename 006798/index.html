On the other hand, gradient information-theoretic measures of utility adopted in cognitive modeling have not been tested as measures of relevance in discourse. We begin to fill this gap by experimentally evaluating two gradient measures of relevance in question-answer pairs in comparison to the categorical theory: Entropy Reduction, which measures the degree to which an answer decreases uncertainty about the resolution of the Question Under Discussion (QUD); and KL Divergence, which measures the degree to which an answer changes the probability distribution over the alternatives. Our experiments provide decisive evidence against the categorical theory of relevance, but do not give strong support to any one gradient measure. Both KL Divergence and Entropy Reduction have systematic failure modes, and are less predictive of relevance judgments than comparatively unmotivated measures like the difference between prior and posterior. We outline several criteria for an adequate gradient theory of relevance, and identify candidate measures for future investigation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006798/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006798<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of Sinn und Bedeutung 26</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>qud, information theory, relevance, bayesian, pragmatics, cognitive modeling, entropy, discourse, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>393 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006798">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006798">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
