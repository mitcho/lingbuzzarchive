It contains over 200 maps of some 194 sentences, covering a wide range of syntactic constructions, including dative presentatives, personal datives, extended benefactives, the <i>have yet to</i> construction, the <i>done my homework construction</i>, <i>wicked</i>, <i>hella</i>, the <i>so don’t I</i> construction, the <i>alls</i> construction, the <i>come with</i> construction, <i>fixin’ to</i>, the <i>needs washed</i> construction, non-polarity <i>anymore</i>(aka “positive <i>anymore</i>”), and many others. For each sentence, we also provide some basic demographic information, such as how the sentence judgments varied by age, race, gender, education, and urban/rural classifications. We describe the goals of these surveys, as well as how they were designed, administered, processed, and mapped, along with a brief introduction to the history of the YGDP. In addition to providing a detailed look at syntactic variation in U.S. English to an extent that has previously been unavailable, we hope that this work will be useful in linguistics classrooms at all levels, and will provide the springboard for further, more detailed studies of the individual constructions, geographic regions, and linguistic and social factors connected to syntactic variation in U.S. English. <p><b>Note</b>: We have now made our full dataset available in CSV and R format, in a .zip file which you can download by clicking "file" below (next to "pdf").
