The results support the hypothesis that syntactic dependencies require less processing
effort than discourse-derived dependencies do (Reuland 2001, 2011, Koornneef 2008).
The point is made through the analysis of a novel paradigm in Russian in which a
preposed nominal stranding a numeral can show number connectivity (PAUCAL) with a
gap following the numeral or can appear in a non-agreeing (PLURAL) form:
(1) cathedral-PAUCAL/PLURAL, there were three.PAUCAL__
Numerous syntactic diagnostics confirm that when there is number connectivity, the
nominal has been fronted via A'-movement, creating a syntactic A'-chain dependency. In
the absence of connectivity, the construction involves a hanging topic related via
discourse mechanisms to a base-generated null pronoun. The constructions constitute a
minimal pair and Reuland’s proposals correctly predict that the A'-movement
construction will require less processing effort compared to the hanging topic
construction. A self-paced reading study for contrasting pairs as in (1) showed a
statistically significant slow down after the gap with the hanging topic as opposed to the
moved nominal. We take this to support the claim that a syntactic A'-chain is more easily
processed than an anaphoric dependency involving a null pronoun, which must be
resolved by discourse-based mechanisms.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001559/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001559<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>russian, hanging topic, a'-movement, scrambling, number agreement, anaphoric dependency, processing, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>677 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001559">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001559">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
