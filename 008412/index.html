"just" that covers its exclusive, emphatic/intensifying, precisifying, unexplanatory,
unelaborative, and counter-expectational uses. Drawing on an insight from another
semantic domain, we claim that the chameleon-like behavior of "just" can be made
sense of if we treat it as having a domain-widening function. The key proposal is
as follows: the use of "just" indicates that the speaker is considering the widest set of
alternative answers relevant at the context. The analysis relies on the notion of the
optimal construal of an underspecified question, which makes use of a comparison
between the inquisitivity of questions, modeled as the width of a question. The
optimal construal of a question further depends on its answerability – i.e. whether
the speaker considers a true answer to be accessible at the context (satisfying Quality)
and whether the speaker considers addressing it to be relevant to discourse goals
(satisfying Relevance). The diverse contextual effects of "just" that are observed arise
from the interaction between the way in which the set of alternative answers to the
underspecified question is construed and what is taken to be the speaker’s motivation
for signaling that the widest answerable construal of the question is being addressed
