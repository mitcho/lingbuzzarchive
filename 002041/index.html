This semantic account has several problems. It fails to provide a uniform semantics for all the noun phrases that appear in an argument position of a verb in the surface syntax. With this analysis, it is harder to compositionally derive the sentential meanings from the lexical semantics. Also, how human reasoning is connected to other abilities, such as perceptual information processing, is less clear in this theory, since the knowledge representations involving quantifiers and other operators have structures quite different from the data-structures that other kinds of information processing (e.g., visual/spatial computation) uses.  Based on such considerations, this paper provides a uniform semantic analysis for both referential and quantificational NPs (QNPs) as arguments of predicates. To provide adequate denotations for QNPs as arguments, we extend Godehard Link's join semi-lattice structures for plural NPs and turn them to complete lattice structures equipped with both join (+) and meet (x).  We also posit positive and negative complete lattices as duals, capturing the fact that entailment relations between propositions are reversed when quantified natural language sentences are negated.  By postulating singular semantic terms and their model theoretic denotations for quantificational NPs, we can remove explicit quantifiers from our first-order semantic representations, running the quantificational inferences only in the background and as required in the interpretation process. This allows us to provide a uniform semantic analysis of natural language NPs and improve the grounding of logical language expressions in their denotational interpretation structures.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002041/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002041<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Manuscript</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>quantifiers; np semantics; first-order logic; algebraic semantics, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>676 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002041">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002041">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
