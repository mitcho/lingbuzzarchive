First, I provide a crosslinguistic typology of the empirical phenomenon of what I call shifting coordinators, i.e. coordinators, which appear linearly inside of their conjuncts (like Latin -que) - a phenomenon that has largely been neglected in both the descriptive as well as in theoretical literature. Based on twelve in-depth case studies, it provides a detailed description of the observed empirical variation of coordinator placement patterns and a discussion of the morphosyntactic, phonological and semantic variables that have an impact on the placement options. 

Second, I show that the variation observed with shifting coordinators closely mirrors the variation that we find with other types of clause-level clitics. In particular, it can be shown that shifting coordinators exhibit the full range of second position effects described in the literature. As will be shown, we find coordinators in second position which are defined in terms of phonological or prosodic phrasing as well as those sensitive to syntactic constituency. Neither of these placement patterns can be reanalyzed as the other or subsumed under the other as they are characterized by different clusters of properties. It can be shown, for example, that phonologically determined second position clitics freely appear inside of syntactic islands whereas morphosyntactically determined second position clitics obey syntactic islands throughout. Against the background, I argue that the properties of shifting coordinators can, at least as a guiding hypothesis, be generalized to other second position effects and inform us about the grammatical behavior of second position elements and other clause-level clitics. This book is the first crosslinguistic work on clitics that keeps the morphosyntactic category of the element under investigation constant and in doing so, it allows us to control for many variables that have an impact on clitic placement. The study at hand thus enables us to test a much wider range of hypotheses than previous studies.  

Third, I provide a formal theoretical model that derives the full variation of shifting coordinators and clitic placement more generally. I will review a number of the most influential attempts in the literature to describe and model the variation in second position placement and point out their respective advantages and disadvantages and I will point out how shifting coordinators can help us identify the most principled and restrictive model. Going from there, I will put forward my own theoretical model called the Distributed Integration account, which has the following properties: It is (a) transformational, (b) cyclic, (c) distributed and (d) subcategorization-based. The approach treats second position effects, as well as clause-level clitic placement more generally, as an interface phenomenon, and that the unusual placement patterns arise as a result of the mapping procedure either from the syntax to the morphology or from the morphology to the phonology, both of which will lead to a distinct cluster of properties. I further show how the approach can be extended to cover clause-level clitics that do not fall under the rubric of second position elements.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008434/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008434<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Habilitation Thesis - Universität Leipzig</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>clitics, coordination, second position, typology, postsyntactic morphology, distributed, morphology, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>166 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008434">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008434">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
