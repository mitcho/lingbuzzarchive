that has been described as having a wide range of functions including (contrastive) topic marking, intensive, emphatic, contrastive, assertive. In Hindi, this function is realized by the enclitic particle =to. Possible English translational equivalents for Hindi =to include discourse markers like in fact, sure, you know, well, as for, at least, finally, but. This paper investigates the diverse uses of =to and argues that the full range can be uniformly accounted for only if =to is taken to be a particle that signals that the question resolved by its prejacent is weak. The analysis treats =to as a generalized downtoner that comments on the strength of the question that the prejacent addresses, relative to the speaker’s information state, prior discourse moves, and assumptions about the common ground.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006473/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006473<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Language</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>discourse particles, formal pragmatics, current question, indo-aryan, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006473/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>640 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006473">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006473">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
