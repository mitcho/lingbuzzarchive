	It is proposed that the structure of Shupamem locative PPs consists of two core components: (a) a functional head, PLoc, and (b) a nominal complement.  Either component may surface without phonetic content once specific requirements are met, namely, once the Edge of the PP is minimally overt.  We claim that the nouns denoting location, unlike referential nouns, depend on PLoc  for their interpretation, as a result of which they may move to its Edge and license a silent P.  A silent P is also licensed by the elements that denote speaker’s point of view, via movement of the silent P to the point of view head; this results in phase extension, and explains the obligatory presence of view markers in some contexts, giving the impression they are Ps.  The account proposed for Shupamem offers a unified treatment of the functional structure of spatial Ps across typologically different languages, while it investigates how silent parts of the spatial P structure are licensed.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001721/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001721<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Accepted in Natural Language and Linguistic Theory</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>shupamem, grassfields bantu, spatial prepositions, point of view markers, phases, edge, light nouns, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>728 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001721">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001721">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
