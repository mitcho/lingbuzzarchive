This distinction largely follows the lexical and post-lexical split-component architecture of Lexical Phonology. It is viewed from a different perspective, though. What is proposed is that the morphophonemic level of language is based on workspaces that are built from autosegmental representations. The building blocks are neither SPE-type feature matrices, nor features used in Sagey&#8217;s (1986) feature geometry. Instead, these are privative features used in Government Phonology, whose phonetic interpretation is cued not only by paradigmatic relations between features defining particular autosegments, but also by syntagmatic relations between features defining adjacent autosegments. In a way, this work pushes Gussmann&#8217;s (2007) treatment of the latter notion to a logical end. The rationale behind postulating this type of phonological analysis is explained in Chapter 1, where emphasis is put on the deficit of explanatory power that earlier theories of phonology had.

Chapter 2 presents the architecture of Workspace Phonology, which is the model that is endorsed in this work. This chapter shows how the new proposal differs from the two theories on which it is based. These are Lexical Phonology (Kiparsky 1982a,b, Booij &#8212; Rubach 1984, 1987, Mohanan 1982, 1986) and CVCV (Scheer 2004 et seq.).

Chapter 3 discusses the morphophonemic and phonological&#8211;phonetic aspects of palatalisation in Polish. The discussion stresses the difference between the morphophonemic side of the process, and the phonological&#8211;phonetic side of the process. The latter is independent of morphophonemic considerations, and it concerns language-specific limitations on the phonetic interpretation of Polish. The chapter includes an excursus on the notions of the Strict Cycle and Derived Environment. Although these issues are important to Lexical Phonology, they almost do not exist in Government Phonology. The excursus shows that both notions are relevant to the theory proposed in this work. The analysis of palatalisation as such provides some explanation as to the cause of the systematic duality of Polish palatalisation. It also dares to speculate which factors allow foreign vocabulary to be used in Polish even if it contains non-native (non-Slavic) word-internal syntagmatic morphophonemic relations. An example at hand is the foreign word sinus &#8220;a sine&#8221;, which contains the sequence [s&#690;i], which not found in any native word of Polish. The sequence in question, however, can freely occur at word boundaries, as in the phrase pies i kot &#8220;a dog and a cat&#8221;. The discussion points to the validity of the split-component approach to phonology.

Chapter 4 discusses voice phenomena in Polish phonology, with emphasis on so-called Poznan&#8211;Cracow Voicing. It is shown that Government Phonology is unable to give a satisfactory answer to the question why this phenomenon is found at word boundaries, but not at word-internal morphological boundaries. It is postulated that the word boundary is a phonological object that can be expressed without recourse to SPE-type [&#8211;segment] segments, which is in the spirit of CVCV. Poznan&#8211;Cracow Voicing is demoted to the interpretive component, in which the word boundary acts as the trigger for the process. The boundary is expressed as a break between linearly-ordered morphophonemic representations. Furthermore, dialectal variation in voice phenomena of word-final obstruents (Warsaw Polish vs. Poznañ&#8211;Cracow Polish) is shown to be a matter of phonetic interpretation, not a matter of morphophonemic representation.

A discussion on voice phenomena and on palatalisation at prefix-root and preposition-host boundaries in Polish, given in Chapter 5, points to yet another diacritic-free representational object in Polish morphophonemics. It is a domain breaker, in the form of an empty onset + nucleus unit, also called an empty CV. This object has been inherited from CVCV. In the present work, it acts as a representational reflex of Class 2 (non-cyclic) morpheme concatenation. The discussion on Polish prefixes and prepositions points to a way of accounting for the two patterns of word-internal palatalisation in Polish representationally. This is against multistratal word formation in Lexical Phonology, where rules are ascribed to apply at some strata, but not on other. The analysis shows that Polish prefixes and preposition need not be dependent on the ordering of affixes that are added to the root. The morphophonemic effect of each affixation can be expressed by means of morphophonemic representations alone.

English affixes, with emphasis on the Class 1 vs. Class 2 distinction, are discussed in Chapter 6. The distribution of the allomorphs of the regular plural is shown to be a matter of phonetic interpretation of one morphophonemic object, rather than an instance of lexical selection. The discussion presents the premises on which this conclusion is drawn. The remainder of the chapter has concentrated on representational distinction between Class 1 and Class 2 affixation, whereby the empty CV is shown to be a viable object for the morphophonemics of English, too. An excursus on the distribution of the sounds [&#331;] and [&#331;&#609;] in English points to the duality of the underlying sequence //&#331;&#609;//. For instance, depending on whether an underlying morpheme-final //&#331;&#609;// is followed by a Class 1 or a Class 2 suffix, it may result in the minimal pair long&#8211;er (the comparative) vs. long&#8211;er (&#8216;he who longs&#8217;). This is somewhat parallel to the duality of palatalisation in Polish, where the pattern of palatalisation at prefix&#8211;root boundaries is not the same as the one at root&#8211;suffix boundaries. For example, a prefixed form of the verb intergrowaæ &#8220;integrate&#8221; is z&#8211;integrowaæ [z&#690;int&#603;&#609;r&#596;va&#680;], but not zintegrowaæ [&#657;int&#603;&#609;r&#596;va&#680;]. Both phenomena have similar representational reflexes.

Finally, Chapter 7 ponders on the distribution of the post-alveolar central approximant sound [&#633;] in English, with emphasis on so-called Intrusive r. The analysis shows representational differences between contexts in which Intrusive r appears with a ranked probability. The ranking order is taken from Cruttenden (2008). The empty CV and the word boundary make an appearance once more, adding to the body of evidence for the model of phonology that this work proposes.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000986/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000986<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ph.D. dissertation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>class 1 affixation, class 2 affixation, cvcv, cyclic affixation, derived environment, empty cv, english, government phonology, interpretation, lexical phonology, locality, modularity, morphophonology, non-cyclic affixation, palatalisation, phonology, polish, poznan-cracow voicing, representation, spe, strict cycle, strict cyclicity, vowel - zero alternations, workspace phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1279 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000986">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000986">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
