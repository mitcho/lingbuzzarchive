This relation is only broken in special circumstances, e.g. when lateral actorship is granted by a systemic parameter. In this paper, I provide a normalisation of lateral actorship by showing that the latter's correlation with complexity also holds for some silent nuclei without introducing a dedicated parameter. The hypothesis is that representational complexity does not necessarily correspond to some phonetic event: a non-empty nucleus can be unpronounced, without this impinging on its lateral actorship. Turbidity Theory provides the formal tools for distinguishing between empty and unpronounced nuclei. This follows from splitting the association between melodic and prosodic units into two independent relations - projection and pronunciation. Empty nuclei lack melodic content, whereas unpronounced nuclei only lack the pronunciation relation. This approach is shown to account for disparate phenomena, such as glide mutation in Classic Arabic, inflectional markers spell-out in Egyptian Colloquial Arabic and the apparently exceptional behaviour of muta cum liquida clusters in Hungarian and in the Italian dialect of Finale Emilia. This approach also allows for a refinement of our understanding of the so-called yers, as well as for constraining the use of floating melody. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006551/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006551<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>The Linguistic Review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>government phonology – strict cv – turbidity theory – silent nuclei – classic arabic – egyptian arabic – final emilia dialect – hungarian, morphology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>498 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006551">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006551">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
