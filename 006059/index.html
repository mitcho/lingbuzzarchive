Cross-cultural and cross-language evidence from different disciplines is important to take into account for a better understanding of the cognitive processes that explain the language awareness factor. Examples from the multilingual Western Hemisphere, from the contact between the American and European languages, are especially relevant because of the time scale of available data (over 2000 years for the first full writing system, successfully deciphered) and the closeness of contact and extensive interaction between the languages (over 500 years). Among the most prominent and thoroughly studied are findings from historical and anthropological research on literacy in the Mayan and Nahuatl languages, the latter from the early Spanish colonial era, the former from the pre-classical period of Mayan civilisation. The findings from this work inform studies of literacy learning among all modern day indigenous language bilingual learners in both Latin America and North America. As an illustration, results from a bilingual (Nahuatl-Spanish) literacy learning project in Puebla state, Mexico, are summarised. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006059/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006059<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Writing Systems Research </td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>metalinguistic awareness, language awareness, writing systems, bilingualism, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>168 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006059">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006059">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
