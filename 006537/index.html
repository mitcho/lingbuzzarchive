The aim of this paper is to investigate the reasons behind the ungrammaticality of the negative sentences with bare plurals in object position in Turkish (eg:*Ben marketten çikolata-lar almadım / I-NOM market-ABL chocolate-lAr buy-NEG-PST-1PRS.SG / Intended Reading: “I did not buy different types of chocolate from the market”) and analyze their internal structures based on the minimalist program (Chomsky, 1993) and the morphosyntactic features in Adger (2003). I claim that there are two reasons behind the ungrammaticality of these types of sentences with bare plurals: syntactic and semantic. The syntactic reason is that Turkish plural -lAr has an existential feature in it which has to be checked by the functional head “Affirmative Phrase”, which I propose in this paper for Turkish, or Determiner Phrase”, in addition its other features such as additive and associative as stated in previous accounts (Lewis 2000, Göksel&Kerslake 2005, Görgülü 2011, Ketrez, 2003). However; in negative sentences with bare plurals, -lAr cannot be checked as there is neither D nor Aff head in the sentence. The semantic reason comes from the scopal relations. As bare plurals do not have any D in them and construct a complex predicate with V-head as stated in Ketrez (2003), and since bare plurals cannot take scope over negation (Kelepir, 2001), this causes an intervention effect between negation and existential operator -lAr in Turkish. This is avoided only when there is a DP which blocks the intervention effect between two operators. However; as the scope of this paper is syntactic features, semantic reason will not be mentioned in that much details in this paper.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006537/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006537<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>İstanbul, Turkey </td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>bare plurals, plurals, affirmative phrase, features, scope, negation, dp, syntax, turkish, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>157 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006537">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006537">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
