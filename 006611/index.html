We define the perceptual similarity between two categories as a typical listener’s degree of belief that one category was intended by a typical talker given that the other was uttered. In low-dimensional "chart-space" we model utterance distributions, conditional on phonemic category, as Gaussian, with means chosen to match the perceptual characteristics of the CNN as closely as possible. In this way, perceptual similarities between high dimensional spectrogram images encoded by the CNN are given a low dimensional representation in the chart. We then present a likelihood-based mapping from acoustic to chart space, via the output of the CNN. This generates low dimensional measurements of individual vowel spectrograms. Our method can in principle be generalized to measure any form of acoustic variation, provided we are able to first define a set of categories of sounds which describe it. The potential value of our approach is that it provides a means of producing perceptually meaningful measurements of sounds directly from their spectrograms. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006611/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006611<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>vowels, measurement, perceptual, machine perception, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>126 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006611">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006611">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
