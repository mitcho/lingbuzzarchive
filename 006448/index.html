This cross-language access, if it can be verified empirically, might be attributed to distinguishing features that differentiate poetic from prosaic discourse, on the one hand, and from musical structure on the other, an important problem in its own right. To approach this research question it is recommended to begin with poetic works as they are performed for a listening audience and to prioritize, at the beginning of the research project, composition and performance from the popular culture, broadly defined, and from the traditional genres of the oral tradition. Another point of reference for this discussion, which follows from the above recommended approach, is the Lerdahl-Jackendoff proposal of analyzing poetry as a kind of musical form.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006448/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006448<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Neohelicon</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>poetics, cross-cultural poetics, bilingualism, hip-hop, tonality, oral tradition, popular culture, russian formalism, language-contact, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>273 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006448">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006448">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
