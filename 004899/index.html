I offer a compositional analysis for this clausal exceptive construction. I propose that an 'except'-clause introduces quantification over possible situations and provides the restriction for this quantification. I show how the analysis developed here derives the inferences 'except' contributes to sentences it occurs in and the restriction on its use. I also show how the approach developed here captures the cases traditional approaches to the semantics of exceptives cannot capture such as cases where an 'except'-phrase contains a PP or multiple syntactic constituents. The approach I propose correctly captures the NPI licensing facts inside 'except'-phrases. In addition, this is the first approach to the semantics of exceptives that correctly captures the contribution of modal phrases such as 'possibly' inside 'except'-phrases.

This is a prefinal draft of the paper that will appear in Natural Language Semantics. The final version that will appear in the journal was revised substantively based on the reviewers’ comments. This document is the same version that was uploaded here earlier with some of the most obvious typos fixed. Specifically, there was a typo in the formulas in (276), (278), (280), where the wrong connector was used.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004899/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004899<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>accepted to Natural Language Semantics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>clausal exceptive constructions, except, clausal exceptives, semantics of exceptives, possibly, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004899/v3.pdf">v3 [July 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004899/v2.pdf">v2 [November 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004899/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>434 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004899">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004899">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
