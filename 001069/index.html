The use of you is constrained, though. It cant refer to the self in assertions about the selfs state of mind, including thoughts, feelings, and intentions. In those cases I is the only option. This is because self-talk-you is 'mindless', thus sharing with ordinary dialogue-you the property of not being controlled by the mind of the speaker. In self-talk there is a speaker (I) and an addressee (you), who can even be represented in the same sentence (I know you can do it!), both pronouns denoting the self. This is possible, without violation of any principles of binding, because in normal self-talk there is ONLY ONE MIND, which can only be addressed as I.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001069/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001069<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Newcastle Working Papers in Linguistics 16, 2010</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>self-talk, speaker, addressee, performative hypothesis, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>460 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001069">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001069">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
