phrases must have at most one specifier and the requirement that adjunction, though

potentially unlimited in number, is restricted to base-generation. This restrictive

understanding of phrase structure dictates, then, that movement (viz. Move qua Copy

plus Merge) cannot adjoin a phrase to some projection XP; it can only be merged to

X and thus form [Spec,XP], and this operation can only take place once per

projection. These restrictions follow once we inspect more closely a suggestion by

Chomsky (1998) on certain structural relations that come for free with the operation

Merge and employ a more accurate consideration of its consequences. I call the

revised relations that define phrase structure Natural Relations. I then spell out what

constitutes appropriate checking configurations and argue that these follow from the

Natural Relations introduced earlier. Though largely conceptually motivated, the

results achieved here conform to fairly traditional objectives of phrase structural

relations, which can be empirically backed up. I also sketch some consequences for a

theory of displacement in general, most importantly the conclusion that this theory

unambiguously prefers an implementation in terms of Move, rather than Attract.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000133/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000133<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>manuscript (University of Cyprus)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>x'-theory, structural relations, adjunction, computation, move, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>328 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000133">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000133">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
