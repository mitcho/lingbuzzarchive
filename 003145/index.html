In the first two experiments, we show that children display a developmental discontinuity in their ability to use a noun's syntactic environment as a cue to its meaning. We argue that this pattern arises from children's reliance on their knowledge of verbs' subcategorization frame frequencies to guide parsing, coupled with an inability to revise incremental parsing decisions. We show that this analysis is consistent with the syntactic distributions in child-directed speech. In the third experiment, we show that the discontinuity arises from predictions based on verbs' subcategorization frame frequencies.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003145/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003145<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cognitive Psychology</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language acquisition, parsing, prediction, thematic role, subcategorization frame, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003145/v2.pdf">v2 [March 2017]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003145/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>717 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003145">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003145">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
