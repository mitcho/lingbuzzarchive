More precisely, pied-piping occurs when a movement operation that usually targets expressions of a particular type (e.g. wh-words) instead targets a phrase that contains an expression of that type. Pied-piping structures have long been a deep and difficult puzzle for formal syntactic theory. This is the second of two articles that present and compare two recent approaches to pied-piping, those of Heck (2008, 2009) and Cable (2010a,b). These works offer two very different perspectives on the nature of pied-piping, and thus yield rather different analyses of specific sub-phenomena. Nevertheless, there is much overlap in their general predictions and in several core assumptions. In this article, I compare the empirical predictions of Heck’s and Cable’s accounts, noting especially those areas where both approaches are challenged. The phenomena we will examine include (i) the locality constraints on pied-piping, (ii) Heck’s ‘Edge Generalization’, (iii) the apparent optionality of some pied-piping structures, and (iv) so-called ‘massive pied-piping’.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001373/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001373<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Invited submission under review by Language and Linguistic Compass</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pied-piping, locality, edge generalization, optional pied-piping, massive pied-piping, ot syntax, q-particles, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>921 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001373">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001373">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
