Price Caldwell</a><br/>October 2006</center>&nbsp;<p></p>Since the 19th Century, students of the science of linguistics (as opposed to grammarians, philologists, natural philosophers, and cultural historians) have wanted to put the discipline onto a solid scientific footing.  To be ‘scientific’ has meant, since the Enlightenment (with its stories of Galileo vs. the Church), to base one’s arguments on close observation of nature rather than the appeal to authority, dogma, or the classics of Greek or Roman literature.  Yet there can be no such thing as pure observation.  It is always conditioned by what constitutes data, what its instruments of observation are, and the problems of assembling particular observations into general ones, so that useful conclusions or deductions – the meaning – can be gleaned from it. 
 In the study of the behavior of signs, as opposed to natural events, empirical methods are especially problematical.  Partly in answer to this complaint, a Structuralist methodology was developed specifically for use in sign systems.  It proved an exciting and productive alternative to empiricism for a short time, and then failed.  My task here is to revisit the history of Structuralism in order to try to understand the cause of the failure, and to consider whether any part of it can be resurrected.  I think it can, and I want to show how.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002637/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002637<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Meisei Review.
