Recent approaches to CD such as Kramer (2014), Harizanov (2014), and Baker and Kramer (2016/2018) have been very successful, but they critically rely on a mechanism to Reduce full DPs to D heads in order to undergo cliticization (and operation which is otherwise unmotivated in the theory). This short squib argues that the need for Reduce is only apparent: we can explain properties of clitic doubling by appealing to some previously-unexplored predictions of Wholesale Late Merger, whereby the content of DP is late-merged into the base position of an object DP only after the object D head has moved and cliticized onto the verb.
