Sometimes, however, they seem to be making an at-issue contribution, in particular, under Contrastive Focus (CF). I explore the projection patterns under CF for standard presupposition triggers and co-speech gestures and conclude that the two pattern closely together. I show that non-projection under CF can be caused locally, when the assertive content of the focused elements of the CF alternatives is not contrastable enough, so CF has to associate with the presuppositional content, for which the latter needs to be accommodated. Non-projection can also be caused globally, when the presupposition of one of the CF alternatives contradicts the presupposition or assertion of some other alternative, which I derive via the alternative assertability principle. I also look at supplements, namely, non-restrictive relative clauses, which interact with CF differently from standard presuppositions and inferences triggered by co-speech gestures. The observed differences are mostly attributable to the configurational properties of the different types of non-at-issue content, so it is unclear to what extent the data investigated in this paper could be used to independently argue for the presuppositional analysis of co-speech gestures and against the supplemental one.
