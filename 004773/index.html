closest to the agreeing element that values the agreement features of that element. More
recently, however, researchers have introduced a new form of agreement that challenges this
generalization, namely highest conjunct agreement in preverbal position, where agreement occurs
with the furthest conjunct. In this squib, I present an apparently similar form of agreement
from Modern Standard Arabic and argue that this form of agreement is not conjunct agreement;
it is rather agreement with a comitative. If this conclusion is on the right track, it calls for further
investigation of furthest conjunct agreement in the other languages, given that, as reported
in the literature, furthest conjunct agreement is less preferred than the other agreement options
and given that it is not attested in the nominal domain although closest conjunct agreement is.
If furthest conjunct agreement turns out to be not real, this provides support for the generalization
that conjunct agreement is strictly a linear phenomenon, lending support to the view
that linear order can be computed in the narrow syntax instead of solely being a part of the
post-syntactic component.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004773/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004773<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>coordination, conjunct agreement, furthest conjunct agreement, comitatives, linear order, modern standard arabic, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>391 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004773">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004773">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
