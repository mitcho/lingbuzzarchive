anywhere else (see also Chomsky 1981/1993, von Stechow 1984), typically contains
two comparative expressions and only one than-clause.
I argue that there is a connection between a cumulative-reading sentence like "at
most 3% of the population own at least 70% of the wealth" (see also Krifka 1999,
Brasoveanu 2013) and the above multi-head comparative. This connection is parallel
to that between a measurement sentence (e.g., Mary is exactly 6 feet tall) and a regular
comparative (e.g., Sue is taller than Mary is): the former means a measurement, while
the latter means comparison between measurements. Thus, semantically, a
multi-head comparative is the comparative form of a multi-measurement sentence,
expressing comparisons along multiple dimensions simultaneously.
Pragmatically, I show that the above multi-head comparative (along with its
corresponding cumulative-reading sentence) addresses a single issue: how skewed
wealth distribution is. Thus in a multi-head comparative, comparisons along multiple
dimensions are not interpreted independently. There is an interplay between changes
along two dimensions, which resolves a single context-dependent issue. I propose
the notion of ‘degree-QUD-based informativeness’ to analyze this interplay.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007777/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007777<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>comparatives, multi-head comparatives, multi-measurement, cumulative reading, degree questions, multi-degree questions, qud, dynamic semantics, maximality, informativeness, comparative correlatives</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007777/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2023]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>569 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007777">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007777">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
