Semantically, I argue that there is a connection between a cumulative-reading sentence (e.g., "3% of the population owned 70% of the land", see also Krifka 1999, Brasoveanu 2013) and a multi-head comparative. This connection is exactly parallel to that between a measurement sentence (e.g., "Mary is 6 feet tall") and a comparative (e.g., "Sue is taller than Mary is"): the former means a measurement, while the latter means comparison between measurements. Therefore, a multi-head comparative is the comparative form of a cumulative-reading sentence, addressing comparisons along multiple dimensions.
I further propose that pragmatically, the interpertation of a multi-head comparative is based on one single underlying degree question-under-discussion (QUD) (e.g., for the above example: how is wealth distribution more skewed in this country than anywhere else?). Thus in a multi-head comparative, comparisons along multiple dimensions are not mutually independent, but address an interplay between increases or decreases along two dimensions, and it is this interplay that resolves the underlying degree QUD. I also discuss comparative correlatives and how multi-head comparatives shed light on the notion of informativeness.
