In this paper, we propose that morphological structures can also be partially activated. Empirical evidence comes from the patterns of Rendaku in Japanese surname compounds. Rendaku is a morphophonological process in which the initial voiceless obstruent of the second member of a compound becomes voiced. Lyman’s Law blocks this process if there is already a voiced obstruent in the second member, but a voiced obstruent in the first member does not block Rendaku; i.e. Lyman’s Law does not apply across a morpheme boundary. However, in surname compounds, the presence of a voiced obstruent in the first member substantially reduces the applicability of Rendaku, unlike in regular compounds. At the descriptive level, surname compounds behave ambiguously between monomorphemic and heteromorphemic words: they undergo the compound voicing process but are also probabilistically subject to the morpheme-internal restriction against multiple voiced obstruents. We demonstrate that this observation can be formally modeled by positing a partially activated morpheme boundary in surname compounds. A quantitative modeling of the data is developed using Gradient Symbolic Representation coupled with Maximum Entropy Harmonic Grammar.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005971/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005971<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of NELS </td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>rendaku, lyman's law, japanese, gradient symbolic representations, morphology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>242 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005971">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005971">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
