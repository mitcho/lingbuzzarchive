Based on two experimental studies, we argue that the head nominal's non-literalness implicated in constructions of this sort is at-issue "the most", while the speaker's attitude to evaluate the head's denotatum negatively is treated as at-issue the least. It is further reasoned that the meaning that the head nominal's denotatum has been called by the quoted name tends to figure as a presupposition, which is compatible with an echo approach towards verbal irony. Our findings support the notion of at-issueness as a graded criterion and can be used to argue that verbal irony in general seems to be difficult to reject directly and, thus, be treated as at-issue.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003622/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003622<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In: Daniel Gutzmann & Katharina Turgay (eds.)
