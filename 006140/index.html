The 
epistemic modals with perfect have are forming a new class including mighta, coulda, woulda, shoulda, 
and musta, when they are used with an additional have. This use is accepted widely. There is a further 
stage where the new modal is selecting an infinitive as its complement, i.e. without a (present) perfect 
meaning, not widely accepted. I describe this set of changes as a cycle because there is both economy and 
renewal at work. The framework used is Minimalist (Chomsky 1995 and onwards), with a more articulated 
TP-layer. The data come from corpus and internet sources; the study is not a quantitative one because the 
(second) change is not yet particularly frequent.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006140/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006140<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Nordlyd</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>affix-hop, features, modal, modal cycle, perfect, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>204 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006140">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006140">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
