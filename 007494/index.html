In particular, we refute the idea that agreement in these constructions may result from a local target DP bearing no substantial φ-features and, as a result, an Agree relation is established with a more distant nominal. We show that there are two derivational patterns to specificational agreement:
agreement with the specificational subject via a probe specified for [_φ] and agreement with the
referential subject via a probe specified for either [_PART] or [_PL] (i.e., specified features of
person and number branches of a feature geometry). Moreover, we argue that resorting to ad hoc
assumptions about the proposal of “probe reduction” need not be employed, as agreement may
be accounted for in both mono- and biclausal constructions without the need to modify the probe.
Consequently, we show that Agree may indeed take place between Tº and the non-referential
subject in monoclausal constructions in languages that consistently show agreement with the
referential subject of specificational clauses (e.g. Persian and Spanish), a pattern deemed
impossible in the system proposed by these authors.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007494/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007494<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>copula, agree, agreement, feature geometry, specificational, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>433 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007494">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007494">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
