it is what drives syntactic derivations. In the beginning of the generative
enterprise, though, agreement was barely taken into account.
In this vignette, I draw a short history of agreement, starting from the
transformational era roughly until Agree (Chomsky 2000, 2001). This overview
has the aim to show the different implementations of the basic intuitions on
agreement over the years, and how Agree has developed to take the form we
know today. It will be evident how different ideas that have been considered
prominent in different periods have converged into the present model, and also
that some concepts never changed.
