I proposed universal conditions on the prosodic consequences of Probe-Goal relations, which are met in different ways in different languages because of independently observable prosodic parameters.  On this account, a given language has obligatorily overt wh-movement, for example, not because of a strong wh-feature in C, but because of universal conditions on the prosody of wh-questions, interacting with language-specific properties of the prosody of the language in question.

I claimed that languages could be distinguished by a binary prosodic parameter; languages were to have either "Left-active" or "Right-active" prosodic systems, tending to realize prosodic prominence at either the left or the right edges of phonological phrases.  In this paper I offer new support for this binary parameter, describing experiments which reliably classify languages as either Left-active or Right-active, and show how the results of these experiments match the predictions of Contiguity Theory.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004785/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004785<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>ms., MIT</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>contiguity theory; overt movement; strong feature; wh-movement; pied-piping; intervention effects, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004785/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1138 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004785">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004785">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
