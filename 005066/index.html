From modern perspectives, these statements can be understood as an assertion about sound symbolism, systematic connections between sounds and meanings. Inspired by these writers, this paper reports on an experiment which tests a sound symbolic value of sibilants. The experiment is a case study situated within the Pokémonastics research paradigm, in which researchers explore the sound symbolic patterns in natural languages using Pokémon names. The current experiment shows that when presented with pairs of a flying type Pokémon character and a normal type Pokémon character, Japanese speakers are more likely to associate the flying type Pokémons with names that contain sibilants than those names that do not contain sibilants. As was pointed out by Socrates, the sound symbolic connection identified in the experiment is likely to be grounded in the articulatory properties of sibilants---the large amount of oral airflow that accompanies the production of sibilants. Various implications of the current experiment for the sound symbolism research are discussed throughout the paper.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005066/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005066<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Open Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonetics, phonology, sound symbolism, pokémon, sibilants, type, flying, socrates, the upanishads, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005066/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>608 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005066">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005066">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
