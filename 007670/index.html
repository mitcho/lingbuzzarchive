Each one of these domains (to the degree that they can in fact be separated) shapes and is shaped by the other in Pirahã. The paper concludes that Pirahã philosophy is in certain ways quite close in spirit to the traditions of Nominalism and Pragmatism in Western philosophy and that recognizing the nominalistic and pragmatic core of Piraha philosophy enables us to explain not only many of the grammatical features discussed in Everett (2005), but also additional components of human language and culture such as the difference between genericity vs. universal quantification, in particular why Pirahã (and arguably all languages) requires generics while universal quantification is either not found in all languages or, more radically, is found in no language as it is traditionally understood (Kornai (2010)).  Pirahã Nominalism, Pragmaticism, and Stoicism emerge naturally from what Everett (2005) calls their "Immediacy of Experience Principle" and culture value system (Everett 2016).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007670/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007670<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>universal quantification, generics, nominalism, pragmatism, culture, &quot;immediacy of experience&quot;, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007670/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2023]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>183 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007670">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007670">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
