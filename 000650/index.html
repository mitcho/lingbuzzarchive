  Domain (CED; Huang:82) can be derived from the Phase

  Impenetrability Condition (PIC; Chomsky:01, Chomsky:05) if the following 

assumptions are made: (i) All syntactic operations are driven by

features of lexical items. (ii) These features are ordered on lexical

items. (iii) All phrases are phases. (iv) Edge features that trigger

intermediate movement steps can only be added before  the phase

head becomes inert.  Given (i-iv), it follows from the

PIC that extraction from XP is blocked if the operation that has

merged XP is the final operation taking place in a phase: A

last-merged specifier is a barrier because no edge feature can be

inserted that might extract some item out of it; this induces a PIC

violation on the following cycle. The analysis can be extended to

cover freezing effects. Furthermore, it predicts the

existence of a phenomenon that I call melting effect. I show

that melting effects occur in German and Czech: Local scrambling in front of

what would otherwise qualify as a last-merged specifier renders the

specifier transparent for extraction. 



The single most important assumption of the present

proposal is that the timing of edge feature insertion is crucial

(`before' vs. `after' in (iv)). Accordingly, the

analysis can be viewed as an argument in support of a strictly

derivational organization of grammar.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000650/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000650<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms. Universitaet Leipzig</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ced, pic, strict cycle, phase, edge feature, scrambling, freezing, melting, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>753 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000650">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000650">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
