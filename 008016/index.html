which, nevertheless, has anticausative semantics. Verbs forming such 'transitive anticausatives'
(e.g., The water raised its temperature.) also form canonical anticausatives (cf. The temperature
of the water rose.). Such verbs differ from verbs that only form canonical anticausatives (cf.
The water warmed.) in that they do not lexicalize a fixed scale along which they measure change
so that the DP merged in the internal argument position of these verbs (a DP denoting a property
concept like the temperature) can determine the actual scale of change. When these verbs form
canonical anticausatives, the entity undergoing change along this scale is realized as the
possessor of this internal argument DP. When these verbs form transitive anticausatives, the
entity undergoing the change is realized in the verb’s canonical external argument position,
where it is, however, not assigned any external argument role. Instead, as in the canonical
anticausative variant, it is interpreted as the possessor of the internal argument DP. This
possessive relation is overtly reflected in English and other languages where the subject of the
transitive anticausative construal binds a possessive pronoun in the internal argument DP.
After an illustration of the phenomenon in typologically different languages, the article
lays out the above semantic properties of the transitive anticausative construal and the verbs
occurring in it. It then subsumes transitive anticausatives under the theory of the causative
alternation in Alexiadou et al. (2006, 2015), Schäfer (2008). Particular attention is, thereby,
given to the morphological marking that sets apart, in many languages, the lexical causative
and the anticausative variant of (a subset of) alternating verbs (cf. English raise/rise). Transitive
anticausatives show a theoretically challenging but informative behavior here. Even though the
transitive anticausative construal expresses anticausative semantics, its verb necessarily
features the morphological marking that is canonically associated with its lexical causative use.
This suggests that the morphological difference often found between pairs of lexical causative
and anticausative verbs is only indirectly related to causative and anticausative semantics, but
it is ultimately determined by more abstract, syntactic properties.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008016/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008016<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear: NLLT</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>causative alternation, verbs of change, lexical decomposition, syntax-semantics interface, transitivity, anticausative morphology, causative morphology, syntax-morphology interface, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/008016/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2024]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>289 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008016">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008016">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
