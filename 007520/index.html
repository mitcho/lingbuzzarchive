In mass nouns, plurals, and events we find "viel" (often translated as much), like in English. In states we find "sehr" (often translated as very).


I argue that this is due to selectional criteria. The operator "viel" selects measurements that monotonically map between the part-whole ordering of the thing that is being measured and the degree that the measurement represents. For example, we can measure salt in terms of weight. As the weight increases, so does the amount of salt. However, when we measure salt in terms of color, this has no effect on the amount of salt present, see Schwarzschild (2006). The operator "sehr", selects measurements which do not map between a part-whole ordering and degrees.

I contextualize these findings within a current debate in semantics on the status of degree modification and the nature of states. I assume with Wellwood (2015) that measure functions are introduced compositionally by an external operator ("viel" and "sehr" in German). However, I also argue that German supports Baglini (2015)’s claim that states are not ordered in part-whole relationships, but are ordered in equivalence classes instead, which provide different measurements than events. The German distribution can be derived, once we assume that "sehr" selects for the kinds of measurements we find in states and "viel" selects for measurements that monotonically map to a part-whole ordering.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007520/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007520<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Dissertation submitted to University of Arizona linguistic department</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>degree semantics, degree modification, much, monotonicity, states, part-whole relation, comparatives, excessives, measure functions, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007520/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2023]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>252 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007520">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007520">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
