Our focus is on the syntax-semantics interface, since we will attempt to provide a model for interpretation of clitics and their associate constituents. We will address the problem of so-called “clitic doubling”, to see the semantic consequences that different syntactic configurations have, and investigate on how syntactic operations are triggered by the need to generate interface effects. We will put forth the thesis that clitics are procedural elements whose function is to license the presence of their associates and provide the semantic interface with instructions as to how to manipulate those sortal associates. Our argumentation will take elements from formal syntax (Radical Minimalism) and semantics-pragmatics (Relevance Theory) to configure an interface-based approach in which no phenomenon is studied in substantive isolation, but taking into account the interaction between different components of the system. Our aim is to provide prospects for a unified theory of the syntax-semantics of clitics, drawing on data from Spanish to support our theoretical claims.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001614/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001614<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>ReVEL, 12.
