It falls into three parts: the first attempts to illustrate Vincent’s account of the changes of Latin complement patterns with concrete examples from Old Spanish and Old Italian (Vincent (1988:66-69)); the second deals with the origins of two Romance prepositional infinitives (namely de + infinitive and ad + infinitive) that have stood out in the survey of the changes of complement patterns and attempts to give a Minimalist interpretation of the grammaticalisation process that has to led to the specialised usages of these two infinitives; and the third narrates the evolution of these two prepositional infinitives from Old Spanish and Old Italian to their modern state. The first part of the dissertation will show that in the evolution from Latin to Romance quod-clause has generalised as the default finite complementiser, while de + infinitive and ad + infinitive developed along with it. The former appears in more contexts while the latter only in contexts that imply futurity. The second part begins with a recapitulation of the interpretation of grammaticalisation within the Minimalist framework (Roberts and Roussou (2003)) and will show that  the grammaticalisation that leads to the formation of complementisers (C-elements) is especially interesting for it is not entirely consistent with the Minimalist analysis of grammaticalisation. The grammaticalisation of Latin de and ad will be shown to be similar yet different from Roberts and Roussou’s (2003) case studies of the grammaticalisation of C-elements and is hence interesting. The final part of the dissertation will show that Spanish and Italian undergo different evolutions in their treatment of de + infinitive and ad + infinitive and so, in terms of the syntactic development of prepositional infinitives, Spanish and Italian do not show dialectal affinity. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004126/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004126<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Graduate Student Centre, Samuel Alexander Building, University of Manchester</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>latin, romance, philology, preposition, infinitive, prepositional complementiser, prepositional infinitive, grammaticalization, minimalism, complementation, clausal complementation, non-finite complementation, syntax, syntax, keith tse</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>87 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004126">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004126">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
