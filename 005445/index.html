Various patterns of data are analyzed using tools from formal syntactic theory. The bracketed sequences in (1) are argued to represent nexuses.

(1)  a.  Captain Haddock considers [Thompson to be a spy].
      b.   Mr. Wagg wants [Professor Calculus to show him his invention].
      c.   Tintin considers [Thomson a spy].
      d.  Madame Castafiore wants [Nestor fired].

Differences between examples like (1a) and (1b) have been discussed extensively in the generative literature (e.g. Bresnan 1972); less so examples like (1c-d), which exhibit some of the same contrasts but also some different ones. For example, Pollard & Sag 1993 observe that the bracketed sequence in (1d), but not the one in (1c), can appear in a pseudocleft, as in (2a-b).

(2) a. *What Tintin really considers is [Thomson a spy].
     b.  What Madame Castafiore really wants is [Nestor fired].

In Chapter 1, I argue that the relation between the subject and the predicate in a nexus is mediated by a phonologically null head (called ‘Pred’ for predicator). I also discuss the relation of c-selection (Pesetsky’s 1982 term for Chomsky’s 1965 ‘strict subcategorization’) and develop a system of head-chains (building on Sigurðsson 1990), which allow features and feature-values to be shared among heads. Finally, I propose a formal notion of dependency. Put briefly, a phrase X is dependent on a head Y if the mapping rules which translate LF (Logical Form) trees into logical representations cannot assign a value to X unless a head-chain is formed between Y and X.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005445/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005445<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD dissertation, University of California at Santa Cruz</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>predication, small clause, secondary predicate, verb-particle, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>328 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005445">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005445">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
