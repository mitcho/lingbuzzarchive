It is the ritual language of a women’s spiritual group known popularly as Okule or more correctly as Oko Alija. The spiritual system is practiced among women in several communities in Guang and Ghana-Togo Mountain areas of the Ghana-Togo border area, including in several Nawuri-speaking villages as well as farther east in Adele and Achode. It is presumably practiced in Togo as well but we have no information on that. As we will show, the language and the spiritual practices it is connected with are clearly of Yorùbá origin, and therefore most likely arrived in the area from the Ifẹ̀ (Togo) Yorùbá speaking communities. Kiliji is argued to be the westernmost recorded instantiation in Africa of a Yorùbá variety used in performing rituals related to the deity Chankpana.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005780/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005780<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of West African Languages</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>kiliji, yoruba, ghana, spiritual language, semantics, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>271 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005780">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005780">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
