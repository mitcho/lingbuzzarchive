Natural language approximates causation by representing culmination of events and what we call a CCF subject. Both of these building blocks of lexical semantics are also found in non-causative verb classes. It should not come as a surprise that the linguistic expression of causation underdetermines the mental model to which it corresponds: that is the normal state of affairs for any linguistic representation.

	It is of course impossible to prove a negative and therefore we cannot provide conclusive evidence for the absence of causing events in linguistic structures. However, we show that phenomena that might be construed as providing support for a full representation of causation in fact do no such thing. Most prominent among these is the apparent restriction to direct causation in simple causatives. We argue that such a restriction faces a number of counterexamples and that observations supporting it can be reinterpreted in different terms.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001137/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001137<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>(Revised version) To appear in M.
