Building on findings from Wiegand et al. (2013) and Vartiainen (2013), this paper argues that subjective adjectives such as cute tend to be placed in predicative position not just because they often describe discourse-new information, but because this position serves to foreground information that the hearer may disagree with. This claim is supported using data from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (Davies 2008-) combined with human annotations for subjectivity from Scontras et al. (2017) et seq.; and data
from image captions versus descriptions (for seeing versus low-vision people) from the National Gallery of Art. A production experiment manipulates the discourse context to further show that adjectives tend to be placed in predicative position when they express controversial information. Overall, this paper explores how the lexical semantics of adjectives shapes the pragmatic contexts in which they tend to be used, which in turn shapes the syntax of the sentences using them.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008354/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008354<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>attributive, predicative, adjectives, subjectivity, epistemic authority, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>182 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008354">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008354">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
