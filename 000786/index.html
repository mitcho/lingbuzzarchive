Following Sportiche (1988), Hornstein assumes that FQs are residues of an A-movement. He observes that examples in which an NP is associated to more than one FQ are odd. On the contrary, structures involving two A-chains, each containing a FQ, are fully legitimate. If OC can be analyzed in terms of movement, OC structures containing more than one FQ are expected to be ungrammatical. Hornsteins diagnostics can be straightforwardly extended to Italian. However, OC sentences do not seem to be intuitively as degraded as root sentences and raising sentences. Wurmbrand (2001) and Cinque (2004, 2006) propose that NP movement is involved in restructuring. On the other hand, in non-restructuring infinitives the infinitival subject is PRO. The prediction is then that restructuring structures should be strongly marginal, when tested through Hornsteins diagnostics, whereas non-restructuring structures should be acceptable. The question then arises whether Hornsteins diagnostics really show that OC involves movement, or whether they show that a given structure involves restructuring rather than OC. Building on data from Italian, it will be shown that the second option seems to be the correct one and how this conclusion is relevant within the debate whether even PC can be reduced to movement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000786/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000786<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>control, restructuring, floating quantifiers, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000786/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2008]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1067 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000786">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000786">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
