female Qatari students2 majoring in English at the University of Qatar. It is a cross- sectional

study since it examines a cross-section of learners at different levels of learning (ranging from the

low intermediate to advanced level).

Four attitudional variables/types (general, expectations, instrumental and integrative) were

singled out for detailed investigation. The study attempts to find answers to the following

questions:

a) Is there a correlation between attitudional factors and achievement in English subjects?

b) Is there a correlation between attitudional factors and years spent in learning English?

c) Is there a correlation between attitudional factors, achievement in English and years of
