A novel typological generalization about plural pattern languages is established: they either have affixal definite articles or lack definite articles. In light of this, a new analysis of APs in plural pattern languages is proposed whereby this pattern is derived via movement of the Number head. It is shown that a movement-based approach to the plural pattern both deduces the novel typological generalization and solves a long-standing puzzle regarding a restriction against plural possessor agreement with APs in plural pattern languages. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006815/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006815<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in U.
