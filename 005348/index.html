What is commonly called “illocutionary force” is differentiated into three structurally and functionally distinct layers: a judgement phrase, representing subjective epistemic and evidential attitudes; a commitment phrase, representing the social com-mitment related to assertions; and an act phrase, representing the relation to the common ground of the conversation. The article provides several pieces of evidence for this structure: from the interpretation and syntactic position of various classes of epistemic, evidential, affirmative and speech act-related operators, from clausal complements em-bedded by different types of predicates, from embedded root clauses, and from anapho-ra referring to different clausal projections. The syntactic assumptions are phrased with-in X-bar theory, and the semantic interpretation makes use of dynamic update of com-mon ground, differentiating between informative and performative updates. The object language is German, with particular reference to verb final and verb second structure.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005348/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005348<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Berlin</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>assertions, speech acts, commitments, common ground, german, epistemics, evidentiality, modality, adverbials, complement clauses, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005348/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1217 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005348">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005348">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
