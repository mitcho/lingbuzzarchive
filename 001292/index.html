The interest of exploring the SF construction is related to the fact that, in Modern Icelandic and Faroese, it is in complementary distribution with overt preverbal subjects, and its function is not clear, despite the consistent amount of literature discussing it. Given the unsatisfactory results of synchronic analyses of SF, a comparison with the Old Italian system, chosen as indicative of the Old Romance parameter setting, was carried out. The comparison is motivated by the proven analogies between Old Romance and Old Germanic languages, which, in many respects, display similar syntactic systems. Since the changes in the parameter setting from Old to Modern Icelandic are relatively recent and scarce (i.e. the Modern Icelandic system is quite conservative), there is reason to believe that Old Italian and Modern Icelandic are more similar than one could guess at a first glance. In consideration of these facts, the diachronic integration of the present comparative study is motivated and supported by evidence of UG principles in the systems under investigation. The explored parametric differences are understood as different syntactic strategies to meet the interface requirements imposed by the conceptual-intentional system. The core of the proposal is that SF is one such strategy enabling subject drop or extraction via a feature checking-mechanism imposed by the information structure.
