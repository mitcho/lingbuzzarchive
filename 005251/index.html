In answer to this question, this paper reports on our ongoing multi-lingual initiative, “COVID-19 Myth Busters in World Languages,” in which we translate the list of myth busters related to COVID-19 issued by WHO into as many languages as possible, including a number of minority languages. As of November 2020, our list includes up to 109 languages. This initiative has the potential to lessen the further spread of the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to function as a preventive measure for a future pandemic by sharing basic information about public health. From the most general perspective, we situate the current project as a case in which we can make use of our expertise for the welfare of society, having broad impacts that go beyond the linguistics community.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005251/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005251<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in REPORTS of the Keio Institute of Cultural and Linguistic Studies 52, (2021)]</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>broader impacts, covid-19, public health, minority languages, collaborative initiative, semantics, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005251/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>595 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005251">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005251">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
