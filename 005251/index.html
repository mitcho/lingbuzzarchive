In answer to this question, this short paper reports on our ongoing multi-lingual initiative, "COVID-19 Myth Busters in World Language," in which we translate the list of myth busters related to COVID-19 issued by WHO into as many languages as possible, including a number of minority languages. This initiative has the potential to lessen the further spread of the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to function as a preventive measure for a future pandemic. While translation may not be a core task of linguistic research, we submit that this initiative provides an opportunity for linguists to "pay back" many language communities, who have been providing valuable data for decades for the development of linguistic theory.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005251/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005251<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>broader impacts, covid-19, public health, minority languages, collaborative initiative, semantics, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>177 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005251">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005251">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
