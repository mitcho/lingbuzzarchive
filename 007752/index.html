This harmony process is traditionally referred to as metaphony. Southern Salentino metaphony is characterized by microvariation. We investigated the Southern Salentino variety spoken in Tricase, focusing our analysis both on the inter-speaker and intra-speaker variation. Our first objective is to explain the acoustic and articulatory nature of the metaphonic patterns and to establish what features are involved in the assimilatory process. Acoustically, we show that the metaphonic variant [e] has lower F1 and higher F2 values than /ɛ/, while the metaphonic variant [o] has lower F1 and lower F2 values than /ɔ/. We also demonstrate that the articulatory feature [±ATR] is significantly correlated with the metaphonic contrasts. Our second objective is to develop an appropriate phonological analysis of the phenomenon and describe the interacting parameters that may generate the microvariation, we suggest that an important factor in the variation is the presence of a constraint against [+back, +ATR] vowels preventing high [+back, +ATR] triggers and/or mid [+back, +ATR] outcomes. We also suggest that, although phonologized, the metaphonic process has not yet become normative in the language of the community thus leading to inter-speaker and intra-speaker variation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007752/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007752<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>metaphony, harmony, microvariation, phonologization, acoustic-articulatory analysis, phonological analysis, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>344 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007752">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007752">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
