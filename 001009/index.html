I define the biolinguistic point of view as the scientific study of languages (an abstract biology of languages) and I show that from this point of view, languages are human language organs, that is, they are natural objects. However, languages change over time; therefore, they are also historically modified natural objects. Considering that natural organisms are also historically modified natural objects, I look for inspiration in evolutionary theory to better specify what kinds of objects languages are and how they change and diversify themselves. I consider some alternatives to this conception, especially those functional and cognitive approaches that view languages as cultural objects and I present a

comparison between the two points of view with regard to the extent of linguistic diversity. I conclude that every language is a unique evolutionary history. This conclusion means that although the structure of languages reveals aspects of formal elegance (as the minimalist inquiry has shown) and aspects of functional efficiency (as shown by the obvious fact that they are usable for thought and communication), there are no arguments to state that

these aspects are manifested more or less intensely in some languages than in others. Then their formal and functional aspects are part of what is common to all languages, while variable parts of language are a reflection of the essentially historical nature of our language organs.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001009/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001009<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001009">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001009</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Open Linguistics, 1: 71-95 (2014)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>biolinguistics, parameter, language change, typology, linguistic diversity, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001009/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2010]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2089 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001009">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001009">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
