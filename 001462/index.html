In recent years, the Rich Agreement Hypothesis received a lot of bad press, both on empirical and theoretical grounds. In this article, we demonstrate that all the empirical arguments against this hypothesis are seriously flawed and that it therefore must be rehabilitated in its strongest form. Moreover, we argue that the correlation between syntax and morphology is not direct (morphology does not drive syntax) but results from acquisition: only if language learners are confronted with particular morphological contrasts do they postulate the presence of corresponding formal features that in turn drive syntactic operations. More concretely, we demonstrate that only if language learners can infer that argumenthood is grammaticalized in their target language are they able to postulate a particular functional projection in the extended vP to which the finite verb must move. Finally, we show that this explanation of the Rich Agreement Hypothesis makes correct predictions with respect to language variation, change and acquisition.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001462/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001462<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>manuscript</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>v-to-i movement, (rich) agreement, syntax-morphology relation, argumenthood, learnability, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001462/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2012]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2050 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001462">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001462">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
