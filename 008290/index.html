type of second-position phenomena is Lithuanian reflexive si (Nevis and Joseph
1993, Embick and Noyer 2001, Embick 2007). Based on the data in consultation with native speakers and building on previous studies (Arkadiev 2012,
Korostenskien ̇e 2017, Author 2017, 2018), I provide empirical arguments against
treating si as a second-position element and establish a new empirical generalization that raises important considerations for theories of movement. I show that (i) si appears as an outermost suffix at the end of the host if
there is no verbal prefix or (ii) if one or multiple verbal prefixes are present,
si appears as a prefix immediately preceding the smallest verbal stem ie., the
smallest verbal unit to which the verbal prefix can attach. I show that (ii)
applies at all times (with two lexical exceptions which were the basis for the
older generalization), regardless of how many verbal prefixes are present. My generalization makes correct predictions for the placement of si across verbal
and nominal domains: verbs with multiple verbal prefixes, verbs derived from
nouns with nominal prefixes, and complex nominalizations, which have not been
fully taken into consideration previously. The new generalization cannot be fully
accounted for by LD and requires a new analysis, questioning the need for and
validity of post-syntactic movement. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008290/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008290<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>local dislocation, reflexive -si-, lexical and superlexical prefixes, movement, second position, distributed morphology, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>118 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008290">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008290">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
