In this paper, I discuss Tamil AA which involves a nominalizing N and A’-to-A’- movement. Based on this and other data, I then argue that an adequate AA theory needs to be able to make reference to specific phi-probing heads. I evaluate current theories of AA paying special attention to Baier (2017b, 2017c)’s morphological account of AA. I propose that this theory requires morphology to have information that the syntactic component does not have even in a feature-sharing approach to AGREE (Frampton & Gutmann 2000). As such I argue that AA is decided in the syntax and occurs when a head fails to copy any of the features of a potential goal including any phi-features that may be needed for valuation. I formalize this account in OT, following Erlewine (2016) and show how it can be extended to account for what Baier (2017c) calls partial AA.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003681/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003681<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>cleft, anti-agreement, agreement, syntax, a-bar movement, tamil, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003681/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2017]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>700 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003681">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003681">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
