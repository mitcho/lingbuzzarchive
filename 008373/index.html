In one the classifier forms a constituent with the numeral; in the other it forms a constituent with the noun. These two structures lead to different expectations with respect to ellipsis if what can delete must be a constituent (as in a movement approach to deletion â€“ Cinque 2022 https://nyu.zoom.us/rec/share/cP6j75NoGCl2XCdENoVxcQeAaq95LKaDTHfgwvIGqiH8v9MQKod7hXG7RurK_OnT.11s8MhvtFTObkyXM). The first leads one to expect that the classifier cannot be deleted together with the noun as they do not form a constituent to the exclusion of the numeral. The second leads to the opposite expectation as the classifier and the noun do form a constituent to the exclusion of the numeral, so that deletion can target CLF and N. Both expectations appear to be borne out in different languages. Under ellipsis of the noun the classifier cannot be deleted in Japanese, Korean, among other languages, but can in Vietnamese and Thai, among other languages, thus suggesting that both structures are available: the first for Japanese and Korean and the second for Vietnamese and Thai. In addition to the differential properties just mentioned the two types also differ in a number of other properties.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008373/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008373<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Quaderni di lavoro ASIt n. 24 (2022) (Festschrift in honour of Cecilia Poletto's 60th birthday, Volume 1) 75-87 ISSN: 1828-2326 http://asit.maldura.unipd.it/papers.html</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sortal classifiers for numerals, for nouns and their co-occurrence, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>248 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008373">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008373">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
