The theory that I describe in this document has achieved, using only simple and well-motivated mechanisms of Linearization-based HPSG and Minimal Recursion Semantics, a reasonably comprehensive descriptive adequacy in regard to phenomena such as right-node raising, left-node raising, and split-antecedent relative clauses, none of which has received satisfactory treatment in other theories of grammar. Much of the content of this document is recapitulation of material that has already appeared in the literature, but I make a new theoretical proposal about how coordination of scopal predicates, including coordination of quantifiers, might be handled in Minimal Recursion Semantics.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008392/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008392<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>coordination, right-node raising, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>263 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008392">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008392">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
