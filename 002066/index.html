Numeral phrases in Polish and Russian, as in other West and East Slavic languages, exhibit puzzling behavior. In particular, to judge by the morphosyntax of the constituents of the numeral phrase, the internal structure of the phrase appears to depend upon the external context of that phrase. The problem is a well-known paradox of Slavic syntax, and a considerable literature has been devoted to it. The purpose of this paper, which complements other work by Babby (1987), Franks (1995), Kosta (2008), Rappaport (2002), (2003) and Rutkowski (2006), is to develop a Minimalist theory of formal features, case syncretism, and lexical representation which effectively removes the paradox by maintaining (despite appearances) the usual independence of internal phrase structure and external context, while placing the morphosyntactic variation where such anomalous facts belong: in the lexicon and to the interfaces.
In the first part, I shall try to give a short overview of the puzzle concerning all the problems of case, number assignment and agreement in numeral and numerative constructions in Russian and Polish. In the second part, I shall try to give the solution to some problems so far unresolved, namely in which connection Agreement and Case assignment are driven by interface conditions of either PF (SM) or LF (CI) in the new approach of Strong Minimalist Thesis (Chomsky 2005). The patterns of Case assignment will be analyzed under the notion Agree and Feature checking within the descriptive generalization of so called heterogeneous vs. homogeneous paradigm. This section tries to refine the analysis of “heterogeneous” vs. “homogenous” morphosyntax of numeral expressions making use of recent syntactic developments, namely the emergence of the case-assigning mechanism Agree. The key insight is taken from Gilbert Rappaport’s approach on case assignment (2002), refined and enriched by the mechanism of interpretability and valuation of features from the recent studies on the Syntax of Valuation and the interpretability of Features developed by David Pesetsky and Esther Torrego (2004).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002066/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002066<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax nump  agree valuation quantification, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002066/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2736 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002066">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002066">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
