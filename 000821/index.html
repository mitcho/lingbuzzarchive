For Bavarian, this analysis dates back to Bayer (1984), who starts his discussion with the hypothesis that the morphemes in C are clitics. By means of phonological and syntactic criteria he shows that they are in fact verbal agreement. However, new data from the Middle Bavarian variant of Gmunden, Austria, cast doubt on this analysis. In this thesis I present new systematically collected data from this dialect. Applying a number of well-known criteria for the distinction between clitics and inflection, I show that at least in the variant under discussion these morphemes cannot be verbal agreement morphology in the narrow sense and hence cannot be dealt with in terms of syntactic agreement between C and the subject. Furthermore, these data also shed new light on the distinction between clitics and inflection. I argue that these morphemes are base-generated together with the subject and move to C during the derivation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000821/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000821<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000821">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000821</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Master's thesis, University of Vienna</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>microvariation, bavarian, complementiser, clitics, inflection, agreement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>443 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000821">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000821">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
