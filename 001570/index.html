On the one hand, it proposes to reconsider
Romanian resultative constructions by examining lexicalized (idiomatic)
expressions of the type a bate mar ‘beat flat//beat as soft/red as an
apple’ or a freca luna/oglinda ‘scrub clean/shiny//scrub as clean/shiny as the
moon/mirror’ which have not been the object of intense research and which
have largely been ignored from several discussions on Romanian resultatives.
The focus is on semantic, aspectual, syntactic and l-syntactic pieces
of evidence which are all meant to show that these and similar structures
are resultative constructions. On the other hand, without diminishing or
abolishing the systematic difference that exists between Germanic and Romance
languages from the perspective of these predicate constructions, the
paper emphasizes the importance of language-specific considerations and
it stresses the fact that syntactic and cross-linguistic conclusions should not
be drawn on the basis of Romance or other language families more generally,
but they need to be related to the analysis of resultatives in a specific
language/in specific languages. In this sense, the paper sheds light on some
interesting differences among these predicate structures in Romance.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001570/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001570<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ianua.
