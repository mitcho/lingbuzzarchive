Lexical gender is a salient meaning component of a noun; this dimension of gender is syntactically inert. Semantic gender is a category of thought, basic to human cognition, and conveyed by pronominal resources. Examples of semantic genders are masculine, feminine, countable, non-countable, animate, and non-animate. Formal gender is – synchronically – phonology and thus syntactically inert. This means that there is no Formal Gender Phrase or the like in the syntactic tree. The three dimensions are clearly separate, but they interact, and the pronominal forms associated with the different dimensions are sometimes identical, which blurs the picture.
The formal gender features have basically the same status as the phonological features of a root. Thus, formal gender does not carry any inherent meaning, but may be used for the spell-out of semantic distinctions, for example animate – inanimate. Of particular importance is the idea that neuter is used in Mainland Scandinavian to spell out the absence of number, which accounts for neuter agreement on so-called pancake sentences. A pragmatic effect is that neuter in such contexts corresponds to non-countability. In adjectival agreement, however, formal gender is more or less ornamental. Agreement on adjectives is a phonological wellformedness criterion, and if no other source to agreement is available, agreement will be in formal gender.
Drawing on work done in the 80s (primarily Bosch 1983; 1986; Cornish 1983), I argue that it is necessary to distinguish between pronouns that refer to a linguistic entity, for example a DP, and pronouns that refer to a discourse entity. This is, in fact, what lies behind they properties of hybrid nouns (Corbett 1991), which are cases where the two ways of making reference make use of different pronominal forms. For Swedish the pronouns den (3C) and det (3N) are carefully discussed in this study. It is shown that these pronouns can be used as Syn-pronouns, that is for reference to noun phrases, where the head nouns are formally common gender or neuter, but also as Ref-pronoun, to make reference to countable or non-countable discourse entities.
The analyses are based on Mainland Scandinavian, but an outlook is made to some related languages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002801/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002801<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>gender, formal gender, semantic gender, lexical gender, neuter, countable, non-countable, mainland scandinavian, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>175 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002801">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002801">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
