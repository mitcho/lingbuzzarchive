Especially in the latter case, it is tempting to analyze such cases as instances of sluicing, on a par with interrogative/question examples like "He's talented, but I don't know how talented". I show, however, that reduced unconditionals (at least in English) do not result from sluicing. Rather, following Culicover 1999, I argue that 'partially' reduced unconditionals involve a small clause consisting only of the subject and wh-marked predicate. 'Fully' reduced unconditionals do not result from ellipsis, but rather make use of a null pronoun in the subject position of the small clause, a pronoun which I argue shows the properties of little 'pro'. Reduced unconditionals in English therefore appear to be genuine cases of pseudosluicing (Merchant 1998). I also formulate a previously unremarked-upon descriptive generalization concerning reduced unconditionals: one of the clauses in a reduced unconditional construction must contain a (possibly covert) E-type pronoun, bound from the other clause.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003624/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003624<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ellipsis, unconditionals, pseudosluicing, sluicing, pro-drop, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>230 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003624">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003624">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
