This representational difference is integrated into an explanation of why glides may be skipped in vowel harmony, even when other consonants do participate in harmony. In addition, we propose that the glides [j,w] have two Designated Articulators: [j] is both [Dorsal] and [Coronal], and [w] is both [Dorsal] and [Labial]. These representational proposals shed light on a number of phenomena, such as why the glide [j] becomes [k] in some languages, but [Z] in others, as well as why the glide [w] can sometimes become [m]. In short, glides are mentally represented as neither vowels nor consonants, have their own constriction degree, and have two Designated Articulators. The interaction of the logic of abstract binary featural representations together with representational notions such as contrastivity and representational simplification yields this typology of variable patterning.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000535/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000535<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in a Special Issue of Lingua on Glides</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonological representations, glides, designated articulators, russian, turkish, cypriot greek, bergüner romansh, fula, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3138 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000535">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000535">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
