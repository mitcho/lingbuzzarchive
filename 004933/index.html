However, in order to use eye-tracking to this end, experimental syntacticians must have clear hypotheses about how to link grammatical constructs to reading behavior. This requires linking hypotheses between parsing operations and grammatical constructs, and between reading behavior and parsing operations. The ability to articulate these linking hypotheses presupposes a basic understanding of the reading task and how aspects of the task are reflected in eye-tracking measures.
To this end, we provide a rudimentary overview of the psychology of reading and the basics of the eye-tracking-while-reading method. We review a few findings that motivate the assumption that effects of grammatical processing – or at least parsing operations – are reflected in the eye- tracking record. We offer remarks on practical aspects of constructing an eye-tracking experiment, and interpreting its results. Our remarks include cautionary guidelines regarding statistical pitfalls and the tendency to assume too direct a mapping from specific dependent measures to exact parsing operations.
We also discuss issues that face anyone who wishes to align a grammatical model with a parsing model. Parsing behavior (and eye-tracking results) can only be relevant for grammatical theorizing if one assumes some degree of transparency between grammatical constructs and parsing operations. That transparency requires that the analyst explicitly commit to a particular parsing model (or an equivalence class of parsing models) that provides a restrictive inventory of parsing operations to which grammatical constructs can be set into correspondence. This task is complicated by the observation that different parsing models furnish different sets of primitive operations and functions. This entails that predictions about where an analyst might expect to find effects, or what effects constitutes evidence for or against a particular grammatical construct often vary as a function of the specific parsing model assumed.
We offer in-depth case-studies on the processing of A’-dependencies and reflexive anaphors, and discuss how their results reflect on grammatical questions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004933/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004933<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Oxford Handbook of Experimental Syntax</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>eye-tracking, linguistic theory, sentence processing, psycholinguistics, syntax, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>259 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004933">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004933">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
