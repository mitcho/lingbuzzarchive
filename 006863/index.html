Co-occurrence of these two alternations is surprising under the traditional view of Austronesian literature, where Philippine-type voice is considered valency- indicating morphology located in Voice and predicted to be incompatible with Indo-European–type voice (Payne 1982; Mithun 1994; Aldridge 2004; a.o.). Novel evidence from Puyuma argues against this view, demonstrating instead that Philippine-type ''voice'' is hosted high in the left periphery, akin to a similar type of A-bar-agreement found in Western Nilotic. Its compatibility with Indo-European–type voice is therefore unsurprising. Not only does the current observation from Puyuma shed new light on a central debate in Austronesian syntax, lending new support to the accusative approach to Philippine-type languages and against the ergative analysis, but it also highlights the importance of approaching the divergent uses of the term “voice” in the literature with caution. The case of Puyuma thus reinforces the need to re-examine existing claims and conventional labels with data from understudied languages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006863/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006863<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of East Asian Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>austronesian-type voice, philippine-type voice, detransitivization, voice, argument structure alternation, a-bar agreement, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006863/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>698 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006863">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006863">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
