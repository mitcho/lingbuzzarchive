These stem from linguistic paradigms featuring language as a system designed and evolved for codifying the complexity of human thought in elaborate and intricate grammatical structures, demonstrated  mainly in written texts. In this context spontaneous linguistic exchanges in dialogues , universally demonstrated by all humans at all times are excluded from consideration both by linguists  and  evolutionary linguists. As a result the road from non-human communication to the complexities and intricacies of modern languages used in service of advanced civilization  has proven to be a major stumbling stone  for evolutionary linguistics  and often referred to in terms of miracles or just-so stories. 
In breaking with the tradition, I argue  that the language system is best represented  by spontaneous  dialogues of the average adult normal human. Language is a system for exchange of information by continuous communicative interactions by dialogues. 
Spontaneous dialogues are subconsciously accompanied by non-linguistic communicative body movements, which are multimodal , mostly instinctive, reactions as active participants in spoken dialogues by adding and/or clarifying the linguistic message. Thus, linguistic communication, most often articulated  by speech,  is part, although a major part, of a human communicative complex, or ecosystem which includes multimodal non-linguistics signals  e.g. facial expressions, body movements, manual gesticulations, e.g. pointing , etc. Human communication is a multimodal complex and language is explicable only as part of it. Given the latest findings that multimodality in non-human communication is the norm in species and given the assumption of continuity, genetic, epigenetic, developmental, cognitive, communicative, of humans as a life form, despite the prevalent attitudes of human superiority based on unmatched  linguistic abilities, I argue that the most realistic explanation of the evolution of language as behaviour and innate abilities, is in terms of restructuring of the non-human multimodal communicative complex  by giving priority to vocalizations and the evolution of speech, as behavioural evolution, and subsequent adaptation of human cognition  and physiology as evolutionary target aiming to facilitate this behaviour. Hypotheses  of language evolution featuring multimodality are to preferred to unimodal explanations.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006428/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006428<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language system, linguistic communication, language capacity, language origins, multimodality, primate communication, language evolution, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>371 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006428">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006428">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
