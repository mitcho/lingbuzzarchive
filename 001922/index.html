One promising solution to this problem is that children are equipped with helpful learning strategies that guide the types of generalizations made from the data. Two successful approaches in recent work for identifying these strategies have involved (i) expanding the set of informative data to include INDIRECT POSITIVE EVIDENCE, and (ii) using observable behavior as a target state for learning. We apply both these ideas to the case study of English anaphoric one, using computationally modeled learners who form their generalizations based on realistic data. We demonstrate that a learner biased to include indirect positive evidence coming from other pronouns in English can generate 18-month-old looking preference behavior. Interestingly, we find that the knowledge state responsible for this target behavior is a context-dependent representation for anaphoric one, rather than the adult representation, but this immature representation can suffice in many communicative contexts involving anaphoric one. More generally, these results suggest that children may be leveraging broader sets of data to make the syntactic generalizations leading to their observed behavior, rather than selectively restricting their input. We additionally discuss the components of the learning strategies capable of producing the observed behavior, including their origin and whether they may be useful for making other linguistic generalizations.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001922/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001922<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>anaphoric one, acquisition, computational modeling, indirect positive evidence, induction problems, online probabilistic learning, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001922/v2.pdf">v2 [August 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001922/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2013]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3499 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001922">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001922">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
