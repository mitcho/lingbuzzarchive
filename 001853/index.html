A particular problem for linearization has been how to proceed when two identical objects need to be linearized as is always the case when internal merge has taken place. The irreflexivity problem, that is, the problem of how to prevent an object from both preceding and following itself, can be solved if only one copy of the complex object is pronounced and all other copies of it are silent (see, e.g., Nunes 2004).

However, if irreflexivity is a problem for the externalization of language via the SM interface, why, asks J-R Vergnaud (p.c. 2010), must all but one copy still be silent when language is used privately, in silent, internal monologues where linearization should be irrelevant? I argue that linearization is forced by a physical brain internal condition, namely, the narrow bandwidth of the corpus callosum, which regulates the exchange of information between the two hemispheres. Computations which are serialized would require far less bandwidth than computations that proceed in parallel. This solution provides a brain-internal reason for linearization and thereby provides a conceptual argument against Pinker & Jackendoff’s (2005) assertion that the phonological component cannot be motivated given the view of Hauser, Chomsky, & Fitch (2002).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001853/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001853<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>linearization, externalized language, communication &amp; thought, corpus callosum, evolution, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>814 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001853">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001853">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
