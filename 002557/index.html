We argue that mood morphemes are polarity items, sensitive to the veridicality or nonveridicality of the higher verb. 

Crucially, we distinguish two levels of semantic representation where veridicality applies— (non)veridicality in the assertion vs. presupposition— while allowing the subjunctive/indicative morphemes to be sensitive to (non)veridicality in either level. Our two-tier theory allows for a number of mixed veridicality predicates thus explaining multiple mood patterns within a language, as well as variation across languages. Fluid, flexible mood patterns become thus quite expected in our system, in contrast to almost all previous accounts of mood that gave unidimensional semantics for the attitude predicates, therefore predicting rigid mood patterns, or lexical ambiguity for the selecting verbs. Overall, the emerging picture of the various verbs and selection patterns we discuss appear to necessitate an OT semantic framework for mood selection.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002557/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002557<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>subjunctive, nonveridicality, presupposition, optimality, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1841 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002557">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002557">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
