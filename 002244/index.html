This aim leads us to explore, then, how Greenberg's problem is derivative from Plato's problem. An approach to the logical problem of language acquisition in terms of a modified discovery procedure is proposed, which, based on learnability considerations, anchors the acquisition of abstract properties on perceptible ones. Within this enterprise, a learning constraint and a mechanism of data analysis, both instances of Third Factor principles, are argued to be at work in the growth of language in the individual. From the effects that the learning constraint and the mechanism of data analysis have on the resulting acquired I-languages, some patterns of synchronic and diachronic variation are derived.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002244/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002244<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD Thesis</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>learning mechanisms, patterns of morphosyntactic variation, language acquisition, morphosyntax, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1815 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002244">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002244">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
