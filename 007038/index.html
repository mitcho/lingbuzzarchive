On the basis of data available in the literature, it is shown that the morpheme no can be either a genitive marker, a relative pronoun or a neutral pronoun. In externally-headed relative clauses, no moves rightward and  adjoins to the right edge of its antecedent. Then, being a vector, it finds itself in a parallelogram of forces, and as a result it is demised by a bypass effect (Desouvrey 2021). In the so-called internally-headed relative clauses, no stays in situ in the matrix relative, and being a pronoun, as opposed to an anaphor, it can refer to any argument in the embedded (main) clause, hence the importance of pragmatic considerations for the interpretation of this construction. Furthermore, it is shown that the case alternation that occurs in relative clauses and certain complement clauses is due to the fact that all vectors alternately pair off with one another (pendulum effect). When relative no is paired off with a noun, it adjoins to it, which triggers the bypass of its case marker and that of the noun. Normally the accusative marker cannot be bypassed due to the fact that it is made up of a single segment (accusative singularity). However, in Kansai Japanese (Asano and Ura 2010), I show that the resultant of the parallelogram can reach a lower vector, the present tense verb, and as a result the accusative singularity is overridden, allowing the relative pronoun to surface.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007038/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007038<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>First draft</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntactic features, coreference, vectors, parallelogram law, bypass effect, pendulum effect, combination, phase, relative pronoun, ngc, agc, accusative singularity, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>431 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007038">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007038">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
