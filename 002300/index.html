for standard kinds of syntactic theories in which the notion of phrase
structure (or constituency) is taken to be a primitive in some way or
other.  Previous approaches within such theories essentially equate
nonconstituent coordination with coordination of full-fledged clauses
at some level of grammatical representation.  I present data from
Japanese that pose problems for such approaches and argue for an
alternative analysis in which the apparent nonconstituents are in fact
surface constituents having full-fledged meanings, couched in a
framework called Hybrid Type-Logical Categorial Grammar.

*This paper has been continuously on my webpage at least since the
 final version was finished in the spring of 2013 (and has been easily
 identifiable either by googling my name or the title of the paper),
 but it has recently come to my attention that some (multiple)
 individuals apparently could not locate it just from its author name
 and title. I am therefore posting it here in spite of the fact that a
 published version is going to appear very soon. It should be noted
 that this version is a preprint and therefore contains some minor
 typographical errors and stylistic infelicities.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002300/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002300<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Linguistic Inquiry 46(1)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>nonconstituent coordination, categorial grammar, hybrid type-logical categorial grammar, parasitic scope, late merge, japanese, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>710 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002300">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002300">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
