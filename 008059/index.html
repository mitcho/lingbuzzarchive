Heim (2019) pointed out φ-featural and Binding Theoretic problems that arise from the fact that Engdahl’s operator acts as a binder itself, and proposed to solve them by having the entire NP restrictor "picture of herself" in situ, while having a unary which attach to the question skeleton. In this paper, I make the novel observation that, to account for functional readings of sentences like "Which picture that John1 liked did he1 show no girl?", a covert type-shifting operator that I propose and is quite similar to, but still critically different from, Engdahl’s is necessary to type-shift the relative clause containing "John" because it must be interpreted only upstairs to account for the lack of disjoint reference effect. Then, I propose a further metasemantic constraint to block operators like Engdahl’s while still allowing mine, so that the problems pointed out by Heim can remain resolved.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008059/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008059<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>reconstruction, late merge, question semantics, functional reading, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/008059/v4.pdf">v4 [May 2024]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/008059/v3.pdf">v3 [May 2024]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/008059/v2.pdf">v2 [April 2024]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/008059/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2024]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1153 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008059">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008059">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
