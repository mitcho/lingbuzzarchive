In this brief contribution, we aim to reaffirm the role that syntactic selection plays in the domain of clausal embedding; that is, where verbs select for a complement of a particular syntactic type and a semantically (or pragmatically) equivalent utterance is sharply ungrammatical. Our specific focus is to synthesize a body of literature on the phenomenon of ‘optional’ (non-echo) wh-in-situ in wh-movement languages, arguing ultimately that syntactically, the phenomenon as such may not exist. What appears to be wh-in-situ in these languages may carry interrogative force as a speech act, but from a syntactic perspective is a declarative clause with a wh-expression in focus—a question with declarative syntax. The key evidence for this claim comes from selection/subcategorization, specifically the generalization that if a language has wh-movement (to Spec,CP), then wh-movement is obligatory in indirect (i.e., selected) questions. The relevant facts have been noted for individual languages, including English, but we offer here a meta-study, contending that this generalization holds systematically across all languages we have been able to examine, despite a wealth of variation along other dimensions. We discuss consequences of this generalization for accounts of wh-in-situ in questions with declarative syntax, and wh-movement in general, and provide a feature based analysis to derive these questions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002266/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002266<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Ángel J.
