It has two different readings: (a) the ‘partitive’ reading, as in "Huawei hired 40% of the locals", expresses the ratio of the locals hired by Huawei relative to all locals; (b) the ‘non-partitive’ reading, as in Huawei hired 40% locals, communicates the ratio of the locals hired by "Huawei relative to all Huawei’s hires". Based on relative measurement in Mandarin, I argue that the partitive reading and the non-partitive reading parallel the object-related reading and the event-related reading of numeral phrases. Compositionally, proportional number expressions are proposed to be degree quantifiers that take scope at different positions in the partitive reading and the non-partitive reading. The proposed analysis not only accounts for the event-related properties of the non-partitive reading, but also its intricate structural asymmetries and scope properties.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004903/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004903<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>relative measurement, event-related reading, scope of proportional number expressions, covert focus movement, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>162 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004903">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004903">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
