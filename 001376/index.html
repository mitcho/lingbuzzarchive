The strongest version of this proposal says that all quantification in natural language is over propositions. The empirical domain we investigate is split scope. The two syntactic problems we discuss are: (a) propositional quantification, despite the claim that it accounts elegantly for locality effects, needs to be supplemented with an independent theory of locality, and (b) because in this approach movement is not a crucial ingredient of scope, certain generalizations regarding when split scope is possible and impossible are missed. We show that our favored approach, choice function quantification, does not suffer from these problems. This discussion has consequences for the treatment of quantification in natural languages, as well as, more particularly, the treatment of indefinites, as some of the recent literature on indefinites couches their analysis within the propositional theory. Our contention, then, is that it may be possible to pursue a satisfactory account of indefinite behavior in terms of propositional quantification, but that that comes at the cost of treating indefinites separately from other quantifiers.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001376/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001376<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001376">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001376</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>split scope, propositional quantification, choice function quantification, disassociation, movement, agreement, locality, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>472 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001376">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001376">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
