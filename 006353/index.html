Based on previously unnoticed contrasts between standard counterfactuals and the non-canonical counterfactual construction “if not for φ, ψ” (hereafter NC, for “Not” Counterfactuals), this paper (i) presents new evidence for a distinction between epistemic and ontic readings of counterfactuals, (ii) develops a new account of this distinction, and (iii) argues that doing so requires enriching our models with causal laws (see e.g., Schulz, 2007). First, we show that NCs systematically reject inferences against the flow of causality, providing a point of contrast with standard counterfactuals, and supporting the existence of a separate epistemic reading for counterfactuals. We then show that NCs reject these inferences because, unlike standard counterfactuals, they presuppose the counterfactuality of their antecedents. After enriching the model with causal laws, we present an analysis in which NCs presuppose a fact, which fixes those facts lying causally upstream. This accounts for the new observation that NCs systematically reject non-causal epistemic inferences, while otherwise retaining their paraphrasability with standard counterfactuals.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006353/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006353<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>counterfactuals, negation, facts, causality, causal models, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>344 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006353">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006353">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
