The traditional perspective on classifiers can – somewhat peremptorily – be summarized as follows. Mensural classifiers are distinct from sortal classifiers. Mensural classifiers have to do with quantification, while sortal classifiers indicate the shape of the objects in their complement. The shape properties of sortal classifiers vary across languages without limits and in unpredictable ways. Only sortal classifiers are ‘true’ classifiers. Only languages with ‘obligatory’ classifiers are classifier languages.

I claim instead that classifiers do not vary across languages any more than phoneme inventories, nor are they particular to specific language groups. Their ‘obligatoriness’ is orthogonal to their nature. Rather, classifiers encode the result of a universal, internalist, and computational cognitive mechanism that describes the dynamic patterns of spatial distribution of the material denoted by the predicate in their complement. Classifiers do not simply denote shape, but rather the transformations into shapes that are afforded by the material in their complement. More precisely, the specific spatial distribution of classifiers can be formally analyzed in terms of Champollion's (2010) analysis of distributivity. These patterns of spatial distribution do not vary unrestrictedly: they are governed by two sets of computationally calculable parameters: Vector (force, magnitude, direction, boundedness) and Dimension (1/2/3D, axis inclusion, alignment). These predict a typology of classifiers that is both rich and constrained. These fundamental aspects of classifiers then in turn provide the grammatical scaffolding for the construal of individual and countable objects.

So-called 'mensural' classifiers are derived from 'sortal' classifiers by a process of grammaticalization. I propose a more fundamental distinction in the classifier domain between Samples and Pointers, each with distinct properties in terms of countability and spatial distribution. 'Countable' Samples (e.g. splash, drop, slice, spoonful) directly describe how specific materials distribute in space, while 'uncountable' Pointers (e.g. trace, whiff, tinge, note) indirectly encode spatial distribution. Samples operate through a mechanism of identity: a Sample is materially representative, identical to, and typical of the material sampled. Pointers operate via a mechanism of functional similarity: a Pointer does not need to be identical to the material they represent. This distinction is operationalized in some detail, and the consequences for a new understanding of collectives and the mass/ count distinction are spelled out.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008417/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008417<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>none</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>classifiers, mensural, sortal, collectives, mass, count, distribution, space, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>183 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008417">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008417">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
