Indefinite subjects (commonly quantified) in presentational sentences and related clause types may either occupy the complement position within the predicate phrase or “float” into various positions in the middle field. This is Subject Float, yielding variation such as “There would (many farmers) then (many farmers) probably (many farmers) be (?*many farmers) elected (many farmers)”. Conversely, and unexpectedly, definite NP subjects of some adjectival and verbal predicates must stay in the complement position. This is Low Subject Trapping, yielding orders such as “there is cold radiator-the” and “there cooled radiator-the”. It is shown that the licensing of subject NPs in the various positions in Subject Float and in the complement position in Low Subject Trapping is unrelated to specific grammatical cases, thus refuting the widely adopted case approach to NP licensing. Although Icelandic case marking has been widely discussed, Subject Float and Low Subject Trapping have not previously received a detailed scrutiny; these phenomena provide additional and partly new knockout arguments against the case approach to NP licensing and NP movement. While high NP raising to subject (Spec,IP) is unaffected by case, it seems to involve both Person and Topic matching.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004557/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004557<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In The sign of the V - papers in honour of Sten Vikner, ed. by Ken Ramshøj Christensen, Henrik Jørgensen & Johanna L.
