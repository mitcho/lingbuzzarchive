We review the empirical evidence for phonological regularity in prior research, including both categorical assessments of words and regularity at the granular level involving specific segments and contexts. Since the reporting of regularity is affected by human perceptual biases, we also document this regularity in a new data set of 2,228 sublexical errors that was collected using methods that are demonstrably less prone to bias. These facts validate the claim that sound errors are overwhelmingly regular, but the new evidence suggests speech errors admit more phonologically ill-formed words than previously thought. Detailed facts of the phonological structure of errors, including this revised standard, are then related to model assumptions in contemporary theories of phonological encoding.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004388/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004388<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>WIREs Cogn Sci. 2018;9:e1466</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>frequency, markedness, perceptual biases, phonotactics, speech errors, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>119 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004388">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004388">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
