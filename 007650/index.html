Moreover, conflicts are accompanied by negative emotions, such as envy, disappointment, anger, sadness, etc. These emotions become part of the conflict: 
they may inspire a sender to express them, and they may fuel emotions or instill new emotions in the receiving party. Consequently, emotions in conflicts are like oxygen to a fire, and the communication may become a vicious circle between two parties, both experiencing increasing emotions. Emotion regulation 
within the conflicting parties could stabilize the situation. As a means to regulation, a linguistic approach would tackle the vicious circle at the linguistic expression of emotions. We know that language may express 
emotions both explicitly and implicitly, and that speakers may or may not be aware of communicated emotions. Hearers will, consciously or not, process them. It may be expected that a reduction in the expressions of negative emotions will lead to a decrease of negative emotion. In this paper, we will identify 
various categories of (Dutch) linguistic expressions that may serve to communicate, covertly and maybe unconsciously, negative emotions. Subsequently, we will demonstrate how the toxic effect of verbal communication in conflict can be tempered by reducing or neutralizing the “guilty” expressions used in 
communication. Reducing these “guilty” expressions is demonstrated to cause decrease of negative emotions in conflict - thus breaking the vicious circle.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007650/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007650<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>emotion regulation, conflict, common ground, presupposition, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>232 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007650">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007650">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
