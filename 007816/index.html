and focus, influence the formal organization and content of two discoursal
components: word order, and referential coherence, based on Ekegusii, a
Bantu language spoken in Kenya.
The data for the study consists of corpora elicited using question-answer
coherence guided by pictures, and elicited monologic narratives. It uses an
eclectic approach in describing the role of information structure in
Ekegusii. It utilizes Lambrecht’s model of information structure, and
Bidirectional Optimality Theory to capture both production (by speaker)
and comprehension (by hearer) aspects in discourse. Centering Optimality
Theory is used to account for the discourse-pragmatics of referential
coherence.
The study found out that information structural constraints at the sentential
level mainly influence the information state of both canonical and noncanonical
constructions word orders. It influences the interpretation,
through the pragmatic structuring of propositions, helping the hearer
differentiate what is information (focus) in relation to a given topic, and
this may induce movement, insertion or deletion of some sentential
constituents. However, information structure optionally affects sentential
form in Ekegusii.
In relation to how information structure interacts with referential
coherence, the results of a corpus based analysis show that alternative ways
of coherently referring to participants using nominal expressions in the
roles of grammatical subject object and oblique depend on pragmatic
functions. Coherence was found out to be driven by a hard constraint
