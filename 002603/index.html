Jiménez-Fernández</a><br/>July 2015</center>&nbsp;<p></p>My goal in the present paper is to carry out an analysis of the syntactic and discourse properties of Information Focus (IF) in Southern Peninsular Spanish (SPS) and Standard Spanish (SS) varieties. Generally, it has been argued that IF tends to occur last in a sentence since new information is placed in final position, following the End-Focus Principle as well as the Nuclear Stress Principle (Zubizarreta 1998). Focus fronting has been hence reserved for those cases in which a clear contrast between two alternatives is established (Contrastive Focus and Mirative Focus; cf. Cruschina 2012). The starting hypothesis here is that IF can appear as a fronted element in a sentence and that SPS speakers show a higher degree of acceptability and grammaticality towards such constructions, as opposed to SS speakers. This points toward a certain degree of microparametric variation, which will be tested by means of a survey run among both SPS and SS speakers.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002603/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002603<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>southern peninsular spanish, standard spanish, information focus, mirative focus, contrastive focus, focus fronting, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1733 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002603">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002603">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
