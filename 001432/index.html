A goal feature is simply a uF that can find no match in its complement. I propose that before the point of phasal transfer, DELAYED VALUATION of uFs is possible either in situ within the same phase; or ex situ, by raising to c-command a potential valuer in a higher phase. uCase is a feature of D that finds no match in its complement NP, and therefore relies on DELAYED VALUATION in situ or by movement depending on the distance from a Case-licensor (see Bobaljik & Wurmbrand 2005 on two ways of valuing German nominative). The analysis of Case-driven movement converges in important respects with proposals of Boskovic (2007, 2011) while nonetheless permitting the attested in situ strategy.
 
Though the paper contributes to Case theory, its empirical core is a difference between West Germanic (WG) and Lubukusu complementizer agreement (CA) (see Haegeman 1992, Carstens 2003, Haegeman & van Koppen 2010 on the former; Diercks 2010 and to appear on the latter). WG CA reflects the features of the embedded subject, while Lubukusu CA agrees with the subject of the higher clause. I argue that WG CA is the low complementizer Finite in the cartography of Rizzi (1997); it can therefore probe the embedded subject upon Merge. In contrast Lubukusu’s agreeing C is the high, phasal complementizer Force, Merged after the subject is transferred to PF, so like uCase it finds no value in its complement. I argue that uPhi of Force obtains values by raising of ForceP to an outer Spec, vP for DELAYED VALUATION from the matrix subject. The movement analysis is motivated by the fact that uPhi of Force agree with the subject even when ForceP is Merged within the VP complement to a phasal Applicative head (cf. McGinnis 2001). Absent raising, ForceP would be transferred to PF unvalued. The applied object (IO) itself cannot value uPhi of Force, I argue, because Lubukusu subjects and IOs contrast in that the latter are Case-licensed in situ (cf. Halpert 2011) while the former are not; hence IOs are “deactivated” and cannot value Lubukusu agreeing C.

After presenting the analysis of contrasting complementizer agreement varieties and developing the theory of DELAYED VALUATION, my paper explores German nominative in detail and then relates the proposals to agreement displacement (cf. Bejar & Rezac 2009), creating a unified approach. Lastly I argue, somewhat speculatively, that raising of a uF to be closest c-commandee may suffice to provide DELAYED VALUATION. Directionality of search arises always and only for derivational reasons at first Merge (Epstein 1998); hence the conclusion in (1):

(1) MECHANICS OF DELAYED VALUATION: uF with no match in its c-command domain at Merge may be valued:

(i) Ex situ, by raising into locality with a matching feature in a higher phase, OR
(ii) In situ, by a matching feature within the same phase.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001432/current.pdf?_s=Z0nZOu_zOtuHk5wj">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001432<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001432">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001432</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Syntax DOI 10.111/synt.12116</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agreement, complementizer agreement, case, lubukusu, bantu, german, a-movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v16.pdf?_s=s8SGyFfeVI1tXMbb">v16 [December 2013]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v15.pdf?_s=QWTweAg51l80mgHQ">v15 [February 2013]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v14.pdf?_s=9ceh81FzXilytgL5">v14 [February 2013]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v13.pdf?_s=XTTDPGkMg635mZIq">v13 [October 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v12.pdf?_s=fyftlgD-wKsVb2SC">v12 [February 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v11.pdf?_s=FHOjLjjArojBW-zY">v11 [February 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v10.pdf?_s=8p2hlp-LH0PFe-B2">v10 [January 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v9.pdf?_s=l4n5GABn7ojftBnW">v9 [January 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v8.pdf?_s=J8zqEuhxkW9yC5TV">v8 [January 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v7.pdf?_s=9NegKY3Kx6QPGhhq">v7 [January 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v6.pdf?_s=INbphUkcdmopBv_K">v6 [January 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v5.pdf?_s=vxgCo-jcv7krM3kG">v5 [January 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v4.pdf?_s=irZrDO_FwMdGEwNo">v4 [January 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v3.pdf?_s=9KBt5sSyE9h-Zyf_">v3 [January 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v2.pdf?_s=D6SzBfuwc11_paqo">v2 [January 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001432/v1.pdf?_s=-Su_95l4IIVQ47Mt">v1 [January 2012]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1897 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001432?_s=ytCh1FTp5NH1GP2X&amp;_k=X81VxilKjN8VDXxW&amp;2">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001432?_s=ytCh1FTp5NH1GP2X&amp;_k=X81VxilKjN8VDXxW&amp;3">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
