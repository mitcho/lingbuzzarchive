The phenomenon, also known as deferred uses (Nunberg, 1993), is  characterised by a pronoun’s dependency on the identification of a specific individual in the context that provides it with a descriptive (as opposed to a singular or specific) interpretation. Moreover, the identification of the salient individual seems to make the interpretation available  in a rather indirect way. For example, by pointing at a huge footprint in  the sand and uttering ‘He must be a giant’, the speaker can convey that the footprint maker must be a giant, where the mental representation  footprint (necessary for identification) and the representation the footprint- maker (the pronoun’s interpretation) are not identical (but still related).  These uses also display interesting properties when it comes to their ability to provide antecedents for other pronominal expressions. This phenomenon is at the cross road of many topics in philosophy of language and linguistics, as it shares similarities with  deictic  and anaphoric uses of pronouns as well as metonymy, a figurative use of language.   In this thesis, I propose that the data is best accounted for by a combination of relevance-theoretic pragmatics (Sperber and Wilson 1995, Carston 2002), motivated assumptions about visual  information processing, and the grammar formalism of Dynamic Syntax (Kempson et al 2001; Cann et al 2005).  DS models pronouns as procedures that encode a variable-like entity (e.g. a metavariable), which  needs to be replaced by a semantic value (of the appropriate type), allowing for descriptive constituents, which emerge as a result of relevance-driven processes of identification and inference, to provide the pronoun with the  relevant descriptive interpretation. These can hold either at the explicit or implicit levels of meaning, depending on the type of pronoun used and contextual factors.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001512/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001512<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University College London</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pronouns, anaphora, deixis, indexicality, ellipsis, pragmatics, semantics, relevance theory, dynamic syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>142 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001512">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001512">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
