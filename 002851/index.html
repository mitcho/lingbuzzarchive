Under the proposed analysis, the problem with the movement of YP out of moved element XP does not arise at the point of movement of YP out of XP, as has been previously assumed; the problem arises already with the movement of XP, i.e. XP itself cannot undergo movement in this caseâ€”any later movement out of moved XP is then trivially blocked. The proposed deduction of the ban in question leaves room for movement out of moved elements to take place in one well-defined context, which is shown to be borne out. The paper also has consequences for the timing of labeling and provides a new perspective on the traditional Adjunct Condition (i.e. the ban on movement out of adjuncts). It is shown that movement out of adjuncts is possible in the same configuration as movement out of moved elements. The proposed account of the ban on movement out of moved elements is then extended to the Adjunct Condition based on a new treatment of adjuncts.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002851/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002851<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Linguistic Inquiry</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>locality, labels, phases, freezing effects, successive cyclic movement, adjuncts, agreement</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002851/v2.pdf">v2 [December 2016]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002851/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1409 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002851">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002851">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
