In this article, I present and defend a theory of the internal readings of symmetrical predicates such as <i>different</i> and <i>the same</i> in which the meaning of such predicates is taken to contain the meaning of a reciprocal pronoun. The theory is shown to be able to account for the truth conditions of sentences in which the antecedent of a symmetrical predicate is a quantificational DP, sentences in which <i>the same</i> is used as part of a partitive construction, sentences containing multiple symmetrical predicates, and sentences in which a symmetrical predicate is under the scope of a negation. In addition, I present a novel theory of the semantics of reciprocal pronouns that is capable of assigning adequate truth conditions to sentences in which a right-node-raised reciprocal pronoun is anteceded by more than one DP simultaneously and sentences in which the antecedent of a reciprocal pronoun is a DP headed by a determiner like <i>most</i> and <i>no</i>. Both these theories are HPSG-based and representationalist, involving constraints on the form of semantic representations and, in the case of the former, even operations that copy and modify parts of semantic representations.

Version history: <br/>
v3: Further problems with the <i>lep</i> function and the MRS Adjustment Rule 1 have been fixed.<br/>
v2: In the theory presented in Version 1, the <i>lep</i> function and the MRS Adjustment Rule 1 were interacting in the wrong way. That has been rectified in Version 2, mainly by making modifications to the MRS Adjustment Rule 1.
