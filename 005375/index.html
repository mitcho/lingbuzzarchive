On this approach, movement/agreement correlations are treated as default, and movement/anti-agreement correlations are treated as exceptional. By contrast, I argue, with evidence from Romance Past Participle Agreement (PPA) and Mayan Agent Focus constructions, that both movement/agreement correlations and movement/anti-agreement correlations are derivable from the same underlying interactions between merge and agree. The present paper focuses not just on the order of internal merge and agree, but on the timing of external merge as well. On the proposed analysis, merge (internal and external) and agree are not causally related, but are ordered according to economy conditions on the derivation, which are sensitive to the features of the functional pro- jections in a given clause and the arguments they introduce (Longenbaugh, 2019, with insights from Müller 2010). I propose a set of such conditions, which sometimes require external merge to precede any other operation, and sometimes require external merge to follow another operation, depending on the features of the language/construction. Following Longenbaugh (2019), the time at which the subject is externally merged affects case on the object in Romance, which affects whether or not it is accessible to agree (Bobaljik, 2008; Preminger, 2014). The result is a movement-agreement correlation: in situ objects are inaccessible to agree, but A-moved ones are accessible. I propose that Mayan Agent Focus instantiates a movement/anti-agreement correlation for similar reasons. The timing of external merge is predicted to be different for transitive clauses than for subject wh-questions in high absolutive Mayan languages. The resulting structure of each generates a different agreement alignment, the latter of which makes the object a more local goal for the probe that would normally target the subject. The result is an anti-agreement correlation: wh-movement of the subject results in a derivation in which the subject is a non-local φ-goal, so its features are not cross-referenced on the verb.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005375/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005375<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>merge, agree, economy, agree, anti-agreement, romance, mayan, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>228 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005375">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005375">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
