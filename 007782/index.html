The key idea is to allow certain linguistic expressions to be sensitive to the intermediate status of a syntactic proof. The relevant conditions can be stated concisely as constraints at the level of the proof term language, which is formally a special type of lambda calculus. The proposed analysis does not have any direct analog to either of the two familiar techniques in the syntactic literature for analyzing extraction pathway marking, namely, successive cyclic movement in derivational syntax and the SLASH feature percolation in HPSG. It nonetheless captures the relevant empirical patterns at least equally successfully. This new analysis is conceptually revealing as well: on the 'meaning-centered' perspective that emerges naturally from this approach, extraction pathway marking essentially boils down to a strategy that certain languages employ for overtly flagging the existence of a semantic variable inside a partially derived linguistic expression whose interpretation is dependent on a higher-order operator located in a structurally distant position. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007782/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007782<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>extraction, long-distance dependencies, extraction pathway marking, type-logical grammar, hybrid type-logical grammar, proof theory, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>460 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007782">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007782">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
