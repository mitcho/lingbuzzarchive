It traces the development of modern cognitive science from its 17th century origins through to its first flowering in the mid 20th century, and provides detailed sketches of the development of the various subfields of cognitive science since then (following the “Sloan Hexagon”, Fig 8.1, p 523, these are philosophy, psychology, computer science, neuroscience, anthropology and linguistics, - and their various hybrids such as psycholinguistics, neuropsychology, etc). Cognitive science is deliberately defined rather broadly, so as to include the study of all mental processes (including emotion, motor control and motivation, in addition to ‘purely’ cognitive aspects of psychology such as language, reasoning, perception, etc; see pp. 10f. for discussion). The book is therefore very rich and extremely informative.
However, as a theoretical linguist working on comparative syntax from a Chomskyan perspective, I was dismayed by much of the chapter dealing with linguistics (Chapter 9 “Transforming Linguistics”, pp. 590-700). This article is an attempt to fill in a gap in Boden’s presentation concerning Chomsky’s work in syntax since 1965, and to reflect on why this work has been overlooked here, and why, more generally, mainstream cognitive scientists (non-linguists workingin fields that are, by any definition of cognitive science, allied to linguistics under the cognitive science umbrella) feel that this work can safely be overlooked.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001611/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001611<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>unpublished</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>cognitive science, generative grammar, chomsky, syntax, parameters, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2294 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001611">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001611">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
