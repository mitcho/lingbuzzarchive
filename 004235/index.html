For one thing, it is often assumed
that language change is explanatory, in that it provides a reasonable answer to what Haspelmath dubbed
‘Greenberg’s Problem’ in 2014: why are languages the way they are? A short version of the Greenbergian
answer is: ‘Because they became that way through processes of language change.’ However, this sort of
answer throws into focus the fact that language change is not only a potential explanation for language
structures. Rather, it is a set of problems that itself calls for explanation. In fact, this could be called
‘Greenberg’s Second Question’: why do languages change the way they do? In this article, we explore some
ways in which the field of experimental pragmatics might shed light on the second question, by providing a
set of methods that could investigate existing hypotheses about language change by developing falsifiable
predictions to be evaluated in experimental settings. Moreover, these hypotheses can provide new research
questions and data for experimentalists to work on, beyond the rather restricted set of questions that
experimental pragmatics has confronted to date.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004235/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004235<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistics Vanguard</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pragmatics, experimental pragmatics, semantics, grammaticalization, language change, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>93 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004235">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004235">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
