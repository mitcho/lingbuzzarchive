Furthermore, it has been argued that in order to account for antipresuppositions, it is necessary to postulate an independent pragmatic principle called Maximize Presuppositions!, which states that the sentence with the the stronger presupposition should be preferred whenever its presupposition is satisfied.In parallel, presuppositional theories of slurs (Cepollaro, 2015, 2017; Cepollaro and Stojanovic, 2016; Schlenker, 2007) maintain that while these expressions  encode  the  same  truth-conditional  content  as  their  neutral counterparts, they trigger a presupposition that accounts for their derogatory potential. In this squib, I argue that presuppositional theories of slurs together with Maximize Presuppositions!predict that the use of a neutral counterpart triggers an antipresupposition to the effect that the presupposition of the corresponding slur is not satisfied.  As a result, the view incorrectly predicts (i) that it is infelicitous to use the neutral counter-part in contexts where the slur’s presupposition is satisfied and (ii) that a felicitous use of the neutral counterpart in a context that is unspecific w.r.t. the pejorative presupposition typically triggers the inference that the presupposition of the corresponding slur is not satisfied<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005875/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005875<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>NALS</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>slurs;presuppositions;antipresuppositions;maximize presuppositions!, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>306 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005875">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005875">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
