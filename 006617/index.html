But not always. We develop a proposal to predict when strict readings are available by using prosodic cues to distinguish between weak and strong reflexives. In a nutshell, we will propose – in the spirit of Kayne’s 2002 proposal – that Condition A derives from movement (remerging) of the antecedent from a position next to the reflexive (roughly as in the case of intensifiers) into a theta position. This will explain the link between reflexives and intensifiers, since under this hypothesis, they originate from the same underlying structure. This will also account for strict readings of reflexives since the trace of the antecedent (a copy of the antecedent) can be literally interpreted in the ellipsis site (or in the focus alternatives). Additionally, we will argue that reflexives must form covert self-predicates whenever syntactically and semantically possible. This constraint entails a restriction on strict readings that has previously not been (seriously) taken into consideration: as we will explain, only strong reflexives (not weak reflexives)  can trigger strict readings.
