This paper describes and analyzes phonological processes pertinent to the glottal stop in A'ingae morphologically complex verbs. A'ingae verbal suffixes are organized in two morphophonological domains, or strata. Within the inner domain, glottal stops assign stress to the syllable which contains the second mora to the left of the glottal stop. In the outer domain, glottal stops do not have any effect on stress. In addition, some verbal suffixes delete stress (they are dominant). Dominance is unpredictable and independent of the suffix's morphophonological domain, but dominance and phonological stratification interact in a non-trivial way: Stress-deleting suffixes of the inner domain also delete glottalization, but stress-deleting suffixes of the outer domain leave glottalization intact.

The main theoretical import of the study resides in the architecture of the A'ingae grammar, which requires a phonological formalism capable of (i) modeling phonological stratification while (ii) allowing for morpheme-specific phonological idiosyncrasies which (iii) interact with the phonological grammar of their stratum. The formalism I adopt is Cophonologies by Phase (henceforth CbP; e.g. Sande, Jenks, and Inkelas, 2020). CbP fulfills the above desiderata by associating cophonologies, or morphologically-specific phonological grammars, with (i) phase heads as well as (ii) individual morphosyntactic features, which (iii) compile together to yield the phonological ranking applied at spell-out.

Secondary theoretical implications pertain to Goldsmith's (1990) notion of segmental licensing and Alderete's (1999, 2001) AntiFaithfulness. To model the relationship between glottalization and stress, I propose that within the inner (but not the outer) domain, the glottal stop is licensed by a metrical foot. I model stress deletion as antifaithfulness to input stress. Finally, I propose that antifaithfulness to a licenser entails antifaithfulness to its licensees, which captures the fact that only the inner dominant suffixes delete glottalization.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006462/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006462<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dabkowski, a'ingae, cofán, cofan, kofán, kofan, kofane, isolate, amazon, amazonia, amazonian, morphosyntax, cophonology, co-phonology, theory, cpt, ct, glottalization, glottal, stop, closure, representational, non-representational, verb, verbal, inflectional, derivational, inflection, derivation, agglutinating, agglutination, predicate, creaky, creak, f0, amplitude, length, stress, interface, recessive, recessiveness, dominant, dominance, grammar, ecuador, colombia, foot, feet, trochaic, trochee, metrification, meter, metrical, structure, deletion, deleting, erasing, erasure, faithfulness, antifaithfulness, anti-faithfulness, gradient, symbolic, representations, gsr, gradience, floating, tone, negative, accent, accentual, pitch, tone, defective, prosodic, prosody, optimality, ot, stratal, markedness, reversal, suffix, suffixation, affix, affixation, prominence, prominent, laryngeal, larynx, glottis, weight, diphthong, diphthongal, morphophonology, morphonology, indexed, constraint, indexation, indexing, licensing, licensor, licensee, ranking, align, alignment, transderivational, cophonologies, co-phonologies, by, phase, cbp, cp, phrase, ph(r)ase, phasal, phrasal, conditioning, conditioned, trigger, multiple, underlying, surface, process, input, output, correspondence, morphology, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006462/v2.pdf">v2 [February 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006462/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>420 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006462">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006462">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
