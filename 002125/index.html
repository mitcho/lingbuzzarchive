In a recent summary paper, Stepanov (2007) suggests that the challenges facing the CED are so great that it should be abandoned. This paper defends a Minimalist reinterpretation of the central observation of the CED based on Uriagareka’s (1999) Multiple Spell-Out. The implication is that given a certain theory of linearization, the strong islandhood of certain kinds of specifiers and adjuncts is attributable to the requirements of the PF-interface, more specifically the need for total linear order of terminals. Differences between derived vs. externally-merged specifiers and head-initial vs. head-final phrases are argued to fall out from Uriagereka’s approach if a copy theory of labeling is adopted. Initial research suggests that the behavior of adjuncts, though more complex, potentially result from the same linearization process, with the added complications that: (i) there is no selection involved in the merger of adjuncts; and (ii) for this reason late merger is also possible (cf. Lebeaux 1991). It is also proposed that this general approach to the CED allows a conceptually-motivated unification of Chomsky’s notion of phase and Uriagereka’s Multiple Spell-Out: a phase is any phrase with an externally merged specifier.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002125/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002125<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In S.
