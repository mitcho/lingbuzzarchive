Language and algebra take their structure from two laws in physics; and algebra is a subset of language. 1) Through its property of discreteness, words take their structure from the quantum property of matter, where phonemes are digits, words are numbers, and the phoneme chart is a periodic table. 2) Sentences take their structure from Newton’s ‘equal and opposite’, where the rudimentary equation ‘A equals B’ is a symmetrical sentence in which ‘A’ and ‘B’ are Nouns, and ‘equals’ is the Verb: Noun-Verb-Noun. Algebra is a mirror of physics because ‘A=B’ is a manifestation, in symbols, of a law in physics, where ‘A’ and ‘B’ are ‘equal and opposite’ to one another. The evolution of biological objects, such as an eye or a wing, is governed by formulas in algebra, which represent physics, and do not, themselves, evolve. Language emerges from the same source as the formulas, not the material objects. The modern Subject-Verb-Object S-V-O Sentence is an asymmetrical modification of an archaic, symmetrical Noun-Verb-Noun Sentence. Mediated by the right hand acting as Subject+Verb, when the Sentence became asymmetrical, it carried the brain with it. Modern Sentences are historical modifications of S-V-O. Unmotivated in the historical process, the passive voice is in a class by itself, and may be an outright invention –and the shibboleth that killed the
