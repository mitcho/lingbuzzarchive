Important typological work by Nichols (1986) distinguished marking the head of a grammatical relationship (head-marking) from marking of the dependent (dependent-marking).  In addition, the relationship between co-heads in an extended projection may also be marked.  To these three forms of marking this paper adds a further parameter: the distinction between affixes and particles as markers of the relevant relationship.  Exploring this parameter leads to a more restrictive theory of marking grammatical dependencies, whereby of the three forms of marking, only dependent-marking is available for particles.  It will be argued that this restriction can be derived from the assumption that particles head their own projection, whereas affixes do not.  The empirical means of testing the theory is provided by linkers  syntactically independent, semantically vacuous particles indicating a relationship between two items.  Using data from a variety of languages, it is shown firstly that linkers in the complex noun phrase may be used to mark any head-dependent relationship, and secondly that the linker always marks the dependent: constituency tests from fronting, coordination and deletion, as well as independent morphosyntactic properties, indicate that the linker is invariably attached to the dependent.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000878/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000878<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dependency, head-marking, dependent-marking, affix, particles, linkers, morphosyntax, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>368 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000878">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000878">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
