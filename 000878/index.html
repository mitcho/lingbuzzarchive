Important typological work by Nichols (1986) distinguished marking the head of a grammatical relationship (head-marking) from marking of the dependent (dependent-marking). In addition, the relationship between co-heads in an extended projection may also be marked. To these three forms of marking this paper adds a further parameter: the distinction between affixes and independent syntactic words as markers of the relevant relationship. Exploring this parameter leads to a more restrictive theory of marking grammatical dependencies, whereby of the three forms of marking, only dependent-marking is available for independent syntactic words. It is argued that this restriction can be derived from three assumptions: (i) independent syntactic words head a projection in their own right in the syntax; affixes do not; (ii) if the marker of a grammatical relationship heads its own functional projection, it is subject to a structural intervention requirement; (iii) principles of Extended Projection (Grimshaw 2000, 2005). The empirical means of testing the theory is provided by linkers – syntactically independent, semantically vacuous words indicating a relationship between two items. Using data from genetically and geographically diverse languages, it is shown firstly that linkers may be used to mark a variety of head-dependent relationships, but never the relationship between co-heads in an extended projection, and secondly that the linker always marks the dependent: constituency tests from fronting, coordination and deletion, as well as independent morphosyntactic properties, indicate that the linker is invariably attached to the dependent.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000878/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000878<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dependency, head-marking, dependent-marking, affix, particles, linkers, ezafe, extended projection, morphosyntax, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000878/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2009]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>618 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000878">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000878">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
