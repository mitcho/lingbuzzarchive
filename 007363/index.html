We provide an update on the research questions that guide generative linguistics as well as on the methodologies that synthesize the evidential basis of the field, reflecting three crucial dimensions: (i) the importance of having strong theories, (ii) the relation between theory and measurements, and (iii) the results this coupling of theory and measurements has produced in the last three decades of generative research. Putting these three dimensions together, our discussion examines the answers the Miminalist Program and the research that was developed on its basis offer with respect to how Language works (behavior), through the experimental lens we have on its operation (observables), in the form of a principled approach to what has been measured, why so, and what are the adduced explanations (theory).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007363/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007363<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in the Cambridge Handbook of Mimimalism</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>minimalism, methodology, theory, data, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>781 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007363">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007363">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
