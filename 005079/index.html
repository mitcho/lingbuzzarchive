Until now, the prevalent view has been that their evolution follows one of the two diachronic paths: either they stop co- occurring with determiners (French, Spanish) or they start requiring their presence (European Portuguese). Contrary to the common analysis which associates the first case with a transition from a modifier to a determiner semantics of possessives and the second with a retention of a modifier semantics (e.g. Alexiadou 2004), we propose that the only change affecting all Romance languages is the passage from NP to DP grammar, while the semantics of possessives stays unchanged. We argue that the only point of evolutionary divergence is which of the two pre-existing possessive paradigms language retains. Using novel quantitative corpus data, we show for the first time that French, Spanish, and Portuguese undergo exactly the same diachronic evolution: the frequency of determiners goes monotonously up with one possessive paradigm (long forms) and goes up and then down with the other (short forms). The paper contributes to our understanding of evolutionary divergence and convergence, the nature of language change, and the morphosyntax and semantics of possessive DPs by adducing empirical evidence from three novel cases of failed change.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005079/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005079<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>adnominal possessives, language change, failed change, dp structure, dp semantics, romance languages, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005079/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>232 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005079">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005079">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
