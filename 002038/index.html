orientation of current work in the field of linguistics: "If you, like Chomsky, are primarily interested in cognitive psychology, your specific perspective on the entire generative enterprise might be somewhat different from the one of someone who is just interested in language and language data" (2010:68). Although it is clear that many researchers may embrace this view, further claiming that their interest is in the faculty of language and not in language data, it is less clear whether this embracement comes along with work that aims to do something more than discussing grammatical phenomenon A in language B in great technical detail. This report addresses the languistics/linguistics divide by reporting on the workings of a two-day event (Comparative Biolinguistics: An Exploratory Workshop) held in November 2013, at the University of Barcelona’s Department of General Linguistics. The goal of the workshop was to make progress with respect to establishing interdisciplinary linking hypotheses within a perspective of extended synthesis for the faculty of language.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002038/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002038<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Biolinguistics 8: 053–066.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>comparative biolinguistics, comparative linguistics, variation, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>517 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002038">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002038">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
