to the phenomenology of dislocation in Modern Standard Arabic, henceforth
MSA. The first of these research questions concerns the possible types of dislocation
constructions. The second question concerns the interpretation of dislocation
constructions. The last question takes on the syntactic make-up of
dislocation constructions.
As far as the first question is concerned, I argue that left-peripheral elements
in MSA are not uniform and thus they are best analyzed as comprising
two different types: Clitic Left Dislocation I and Clitic Left Dislocation II. I
further argue that the same constructions which appear in the left periphery
have a presence in the right periphery, namely Clitic Right Dislocation I and
Clitic Right Dislocation II. I further show that the determining factor underlying
the partitioning of clitic resumption in MSA is morphological case (mis)-
matching. Concerning the second question, I maintain that the interpretation
of dislocation constructions in MSA is rooted in contrastiveness: the idea that
the dislocated elements are drawn from a contrast set in the discourse.
As an answer to the third question, which constitutes the backbone of this
thesis, I argue that the previous literature, which advances the idea that the
dislocated element and its associated clitic in Clitic Left Dislocation I & Clitic
Right Dislocation I coappear in the same clause, is empirically and conceptually
problematic. As a solution to this impasse, I argue for the bisentential
analysis: the idea that the dislocated element originates in a different clause
from the clitic. Crucially, this thesis contributes to the ’biclausal’ debate by furnishing
an argument for an ellipsis-based analysis of Clitic Left Dislocation I
& Clitic Right Dislocation I based on data from MSA.
