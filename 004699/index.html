se constructions. Detailed morpho-syntactic and semantic analyses are provided with the aim of sustaining three main theses. First, the common property behind this pattern is a syntactically unsatisfied subcategorization feature present in the Voice head, which is satisfied at PF through the introduction of the clitic se. Second, theta-roles are syntactic primitives that can be assigned in a long-distance fashion up to argument activity (aka syntactic visibility) plus some locality conditions. Third, at LF, theta-roles are semantically realized as functions from entities to event predicates (i.e., < e,< s, t >>) on K(ase) heads. This last thesis conceives of structural K as an argument introducer mediating between predicates (pure event properties) and arguments, whose particular semantics is syntactically determined; i.e., via allosemy.

[NB: My last stance on SE-syncretism can be found in lingbuzz (under the title "Deconstructing Voice"). I gave up with part of the story told in this version (in particular with the radical view of SE as a PF expletive), but I will leave here as I think that someone can disagree with my last stance.]<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004699/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004699<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under revision</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>case, theta-roles, se-constructions, spanish, syncretism, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004699/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>613 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004699">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004699">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
