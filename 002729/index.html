Morphologically, we observe two asymmetries: (i) in lexical nouns, number-driven root-suppletion is common whilst case-driven root-suppletion is virtually unattested; (ii) in contrast, pronouns commonly supplete for both number and case. By and large, we see the same pattern in verbs, observing a contrast between lexical verbs and auxiliaries with regard to suppletion for aspect and tense. In order to account for these asymmetries, I appeal to structural differences between lexical and functional material, combined with locality effects as proposed in Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz 1993). Crucially, lexical material contains a category-defining node which has a delimiting effect that causes case/tense to be insufficiently local to the root to condition its suppletion. In contrast, functional material lacks category-defining nodes and thus no delimiting effect is observed and case/tense are free to condition suppletion of the functional base. Phonologically, we see a correlation between the presence of a category-defining node and the absence of dominant prefixes in vowel harmony and lexical accent, whilst in the absence of a category-defining node dominant prefixes are attested. Thus, I argue for universal limitations on suppletion patterns and dominant prefixes, which crucially derive from a difference in morpho-syntactic structure between lexical and functional material.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002729/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002729<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD dissertation, University of Connecticut</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>suppletion, distributed morphology, allomorphy, locality, phonology/morphology interface, vowel harmony, lexical stress, morphology, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>947 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002729">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002729">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
