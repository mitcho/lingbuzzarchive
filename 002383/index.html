This paper investigates the social reasons that a speaker might choose or avoid the less ambiguous form.  In view of the semantics of "need to", the speaker who utters you need to unambiguously acts as if she is familiar with the hearer’s priorities and licensed to tell him what is good for him – a socially risky move.  I therefore predict that "you need to" will be more appropriate and thus more common from people with knowledge about the relevant domain; people in authority over the hearer;  and people who play a mentoring role in the hearer’s life, because these people are more likely to be licensed to tell the hearer what is good for him in the context.  I find evidence consistent with these predictions by investigating corpora that contain information about how the speaker and hearer relate to each other.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002383/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002383<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002383">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002383</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Selected Papers from NWAV 43 (U.
