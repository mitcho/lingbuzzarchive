acquisition. Acquisition and fieldwork approaches are united by the goal to understand
the representational systems of the grammars under inquiry (developing
or adult). They differ in what is known and unknown. In language acquisition
we typically know a lot about language specific target constructions, but not the
development of full competency, while in fieldwork we don’t know as much about
those targets, but we can trust that adult speakers have full competency. When we
design child studies, we create replicable sets of carefully controlled contexts and
stimuli. Focusing on a few methodological paradigms that have been successful
for deepening our understanding of modal development, we consider the advantages
and challenges associated with adapting these methods to study underdescribed
languages. We speculate on how fieldworkers might be able to make the
best use of these methods, in a way that complements existing methods.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006894/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006894<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Modality in Underdescribed Languages: Methods and Insights; Berlin: De Gruyter</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>modals, modality, acquisition, fieldwork, methods, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>238 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006894">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006894">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
