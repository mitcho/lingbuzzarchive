Using corpus data from Laurentian French (Saguenay, Quebec), we test the hypothesis that prominence is phonologically assigned to non-final syllables to signal weight contrasts. Our results demonstrate that this is indeed the case, with both codas and heavy vowels attracting prominence away from final syllables, particularly when the final syllable is open. In terms of phonetic realisation, we observe that the primary cues to prominence in French are higher pitch and longer durations, consistent with descriptions in the literature, with higher amplitude additionally manipulated to signal weight but not phrasal prominence. With regards to the phonological representation, we interpret these findings as indicating that the location of prominence can signal syllable weight and that this prominence is best formally expressed as a pitch accent due to its attraction to word-level properties. 	<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005782/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005782<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Glossa (Submitted)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>french, weight, prominence, prosody, laurentian, quebec, quebecois, canadian french, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005782/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>881 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005782">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005782">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
