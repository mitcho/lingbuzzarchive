We therefore get optionality in our experimental data which we take to represent Colloquial German. Since Standard German lacks this kind of optionality, the set of grammatical verb clusters is much smaller in Standard German than in Colloquial German. All orders which are grammatical in Standard German are also grammatical in Colloquial German, making Standard German a subset of Colloquial German.

While Standard and Colloquial German thus exhibit substantial differences in terms of surface strings, the underlying grammatical difference is only minimal according to the syntactic analysis presented here. Standard German imposes a complexity requirement on auxiliary inversion but Colloquial German does not. Given the apparently idiosyncratic nature of the complexity feature, the lack of such a feature in Colloquial German implies that the grammar of Colloquial German is less complex than the grammar of Standard German. We show that the optionality found with auxiliary inversion in Colloquial German is something which follows for free given our syntactic analysis.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000751/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000751<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under revision</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>experimental evidence, german, optionality, verb clusters, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>848 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000751">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000751">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
