entail there to have been a preceding (temporal) event of the kind named by the verb they 

are derived from, e.g.darkened in a darkened portion of skin. Building on Gawrons (2009) 

recent observations regarding the semantics of extent uses of change of state verbs (e.g., 

Kims skin darkens between the knee and the calf) and Kennedy and Levins (2008) theory 

of change, it is shown, contrary to previous analyses, that a fully compositional semantic 

analysis is possible, and thus that there is no argument from derived statives for word 

formation differing from semantic composition above the word level in requiring deletion 

operations, as in Dubinsky and Simangos (1996) analysis. Further, such an analysis, by 

contrast with previous ones, both compositional (Jackson 2005b; Condoravdi and Deo 2008) 

and non-compositional (Dubinsky and Simango 1996), correctly predicts, as shown by a 

range of arguments, that the meaning of the derived stative contains the meaning of the 

verb it is derived from and that it therefore contrasts fundamentally with morphologically 

simple adjectives in the kind of meaning that it has.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001209/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001209<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In press in Linguistics and Philosophy</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>deverbal adjectives, derived statives, spatial change, result states, morphology, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001209/v3.pdf">v3 [February 2011]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001209/v2.pdf">v2 [February 2011]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001209/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2011]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>978 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001209">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001209">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
