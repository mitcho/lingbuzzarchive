We examined the factors that contribute to secondary stress realization in a rating study, where listeners were asked to rate compounds pronounced without secondary stress and with secondary stress in various locations. We refine some generalizations from impressionistic descriptions: in compounds whose left-hand stems have mobile lexical stress, acceptability of secondary stress decreases with token frequency of the compound, and acceptability of pronunciations without stress increases with frequency. Ratings improve as distance between stresses increases, and this effect is gradient rather than categorical. We also identify new generalizations about secondary stress that relates to the properties of the left-hand stem. First, we identify a faithfulness effect: stress realization is optional on lexically stressed stems, but stress movement is strongly penalized. Second, we identify a sonority sequencing effect: secondary stress is not tolerated well on linker vowels in compounds, but acceptability improves significantly when the linker is the only vowel in a stem with a falling sonority cluster. Thus, the stress system distinguishes clusters with falling sonority from other types.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001716/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001716<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Accepted to Laboratory Phonology, pending minor revisions</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>russian, compounds, stress, lexical stress, accent, variation, gradience, grammaticality, acceptability, ratings, frequency, onset-sensitive stress, sonority sequencing, stress clash, positive constraints, morphology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001716/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2013]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>921 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001716">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001716">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
