First, they violate the head-initial parameter setting for English phrases. Second, they cannot select complements nor undergo phrasal movement. Third, complements rather than heads receive the main stress in phrases (Nespor and Vogel 1982). But non-emphatic standard stresses in very expensive glasses, fondly described, proudly defiant and directly behind are all on the X0 heads. Fourth, most English “A-ly adverbs” in post-head or other positions alternate with non-parenthetical PP phrases such as in an A way or to an A degree. But many–ly adverbs do not alternate with such PPs. 
This paper argues that these ‘pre-head modifiers’ are in fact themselves heads which are grammatical heads (v, a, p, and n) whose complements are the traditionally termed VP, AP, PP and NP they have previously been thought to modify. The four (or five) problems above disappear. This solution leads to interesting consequences, which the paper briefly addresses,  i.e. –ly is then a late inserted inflectional head of these ‘adverbs’, which are in fact adjuncts of category A located in head positions.
