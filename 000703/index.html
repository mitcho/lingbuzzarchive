Language is an optimal solution to the interface conditions that it must satisfy. One of the issues arising in this framework concerns the nature of language variation, a traditional domain of inquiry in linguistics. In the minimalist perspective, it ends up being considered as a residue, as an imperfection of the optimal system, lying outside Narrow Syntax.

These considerations might be particularly relevant when applied to those categories that are central to the computational system, as for instance the category Tense (T). T plays an important role at both interfaces, triggering agreement with the subject in many languages  at the S-M interface  and being the crucial locus for the temporal interpretation of the utterance  at the C-I interface. In both cases, T functions as a bridge toward the context. 

Typologically, languages differ widely as to the way of expressing temporal relations. Some languages  as for instance Italian and Romanian  have a rich and complex morphological system encoding various temporal relations. Others  such as English  have quite a simpler system, explicitly encoding only a subset of the distinctions encoded in Italian or Romanian. Finally, some languages  such as for instance Chinese  have no temporal morphemes at all. 

Here I will address the question more closely, trying to better define the optimal solution for the temporal interpretation of utterances across languages. I will argue that languages do not differ in encoding reference to indexicality in the Complementizer layer and that  this property might  (partially) motivate the phase status of C.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000703/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000703<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>paper presented at the conference 'Biolinguistics: Language Evolution and Variation'.
