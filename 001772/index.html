Endogenous growth theory has become the consensus explanation of the phenomenon of long-term economic growth.  That theory makes an assumption which is not seen as controversial by economists, namely that the supply of new, unanticipated ideas is limited only by the level of resources committed to idea-generation.  Much linguistic theorizing, on the other hand, assumes that potential human cognitive products are tightly constrained by biology.  Although linguists and economists are primarily interested in different kinds of ‘ideas’, there is a real contradiction between the respective assumptions.  The paper does not offer a resolution of the contradiction, but encourages members of our discipline to be aware of it as a problem needing to be resolved.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001772/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001772<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To be in _Language_</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language universals, biolinguistics, endogenous growth, economics, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>492 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001772">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001772">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
