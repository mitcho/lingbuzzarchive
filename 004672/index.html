After laying out key concepts in this realm, this course introduces students to current questions, including: 

— ‘Collective’ is usually the antonym of `distributive’; but what is it/how is it diagnosed? 

— How should distributivity be represented semantically? 

— Which predicates (verb phrases; adjectives) are understood in which ways, and why? 

— When multiple readings/understandings are available, why do the collective / nondistributive ones seem to be preferred? 


Students are welcomed into an exciting area engaging compositional semantics, lexical semantics, logic, and experimental data.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004672/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004672<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>distributivity, semantics, pragmatics, lexical semantics, plurality, world knowledge, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004672/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>468 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004672">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004672">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
