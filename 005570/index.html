Much work builds on this assumption in studying how the two quantifiers are mentally encoded and processed (Hackl, 2009; Pietroski et al., 2009; Szymanik and Zajenkowski, 2010; Lidz et al., 2011; Steinert-Threlkeld et al., 2015; Talmina et al., 2017). There is however empirical evidence that 'most' is sometimes interpreted as 'significantly more than half' (Ariel, 2003, 2004; Solt, 2011, 2016; Ramotowska et al., 2020). Is this difference between 'most' and 'more than half' a consequence of pragmatic strengthening of 'most', or is the standard assumption that the two quantifiers are truth-conditionally equivalent wrong? We report two experiments which demonstrate that 'most' preserves the 'significantly more than half' interpretation in downward-entailing environments, which speaks against the pragmatic strengthening option and in favor of there being a difference between the two quantifiers at the level of truth conditions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005570/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005570<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Semantics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>quantification, implicatures, experimental semantics, most, more than half, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005570/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>788 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005570">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005570">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
