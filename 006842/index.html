It is
argued that wh&wh coordinations involve derivational coordination formation via sideward merger where the affected elements undergo movement before derivational coordination formation, sideward merger more generally not being allowed directly from interpreted positions, and the derivationally
formed coordination itself undergoes movement upon insertion into the structure. The proposed derivation also captures a clause-mate requirement on elements involved in wh&wh coordinations, the ordering constraints on these elements (which are shown not to track superiority effects with multiple
wh-fronting), and the single-pair reading restriction on wh&wh coordinations. The paper also discusses more general properties (and a typology of) derivational coordination formation and sideward merger in general. The main typological prediction of the paper is that since both multiple wh-fronting and
wh&wh coordinations depend on the availability of an indeterminate system, but in different ways, there should be a good deal of overlap between multiple wh-fronting languages and languages allowing wh&wh coordinations but there should still be languages that allow wh&wh coordinations but not multiple wh-fronting, which is shown to be borne out.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006842/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006842<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms. University of Connecticut</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>coordination, indeterminates, multiple wh-fronting, quantifiers, sideward merger, superiority, typology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006842/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>738 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006842">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006842">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
