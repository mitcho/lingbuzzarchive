This paper argues to treat MS as a grammatical phenomenon, primarily determined by the grammar of a wh-interrogative. I assume that MS and MA answers come from a uniform answerhood (Fox 2013) and attribute the MS/MA ambiguity to structural variations within the question nucleus. The variations are: (i) the scope ambiguity of the higher-order wh-trace, and (ii) the absence/presence of an anti-exhaustification operator. However, treating MS answers as complete answers contradicts the widely adopted analysis of uniqueness effects in questions: according to Dayal 1996, the uniqueness effects of singular which-phrases come from an exhaustivity presupposition that a question must have a unique exhaustive true answer. To solve this dilemma, I propose that question interpretations presuppose ‘Relativized Exhaustivity’, which has an effect of evaluating exhaustivity relative to the accessible worlds as opposed to the anchor world. Relativized Exhaustivity preserves the merits of Dayal’s exhaustivity presupposition while permitting MS; moreover, it explains the local-uniqueness effects in modalized singular wh-questions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005322/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005322<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under revision (Comments welcome!)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>interrogatives, questions, answers, mention-some, uniqueness, exhaustivity, exclusivity, free choice, modality, modal obviation, higher-order interpretations</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005322/v3.pdf">v3 [August 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005322/v2.pdf">v2 [July 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005322/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>800 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005322">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005322">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
