A key empirical observation is that, in a range of languages, a subset of syntactic phenomena are restricted to root contexts (Emonds 1970/1976; Hooper and Thompson 1973). This dissertation proposes a range of empirical diagnostics that demonstrate that Mandarin Chinese syntax is also systematically sensitive to a root/embedded distinction. Data is amassed from the distribution and interpretation of discourse particles, aspect particles, and propositional assertion markers, the scope of question constructions, and topicalisation.
These observations, drawn from a language that has not previously been discussed in the root/embedded debate, have some important theoretical consequences. First the data suggests that root/embedded does not constitute a binary distinction as traditionally assumed, but rather a ‘continuum’. I argue that present theories, which rely on some notion of structural truncation of embedded CPs, cannot account for this. Instead, I argue (in the spirit of Aboh 2005 on Gungbe; Krapova 2010 on Bulgarian; Haegeman 2009, 2011 and Haegeman and Ürögdi 2010 on English) that any restrictions on the occurrence of movement phenomena in embedded contexts derive from general principles of locality and intervention following the derivation and consequent interaction of moved constituents.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001894/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001894<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Cambirdge</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>root syntax, embedded clause, mandarin, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1172 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001894">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001894">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
