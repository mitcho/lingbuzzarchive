This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap. The participants were three groups of adult Chinese college students who had difficulties in perceiving and producing English/θ/-/s/ and/ð/-/z/. Group 1 and Group 2 were exposed to a perception-based and a production-based training approach respectively. Group 3 was the control group (no training). The training materials were “minimal pairs” embedding the target contrasts in various phonetic environments. Each session included explicit articulatory instructions and perception- or production-based prac-tice activities. Individual participants’ perception and production of the target contrasts were tested before (pretest), after (posttest), and one month after the training programme (delayed posttest). According to the results, (1) in comparison with the pretest, both the perception- and produc-tion-based groups showed significant perception and production improve-ment in the posttest, which remained in the delayed posttest; the control group had no significant perception or production changes across the three tests; (2) the production-based group had significantly better perception and production performance than the perception-based group both in the postt-est and the delayed posttest. The overall results suggest that a production- based approach may be optimal for L2 sounds learning.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007740/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007740<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>LANGUAGE LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>speech perception, speech production, sla, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>321 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007740">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007740">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
