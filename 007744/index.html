One of these major questions is what mechanisms are responsible for generating the structures that comply with the restrictions
imposed by phrasal lexicalisation. Starke’s (2018) answer to this question was the lexicalisation algorithm. The lexicalisation algorithm was introduced as a simple, constrained and algorithmic process of externalization of syntactic structures. It takes the universal syntactic hierarchy or functional sequence (fseq) as an input and produces language-particular outputs due to its
interaction with two other components of the grammar: the postsyntactic lexicon on the one hand and the syntactic derivation on the other hand. In effect, the algorithm steers the derivation in such a way that language-particular structures are formed as a function of language-particular
lexicons. Work since 2018 has been marked by two important evolutions. The first of these is the realization that lexicalisation is not only affected by the size of lexical entries, but also by their structural shape. Two lexical entries of the same size may give rise to different patterns of lexicalisation by organising the same projections into different structures. The second innovation is more fundamental, in that it involves a change to the formulation of the Lexicalisation Algorithm itself. This paper introduces the algorithm and
summarizes the results of recent studies that discuss the algorithm, explores its predictions and consequences, as well as proposed modifications to it.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007744/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007744<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review, first chapter in "Nanosyntax and the Lexicalisation Algorithm", edited by Pavel Caha, Karen De Clercq and Guido Vanden Wyngaerd</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>nanosyntax, state of the art, phrasal lexicalisation, lexicalisation algorithm, subextraction, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007744/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2023]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>776 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007744">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007744">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
