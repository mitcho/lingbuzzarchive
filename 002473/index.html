This paper provides support for this general picture by presenting parsing evidence for the intermediate traces created by successive-cyclic movement. It furthermore uses this parsing evidence to investigate the distribution of these intermediate traces. The central findings of this paper are (i) that successive-cyclic movement targets the edge of finite clauses and (ii) that no intermediate landing sites exist at the edges of (extended) VPs. These conclusions are fully consistent with traditional characterizations of successive-cyclicity but at variance with more recent approaches that hold that even movement within a single clause is successive-cyclic. A reassessment of arguments put forth in support of the latter hypothesis reveals them to be less compelling than they are standardly taken to be, which provides converging evidence for the parsing conclusions reached here. More generally, because successive cyclicity is the result of general syntactic locality domains, this paper provides psycholinguistic evidence for such locality domains and for their distribution.
