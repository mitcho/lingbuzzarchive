A fundamental process and result of contact-induced language change is borrowing. This has rightly been considered one of the principal sources of language change, along with sound change and analogy and consequently it plays a decisive role in the field of contact linguistics. The Romance languages have the potential to contribute substantially to this area of investigation, since they have a wide geospatial distribution, a long history of contact with several typologically diverse languages, and are abundantly documented. However, this great potential has remained largely unexploited in one main respect: the Romance data have not been used in their entirety to test theories of contact-induced language change and in particular borrowing. The present chapter takes up this challenge and, by drawing on empirical evidence from a broad range of Romance varieties, aims to outline contact-induced grammatical change and provide a critical assessment of the state-of-the-art in research on borrowing as a key mechanism of contact-induced language change and variation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005539/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005539<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>accepted for publication in: Adam Ledgeway & Martin Maiden (eds), The Cambridge handbook of Romance linguistics (CHRLing).
