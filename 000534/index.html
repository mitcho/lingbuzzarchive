In spite of the difficulties of the various (phonological, morphological, lexical, and semantic) definitions of word, Bloomfields characterization of minimum free forms is applied to designate items at the top of the hierarchy, which are called autonomous words. Bound forms that allow autonomous words to occur between them and the lexical item they are bound to are dependent words. The novelty of this paper lies in dividing the rest of the lexical items 'below', i.e., nonwords, into three groups: semiwords, affixoids, and affixes, based on a new application of a familiar operation, coordination reduction, which is shown to work both backward and forward for some items, but only backward reduction is possible for others.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000534/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000534<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Acta Linguistica Hungarica</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>free / bound form, coordination reduction, backward / forward deletion, compounding, binary / n-ary coordination, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>294 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000534">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000534">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
