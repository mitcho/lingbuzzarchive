The work is co-authored and edited by Hans Broekhuis. The aim of this publication is to present a synthesis of the available knowledge of Dutch syntax. It is primarily concerned with language description and not with linguistic theory, providing support to all researchers of language and linguistics, including advanced students. The first two volumes in this series, "Nouns and Noun Phrases", were published in 2012 (see lingbuzz/001638) and are now also available as open access publication at Oapen.org. A new volume, "Adjectives and Adjective phrases", appears in March/April 2013. It discusses the internal make-up as well as the distribution of adjective phrases. Topics that will be covered include: complementation and modification of adjective phrases; comparative and superlative formation, and the syntactic uses of adjective phrases. Special attention is paid to the so-called partitive genitive construction and the adverbial use of past/passive participles and infinitives. The downloadable file contains a TOC, as well as a sample chapter (ch.7: The partitive genitive construction).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001762/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001762<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Amsterdam University Press (hardcover) and University of Chicago Press (press.uchicago.edu); also available as Open Access publication at oapen.org</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dutch, adjectives, partitive genitive, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001762/v2.pdf">v2 [December 2013]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001762/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2013]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1991 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001762">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001762">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
