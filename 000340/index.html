The starting point will be the consideration that the subjunctive plays a characteristic role in sequence of tense phenomena. Languages that show the Double Access Reading  henceforth, DAR  with the indicative, in general do not exhibit it with the subjunctive.

In this work Ill discuss the syntax associated with subjunctive  in particular, the syntax of the CP layer  and show that in DAR languages its properties systematically correlate with the temporal interpretation assigned to the embedded clause. I propose, following ideas by Giorgi and Pianesi (1997, 2004a), that this pattern can be explained by means of the following hypothesis: the CP layer, when the embedded clause has a DAR interpretation, contains a projection that is read off at the interface as pointing to the speakers (temporal and spatial) coordinate. In the other, non-DAR, cases such a projection is absent and therefore the speakers coordinate doesnt intervene in the temporal interpretation of the embedded clause.

Even if this suggestion cannot explain the whole of the subjunctive phenomena, it nevertheless opens the way to a better understanding of some empirical observations. The following generalizations will be shown to hold: In DAR languages, the contexts where the speakers coordinate must always be represented, are the indicative ones. The contexts where it must not be represented, are the contexts where a subjunctive verbal form must appear. This proposal is based on the analysis of contexts where the speakers coordinate can be present, but must not, which exhibit a peculiar syntax and a corresponding peculiar semantics.

This analysis has the advantage of permitting a natural distinction between the so-called subjunctive in DAR languages and the apparently corresponding mood found in non-DAR languages. The sets of so-called subjunctive phenomena in the two language groups present systematic differences, which can appear in a different light, once connected to the syntax and semantics of the CP layer as analyzed here.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000340/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000340<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Preliminary version, to appear with the title: "Toward a Syntax of the Subjunctive Mood" in a monographic issue of Lingua on Mood, J.Quer (Ed.).</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>subjunctive, complementizer deletion, speaker, indexicality, sequence of tense, left periphery, split-c, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000340/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2005]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2883 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000340">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000340">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
