First, we show that bias meanings arising from these questions are best characterized by the notion of contextual bias rather than the speaker’s bias, and we provide a formal definition that unifies contextual bias from different sources based on the subjective probability distribution and the Table model (Farkas & Bruce 2010). Second, we provide a compositional semantic analysis of each polar question. The three questions all denote an update of the Table with a Hamblin-set. The difference
between positive and negative ma questions is attributed to the pragmatic competition. An A-not-A question is different from a ma question in that the former is uttered with the low boundary tone L% that gives rise to an exhaustivity meaning, which in turn is responsible for its unbiased connotation. Our analysis further explains what kinds of answers are possible as responses to these questions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006208/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006208<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>polar questions; contextual bias; subjective probability; table, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>243 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006208">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006208">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
