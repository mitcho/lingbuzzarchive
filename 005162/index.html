The project involves the nature of kind reference, as well as the implications of number marking on the semantics of counting and a little-understood element of counting expressions, i.e., optional numeral classifiers.

The analyses to be presented in this dissertation explain the English and Turkish data in a comparative and mostly unified way, as well as offering novel insights into the variations between the two. In the semantics of number marking, the main contribution that I make concerns the semantics of kind reference, the effects of which are revealed more significantly in Turkish than in English, extending to phenomena that pertain to naming kinds and pseudo-incorporation. The findings are also interpreted with respect to the semantics of counting, the nature of which is elucidated by the analysis of optional classifiers. The investigation of Western Armenian and Persian reveals striking similarities between these languages and Turkish, which provides cross-linguistic support for my claims regarding the semantics of number marking and kind reference, as well as counting and the optional classifier system.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005162/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005162<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>2019</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>number marking/bare noun semantics, singular and plural kind reference, pseudo-incorporation, counting expressions, optional classifiers, definiteness/indefiniteness, turkish, english, western armenian, persian</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005162/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>148 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005162">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005162">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
