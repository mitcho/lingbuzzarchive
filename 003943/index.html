The answer is rooted in the computational framework of subregular complexity, which has already been fruitfully applied to phonology. The computational perspective reveals that Merge belongs to the class TSL (tier-based strictly local) if the grammar also allows for recursive adjunction. Any cognitive device that can handle this level of computational complexity also possesses all the resources that are needed for Move. In fact, Merge and Move are remarkably similar when viewed as instances of TSL. Consequently, Move has no additional computational or conceptual cost attached to it and comes essentially for free.

I am currently working on an expanded, more accessible version that is to be submitted to a journal. All feedback on the proceedings version is greatly appreciated.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003943/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003943<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of CLS 2017</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>move, adjunction, minimalist grammars, subregular complexity, tier-based strictly local, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003943/v2.pdf">v2 [April 2018]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003943/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>585 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003943">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003943">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
