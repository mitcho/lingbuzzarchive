When the verb is
negated, GN is realized on an object that would otherwise be realized as
accusative. We demonstrate that Lithuanian GN is a syntactic (in line with
Arkadiev 2016) and morphological phenomenon in contrast to Russian GN,
whose realization is influenced by semantic factors (e.g., Kagan 2013). It
differs from Russian (Pesetsky 1982) in that (i) it is always assigned to a
DP which would otherwise bear structural accusative regardless of its semantic properties, (ii) it cannot affect a structural nominative DP regardless
of whether it is an external or internal argument. Lithuanian GN in this
respect is similar to Polish GN (e.g., Przepiórkowski 2000, Witkos 2008). We offer a three-layered approach to case arguing that GN is a reflection of
structural object case, assigned in syntax, then translated to morphological
genitive case at PF and, finally, realized at Vocabulary Insertion (Halle &
Marantz, 1993). Thus, structural object case has two morphological realizations: as genitive under negation, or as accusative in the absence of negation.
Lithuanian also exhibits long-distance GN (Arkadiev 2016), showing that
case boundaries can cross non-finite clauses without an overt CP element,
suggesting these are not phases.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007564/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007564<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Linguistics (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022226723000130)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>genitive of negation, lithuanian, syntax, morphology, case, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>262 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007564">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007564">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
