The divergent frameworks have made some of this literature hard to access. This paper provides a nontechnical overview of the most important kinds of phenomena in the world’s languages and offers a coherent conceptual frame- work and a set of cross-linguistically applicable technical terms, defined also in an appendix. I also explain other widely used terms that do not form part of the present conceptual system (defined in another appendix). The paper begins with a definition of the most basic term (reflexive construction) and then moves to types of reflexivizers (reflexive pronouns and reflexive voice markers), as well as syntac- tic concepts such as ranks and domains. I also briefly discuss obviative anaphoric pronouns and antireflexive marking. Finally, I introduce the distinction between discourse-referential and co-varying coreference. The general philosophy is that we will understand general questions about reflexive constructions (i.e. questions not restricted to the language-particular level) only when we know what is univer- sal and what is historically accidental, so there is also an appendix that lists some possible universals of reflexive constructions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007470/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007470<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In: Reflexive constructions in the world's languages, ed. by Katarzyna Janic, Nicoletta Puddu, and Martin Haspelmath.
