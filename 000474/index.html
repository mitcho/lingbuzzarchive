The Scandinavian languages have figured rather prominently in the study of that-trace effects, and have played an important role in the theoretical implementation of them. In this paper I will provide an overview of the Scandinavian languages to show the vast differences between and within the languages. It will be shown that some varieties of Norwegian are very liberal, whereas others pattern more or less as English. These differences will receive a straightforward analysis when we assume that the structural position of the complementizers varies across varieties, that is, they lexicalize different heads. Thus that-trace variation is really nothing but a lexicalization difference. This conclusion also accounts for differences related to sub-extraction from subjects vs. extraction of subjects in Norwegian.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000474/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000474<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Working Papers in Scandinavian Syntax 79 (June 2007), 47-73</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>complementizers, extraction, freezing, that-t, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>184 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000474">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000474">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
