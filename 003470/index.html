A blurb follows.)

This book uses mathematical models of language to explain why there are certain gaps in language: things that we might expect to be able to say but can't. For instance, why can we say "I ran for five minutes" but not "*I ran to the store for five minutes"? Why is "five pounds of books" acceptable, but "*five pounds of book" not acceptable? What prevents us from saying "*sixty degrees of water" to express the temperature of the water in a swimming pool when "sixty inches of water" can express its depth? And why can we not say "*all the ants in my kitchen are numerous"? The constraints on these constructions involve concepts that are generally studied separately: aspect, plural and mass reference, measurement, and distributivity. In this book, Lucas Champollion provides a unified perspective on these domains, connects them formally within the framework of algebraic semantics and mereology, and uses this connection to transfer insights across unrelated bodies of literature and formulate a single constraint that explains each of the judgments above.
