ness and scalar adjectives of the absolute lexical class (ex. bald, empty,
straight etc.). The first puzzle concerns the proper analysis of the
relationship between contextual effects associated with absolute ad-
jectives and those associated with relative adjectives like tall, long or
expensive. The dominant view in philosophy is that tall and bald are
both vague constituents. However, an emerging view in linguistics is
that the context-sensitivity exhibited by bald is not due to vagueness
but a different phenomenon: imprecision (cf. Kennedy (2007)). I ar-
gue that the properties of both tall and bald that appear to challenge
our classical semantic theories are symptoms of a single phenomenon:
vagueness. I provide a unified analysis of these properties that ac-
counts for Kennedy’s data using Cobreros, Égré, Ripley, and van Rooij
(2010)’s Tolerant, Classical, Strict (TCS) non-classical logical frame-
work. The second puzzle is the puzzle of the gradability of absolute
adjectives. It has been observed that these constituents seem to have a
non-context-sensitive meaning. However, on the other hand, they are
clearly gradable (John is balder than Peter). I show how, using TCS,
we can preserve the the empirical benefits of the proposal that these
adjectives have absolute semantics, while constructing the pragmatic
scales associated with them using methods in the same vein as van
Benthem (1982) and van Rooij (2011a).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001386/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001386<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Denis Paperno (editor).
