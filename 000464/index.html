Recent work argues that all generative processes, including derivational morphology, can be accomplished syntactically, the SINGLE ENGINE HYPOTHESIS (Marantz, 2001).

In Chapter 1, I introduce the most recent work within DM which adopts and adapts Chomskys DERIVATION BY PHASE HYPOTHESIS to lexical-category formation. I then reanalyze some important and well-known data of Aronoff (1976) in order to show that the single engine hypothesis is motivated and explanatory.

Chapter 2 focuses on verbs from a common root that alternate in transitivity and the role of this non-root morphology. I then propose an analysis of two types of common deverbal nominalizations in Japanese. I argue that, actually, only one of the two types is deverbal; the other type is root-derived. Those root-derived nominalizations that contain apparent verbal transitivity markers seem to raise a paradox for the single engine hypothesis. I resolve it by adopting a proposal of den Dikken (1995)s; such morphology in both verbs and nouns are AFFIXAL PARTICLES. 

Chapter 3 concentrates on lexical causatives in Japanese. There is a widely-held view among linguists (Harley, 1995, 1996, Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 1995, Pinker, 1989, among many), that a lexical causative cannot be derived from a verb which has an agentive subject. Using observations of Matsumoto (1996) and data from idioms in Japanese I argue that no such semantic criterion applies in Japanese. Given the proper pragmatic reading, all verbs, including those with agentive subjects can have a mono-clausal lexical causative partner. This seemingly unique characteristic of Japanese is argued to be directly related to the fact that apparent adicity markers in Japanese are affixal particles as argued in Chapter 2.

Chapter 4 concludes with a brief comparison of transitivity marking in Turkish and Korean with Japanese. I argue that the differences support the affixal particle analysis for Japanese. The analysis also raises the issue about the direction of grammaticalization of the morphology found in alternating verbs. With Roberts and Roussou (2003)s work on grammaticalizations as background, this issue is discussed.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000464/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000464<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ph.D. dissertation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dm, nominalizations, affixal particles, japanese, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2593 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000464">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000464">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
