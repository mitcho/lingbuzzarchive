challenge the standard views of the related core issues, as well as those that are technically difficult to capture under standard compositional semantics. It begins by re-examining several fundamental issues, such as what a question denotes, how a question is composed, and what a wh-item denotes. It then tackles questions with complex structures, including mention-some questions, multi-wh questions, and questions with quantifiers. It also explores several popular issues, such as variations of exhaustivity, sensitivity to false answers, and quantificational variability effects.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003360/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003360<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ph.D Dissertation, Harvard University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>questions, categorial approach, mention-some, multi-wh, quantifying into questions, attitudes, mandarin 'dou', alternative semantics, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1898 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003360">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003360">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
