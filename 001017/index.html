This proposal is not compatible with the DP Hypothesis, where determiners are heads (zero-level). In this paper, I argue for a Simple D approach, where the numeral ("three") and the NP ("books") form a constituent to the exclusion of "more than". Most of the arguments provided target the most essential difference between the two approaches: in Simple D, the numeral and the NP are sisters, and in Complex D the string "more than" and the numeral form a constituent to the exclusion of NP. In several of the languages discussed here (English, Spanish, Russian, Hebrew and Basque) different syntactic and morphophonological flags of the sisterhood relation between the numeral and the NP in simple numeral DPs ("three books") are present in the corresponding comparative numeral constructions, thereby providing evidence that this sisterhood relation, undisputed in the former construction, is present in the latter as well. The paper also includes discussion of comparative numerals in Korean and Greek, which have certain properties that pose a challenge to Simple D. Specific analyses for these languages are proposed that do not follow the details of the Simple D approach but in which the basic insight that there are no complex determiners is preserved.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001017/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001017<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in NELS 40: Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the North East Linguistic Society</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>numerals, comparatives, dp hypothesis, syntax, spanish, basque, english, hebrew, korean, russian, greek</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>693 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001017">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001017">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
