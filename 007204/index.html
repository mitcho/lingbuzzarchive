It is shown that neither a scrambling analysis nor an analysis where the two orders are not derivationally related is fully satisfactory. The former faces problems with contexts where object order is restricted (causative and benefactive readings, verb sensitivity, and idiomatic readings), while the latter faces issues with explaining quantifier scope asymmetries while also introducing a lot of redundancy into the analysis that is not reflected in the cross-linguistically attested ditransitive case patterns. The proposed solution builds on the approach to projection of Chomsky (2013, 2015). The key is that when second object merges with a VP, it creates an ambiguous labeling scenario ({NP,VP}), which I argue has two equivalent resolutions: (i) movement of the VP with the first object inside (Kayne 2005; Collins 2021), or (ii) movement of the second object. This crucially derives both free object order in the general case and the restrictions on object order in select contexts, as due to the specifics of the VP-movement analysis it is possible for selectional restrictions to filter out either derivation (i) or (ii). Additionally, it is shown that the proposed analysis can be straightforwardly extended to the English dative alternation and Romance ditransitives, with some interesting implications for the analysis of cross-linguistic variation in ditransitive constructions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007204/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007204<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>applicatives, benefactives, binding asymmetries, case, causatives, dative alternation, ditransitives, idioms, labeling algorithm, passivization, quantifier scope, scrambling, slovenian, smuggling, word order, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>367 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007204">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007204">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
