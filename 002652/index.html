The empirically observed cycle is as follows. It starts with grammar (a) where only one form X is used both for progressive and imperfective meanings. Then in (b), an optional progressive marker Y is innovated; in (c), Y becomes the obligatory marker for progressive meanings, while X still marks the imperfective. At the final stage (d), old form X dies out altogether, and Y expresses both the imperfective and the progressive. Deo’s original model, though reaching (d) from (a), does not predict that either (b) or (c) is learned by all speakers in the community. This paper improves on that result. I show that it is not possible to get exactly the expected sequence (a)→(b)→(c)→(d), but we can approach it better than the original analysis. The outcomes we get are: (i) (b) is never spoken by all speakers; (ii) (b) and (c) are spoken by all, but (d) is not reached; (iii) all four stages occur, but back-shifts such as (c)→(b) also appear. At the moment, there are no empirical data of sufficient temporal granularity to either support or falsify predictions (ii) and (iii). This highlights the value of explicit evolutionary modeling of meaning change: through evolutionary analysis we show that Deo’s theory of the progressive-imperfective cycle makes a novel and unexpected, but practically testable empirical prediction.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002652/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002652<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantic change, evolutionary game theory, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002652/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1418 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002652">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002652">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
