Specifically, Chomsky (2019b, c) claims that RR includes both minimal search and the Phase Impenetrability Condition (PIC) and Chomsky, Gallego, and Ott (2019) suggest that the principle of Determinacy applies at the output of MERGE. This paper indicates potential conceptual flaws in Chomsky (2019a, b, c) and Chomsky, Gallego, and Ott (2019), and proposes that RR only include the PIC and the principle of Determinacy apply at the input of MERGE, thereby overcoming the flaws. The proposed theory is also empirically superior in that it provides a unified, principled account of various movement restrictions on different languages, which have been explained by different constraints or principles: the subject condition, verb particle constructions, the specificity effects, no vacuous topicalization, the non-existence of complementizer-less subject relatives, the that-trace effects, the freezing effects with topics, further raising, Merge-over-Move, island violation repairs by ellipsis and pronouns, no superfluous steps in a derivation, and the anti-locality effects.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004108/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004108<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Unpublished manuscript, Toyo University and Meiji University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>(capital) merge, workspace, determinacy, the subject condition, the specificity effect, the that-trace effects, no vacuous topicalization, non-existence of complementizer-less subject relatives, freezing effects with topics, merge-over-move, further raising, island violation repairs, no superfluous steps in a derivation, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004108/v3.pdf">v3 [September 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004108/v2.pdf">v2 [March 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004108/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1617 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004108">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004108">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
