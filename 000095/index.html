For example, give, but not donate or wash, is used in the double-object construction: I gave/*donated/*washed Mary a car. The contrast has been attributed in part to morphophonological properties, like the Latinate form of donate, and in part to semantic properties, like the fact that wash does not imply a transfer of possession (Oehrle 1976). In this paper, I propose that another constraint on verb distribution, the Target/Subject Matter (T/SM) restriction (Pesetsky 1995), also arises from a combination of morphological and semantic factors. I argue that semantic selectional restrictions rule out certain derivations that would give rise to a T/SM violation, while morphological selectional restrictions guide the pronunciation of the well-formed derivations. This conclusion supports the position of Distributed Morphology that semantic, but not morphological information is available during the syntactic derivation (Halle & Marantz 1993).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000095/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000095<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dm, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>702 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000095">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000095">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
