Baker (2008) proposes that this has a universal structural explanation: the subject of adjectival or nominal predication does not merge directly with an adjectival or nominal head, but instead with a higher head Pred. The lack of person agreement on non-verbs emerges when that structural assumption is combined with the Structural Condition on Person Agreement (SCOPA), which bans 1st/2nd person agreement on a head if the bearer of those features does not merge with that head. This paper presents data from original fieldwork on Koryak (Chukotko-Kamchatkan) that challenges SCOPA, as predicative nouns and adjectives (among others) in this language do show covarying person morphology. This paper argues, however, that in Koryak, Pred itself bears uninterpretable phi-features. Once it has agreed with the subject of predication, these features spread to Pred's complement by a highly typologically unusual process of person concord, thus defusing a possible counterexample to Baker's theory.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005686/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005686<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of WCCFL 38</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agreement, concord, predication, scopa, koryak, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>289 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005686">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005686">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
