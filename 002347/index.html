Kager (2012) shows that the pathology is an unavoidable prediction of analyses employing contextual lapse constraints (e.g. *ExtLapseR; no 000 strings at the right edge), and argues that the only way to avoid it is to eliminate these constraints in favor of weakly layered feet. I argue instead that systems exhibiting the midpoint pathology are unattested not because the constraints that would generate them are absent from Con, but because the necessary ranking is difficult to learn. This proposal has implications for metrical theory, and phonological theory more generally. If the absence of midpoint systems can be attributed to a learning difficulty, there is no need to eliminate contextual lapse constraints from Con, and Kager's (2012) argument for the necessity of weakly layered feet does not hold. More broadly, these results support the view that typology is shaped and limited by considerations of learnability (Boersma 2003, Alderete 2008, Staubs 2014). When evaluating the factorial typology of a constraint set, it is important to consider not only what is predicted to be a possible language, but also what can be learned reliably.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002347/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002347<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Language 92.4, 753-791.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>stress, typology, learnability, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002347/v3.pdf">v3 [August 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002347/v2.pdf">v2 [December 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002347/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2741 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002347">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002347">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
