resumption  as  found  in  long  distance  relativization  in  Swiss  German  have  a common  core:  Both  involve  long-distance  movement  of  a  sentence/aboutness 
topic. We present independent evidence that long-distance A’-movement is only 
available for potentially contrastive elements, i.e. elements whose denotation is 
a member of a set of potential alternatives. Sentence topics do not qualify as contrastive in this sense and are therefore incompatible with long A’-movement; we 
argue that this would instantiate a kind of Improper Movement. We posit that wh-
phrases are syntactically decomposed with the operator being directly inserted 
into the matrix scope position while the restriction originates in the theta-posi-
tion and undergoes long A’-movement into the matrix clause to amalgamate with 
the operator at PF. The ban on long movement of the sentence topic is argued 
to follow from the fact that intermediate complementizers bear a feature uCon-
trast that can only be valued if a potentially contrastive element moves through 
its specifier. The fact that that-trace effects have usually been related to subject-hood is largely due to the fact that subjects are the default (sentence) topic, but data from German show that the same effect obtains if a non-subject functioning as the sentence topic undergoes long A’-movement. Languages have various strategies to cope with this problem: In both languages, long subject extraction becomes acceptable once some other constituent functions as the sentence topic. The Adverb Effect illustrates this for English. German with its free word order in the middle field offers a host of possibilities in this respect, which is why the degradedness of subject extraction is much less visible than in English. In long relativization in Swiss German long topic movement is avoided by means of a repair: The construction involves base-generation where the restriction is realized by means of a resumptive pronoun. This makes movement of the restriction unnecessary so that no Improper Movement obtains.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002831/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002831<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In Patrick Brandt & Eric Fuß (eds.): Repairs.
