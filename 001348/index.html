Genitive-subject clauses, previously analyzed as a manifestation of Genitive/Nominative subject conversion phenomenon in the syntactic literature, are analyzed as exceptionally case marked subjects of clauses that lack the nominative-case licensing feature, similar to the well studied accusative-subject clauses that lack tense. Genitive is licensed by the phi features of a nominal functional category external to the clause in Turkish, as suggested for other languages (Miyagawa 1993, Krause 2001, among others).  The difference between genitive and accusative case licensing is restricted to the nature of the functional category that licenses subject case, which is nominal in the former and verbal in the latter. The syntactic mechanism involved in case licensing is language and/or structure dependent. The major theoretical implications of the proposed analysis are the following: de-coupling of case-agreement and motivating covert movement as a syntactic process along with Agree and Move. Theoretically, phi features are accepted to be uninterpretable features on Tense head, which are involved in subject case licensing through motivating the movement of the subject DP to Spec TP. In previous literature on Turkish (Kornfilt 1984, 1987, 1988, 2002, 2003) and European Portuguese (Raposo 1987, 1989), agreement is accepted to be the licensing head or feature for genitive case on subjects in subordinate contexts and for nominative subjects in matrix clauses (Kornfilt 1987, 1989).  This research maintains the idea that agreement is involved in genitive subject case licensing but argues that clause external rather than clause internal agreement is the key to understanding the syntactic mechanism involved.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001348/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001348<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>California Linguistic Notes XXXII Spring, 1-39 2007</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>generative syntax, mp, case, agreement, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>113 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001348">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001348">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
