In unmarked questions it is cliticized to the fronted finite verb or auxiliary, which has been described as head-movement to C, with ko a spell-out of Q-marked C. Questions with a narrowly focused constituent present a problem for this analysis. The narrowly focused constituent is fronted, pied-piping as much as is necessary. The clitic ko can be cliticized to the entire fronted constituent, but can alternatively be cliticized to a subconstituent of it, and not necessarily to the actually focused category. The rule is that the clitic must c-command the focused category. The same rule holds for the focus particle kin too, even. The initially appealing idea that the question clitic ko is syntactically equal to the focus  clitic kin plus a WH-feature is shown to be empirically untenable. Instead, ko has a more restricted syntactic distribution than kin, always (first-)merging with the maximal DP containing Focus, except optionally below a demonstrative, while kin can merge with any subconstituent of the DP. As focus-particles, what they have in common is that they probe for a Focus-feature. But ko also enters a relation (as a goal) with uWH-marked C, and undergoes wh-movement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000596/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000596<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>question, focus, clitic, finnish, wh, agree, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>992 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000596">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000596">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
