It is argued that the semantic effects of prefixes, their morpho-syntactic behavior and the asymmetries between the so-called external and internal prefixes are best captured by an analysis based on multiple relativization. A counterpart of the raising analysis of multiple relatives is formulated in the verbal domain, where aspectual relative clauses modify the highest aspectual head, and head movement of the aspect head triggers agreement between the bounder (PP specifying the bounds that induce telicity) and the lexical verb that head moves. This agreement is marked by prefixes, which therefore correspond to the respective prepositions. The analysis has a wider empirical coverage than its predecessors, but it also contributes to some more general theoretical claims: that all the type recursion in language stems from relativization, that relativization is a general syntactic strategy which parametrically occurs in different categorial domains, and that lexical verbs, just like lexical nouns (hence open classes in general) do not take complements.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001329/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001329<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>manuscript</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>verb prefixation, aspect, operator movement, multiple relativization, agreement, slavic, serbo-croatian, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>545 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001329">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001329">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
