It gives examples of several semantic and positional types of clitics from a wide range of languages, and it discusses some typical phonological effects associated with clitics. In the proposed definition, the crucial contrast between affixes and clitics is that affixes are class-selective (occurring always on nouns, on verbs, or on adjectives), while clitics are do not exhibit word-class selectivity. In the stereotypical view of clitics, they are “prosodically deficient” in some way, but the phonological effects are quite diverse and cannot serve as a basis for a definition. As clitics are defined as kinds of minimal forms (or morphs), they cannot be nonsegmental, and they cannot “interrupt” another minimal form (so that there cannot be endoclitics by definition). Finally, I note that the object person indexes of the Romance languages, which have very often been called “clitics”, are actually affixes in the modern languages, although they must go back to earlier clitics.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007071/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007071<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Typology at the Crossroads 3(2).1-59 (open access)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>clitic, affix, comparative concept, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007071/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>780 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007071">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007071">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
