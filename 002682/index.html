Beyond theoretical economy, the motivation for this enterprise is based on crosslinguistic evidence showing a unique term for 'same' through all constructions in many unrelated languages. The proposed analysis does not resort to any specific mechanism, but relates 'sidi' terms to both comparatives and relational terms: 'sidi' terms are assumed to be relational adjectives that are complemented by DPs or comparative clauses; in short, they are analyzed as comparatives of individuals. The diversity of constructions does not derive from multiple lexical entries, but from the presence of silent structures: in particular, the comparative clause can be fully or partially elided, and the phrasal or clausal complement of 'sidi' terms can include a silent underspecified pronoun, which can get a pronominal, reflexive, reciprocal or vaguer interpretation. The behavior of 'sidi' terms in islands argues for the presence of silent structures.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002682/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002682<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Lingua 156 (2015)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>same/different/other, comparative, relational term, ellipsis, underspecified pronoun, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1442 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002682">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002682">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
