zero-change (or failed-attempt) use of causative predicates is easier to obtain with
agent subjects than with causer subjects. The paper is structured as follows. Section
2 reports experimental studies suggesting that the degree of acceptance of the
zero-change at study varies across languages and across types of causative verbs,
focusing on Mandarin run-of-the-mill (extensional) monomorphemic causative
verbs on one hand, and French and English defeasible (modal) causative predicates
on the other. This difference is accounted for in section 7. Section 3 identifies
the source of the zero-change uses for these two sets of languages, namely outer
aspect for Mandarin extensional causatives, and sublexical modality for English or
French defeasible causatives. Section 4 spells out an issue raised by Martin’s (2015)
account of the link between agentivity and non-culmination. Section 5 shows
how the Voice head introducing agents vs. causers combines with causative vps,
and how the semantic difference between these two voice heads infuences the
interpretation of the vp-event, and, in particular, the way the causing event type
denoted by the VP is tokenized. More precisely, it is argued that in the agentive
use, the causative event type denoted by the VP is ‘fleshed out’ by complex events
composed of an action of x and a change-of-state  of the theme’s referent
y, whereas in the non-agentive use, the very same causing event type is fleshed
out by changes-of-state of the theme’s referent only, themselves caused by the
eventuality denoted by the subject. On this view, if we abstract away from the
external argument, a non-agentive causative VP is interpreted the same way as its
anticausative counterpart. It is then argued that the semantic difference between the
two Voice heads ultimately explains why typically, zero-change uses of causative VPs are acceptable with agents only, starting with extensional causative verbs in
section 6.1, and then addressing defeasible (modal) causative verbs in section 6.2.
Section 8 accounts for why the zero-change reading is occasionally accepted by
some speakers even with a causer subject.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004667/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004667<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Bar-Asher Siegal, Elitzur and Boneh, Nora (editors), Perspectives on Causation.
