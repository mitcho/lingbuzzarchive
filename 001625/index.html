Given that the utterance must be interpreted and pronounced, its syntactic representation – the only level of representation admitted in a minimalist framework – must interface with the sensorimotor (SM) system on one side, and the cognitive–intentional (CI) one on the other. In the minimalist spirit, the utterance must also be exhaustively represented. Namely, we cannot expect a deus ex machina to provide further information in order to obtain the correct phonology and meaning.
The question I will consider is therefore the following: Which are the formatives that must be present in the syntax for the sensorimotor and the cognitive-intentional interfaces to solve their puzzle? My hypothesis here is that syntax is richer than previously thought, in that it also contains information usually considered as belonging to other levels of representation. 
To make this point, I consider two kinds of parentheticals, the one introducing Quotations (QU) and the one introducing Free Indirect Discourse (FID). Their analysis might shed light on the structure of the so-called left periphery of the clause, explaining also some phenomena still unaccounted for in previous literature. 
I adopt Kayne’s (1994) view that linear order is derived from hierarchical properties, namely, that linear precedence reflects asymmetric c-command. Hence I propose that the pause, or the Comma, is a head, K, and projects its own constituent. Since there are two intonational breaks, there are two heads K, the higher one taking the parenthetical as its complement and the lower one taking the host sentence as its. The notion of complement here is to be understood purely in structural terms, and not in lexical ones.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001625/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001625<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>parentheticals, free indirect discourse, interfaces, linearization, quotations, indexicals, comma intonation, semantics, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001625/v3.pdf">v3 [October 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001625/v2.pdf">v2 [October 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001625/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2012]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1562 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001625">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001625">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
