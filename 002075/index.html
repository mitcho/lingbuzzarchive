However, it is not always easy for non-sinologist researchers to obtain comprehensive answers to their questions raised by statements encountered in the literature, which often present Chinese as a somewhat “exotic” language radically different from the Indo-European languages most linguists are familiar with. The proposed book aims at demystifying Chinese. It places controversial issues within the larger context of current syntactic theories, offers precise analyses and points out the untenability of the preconceived ideas prevalent in the literature. A large array of representative data is provided in order to enable the reader to judge for her/himself the competing viewpoints, which are often based on insufficient data sets.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002075/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002075<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>This is the first draft of the book manuscript submitted to De Gruyter Mouton.
