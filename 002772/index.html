Both outside negation and subjective epistemic modals resist embedding under veridicals, semi-factives and proffering predicates, induce Epistemic Containment, and exhibit further peculiar scope-freezing effects. We argue that these phenomena can be given a unified treatment in terms of the scopal properties of subjective epistemic attitudes, once it is assumed that factive and veridical predicates, as well as verbs of proffering, force their complement to be closed off by a factive operator, irrespective of whether that complement is a proposition or a question (see Spector and Égré 2015 for related ideas). The proposed account relies on a theory of scope in which scope shift is encoded through percolation of scope indices constrained by a minimality condition (the Condition on Scope Shift; Neeleman & Van de Koot 2012). Therefore, to the extent that the account presented is successful, it provides support for this particular view of scope-taking.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002772/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002772<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>UCL, Leeds University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>polar questions, outside negation, subjective epistemic modals, epistemic containment, scope freezing, factivity, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>547 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002772">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002772">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
