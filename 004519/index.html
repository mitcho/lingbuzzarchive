Based on the distributional requirements and semantic effects associated with full vs. clitic determiners, I endorse a version of Elbourne/Schwarz’ approach to the distinction whereby full determiners correspond to a more complex syntactico-semantic representations which, in addition to a maximality operator D, involve a relational predicate R and a pronominal element. I draw a parallel between the R component and Fox’ trace conversion operation, an analogy which accounts for the robust semantic interaction between relative clauses and full determiners, overt relative clauses essentially being an extension of the relational component which is an intrinsic part of the full determiner’s structure. I group bound determiners into two classes, those which give rise to maximal interpretation and those that do not. Based on a typological sample, the former property is shown to come with a morphosyntactic edge effect, which in some languages leads to the appearance of another determiner in the presence of a modifier. I suggest that this effect arises from the requirement that the maximality component take scope over the whole DP, which can arguably be grounded in independent semantic principles. The class of bound determiners not associated with maximal interpretation is characterized in terms of relations obtaining between the denotation of the noun phrase and some referent in linguistic or extralinguistic context. I propose to capture the variation within this class in terms of possible ranges of relations available for a determiner in a given language.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004519/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004519<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in the Oxford Handbook of Determiners</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>determiners, definiteness, double definiteness, specificity, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>89 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004519">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004519">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
