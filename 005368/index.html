Put in different terms, we argue that, to license VP ellipsis, T must enter into a Spec-Head agreement relationship with the phrase in its specifier, and must be in a c-command relationship with a local v head that has a [tense] value. We therefore revive and extend the “Spec-Head agreement” analyses first entertained by Saito & Murasugi (1990) and Lobeck (1995). Novel support for this analysis comes from the behaviour of VP ellipsis in copular clauses in which the occupant of SpecTP is not a standard referential DP, but an expletive or predicate (proform). We demonstrate that, in these “Unusual Subject” configurations, VP ellipsis is judged as acceptable only if T and the unusual subject engage in a Spec-Head agreement relationship. Because this correlation is also attested in Unusual Subject raising configurations and in Unusual Subject configurations in which British English do ellipsis occurs, we also provide new support for the proposal that matrix T licenses VP ellipsis in to-infinitive complement clauses (Zagona 1988, Lobeck 1995) and for the idea that British English do ellipsis is no different from standard VP ellipsis from a syntactic perspective (Thoms & Sailor 2018, contra Aelbrecht 2010, Baltin 2012). With respect to the timing of ellipsis, we provide decisive evidence against “derivational-timing” approaches to VP/do ellipsis in English.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005368/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005368<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Lipták, Anikó & Güliz Güneş (eds.)
