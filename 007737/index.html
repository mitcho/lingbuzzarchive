Here, we first suggest that many of the arguments ride on misunderstandings of the original claims from generative phonology, and that the typical evidence furnished is consistent with those claims. We then narrow in on the phenomenon of incomplete neutralisation and show again that it is consistent with the classic generative phonology view. We further point out that extant accounts of the phenomenon do not achieve important desiderata and typically do not provide an explanation for either the phenomenon itself, or why there are actually at least two different kinds of incomplete neutralisation that don’t stem from task confounds. Finally, we present new experimental data and our explanation that the phenomenon is an outcome of planning using abstract/discrete phonological knowledge. [UPDATE: we expanded discussion in some parts, and corrected a few small errors in the original ms.]<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007737/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007737<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>abstract/discrete representations, planning effects, incomplete neutralisation, tone sandhi, huai’an mandarin, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007737/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2023]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1104 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007737">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007737">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
