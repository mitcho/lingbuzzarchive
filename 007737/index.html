Here, we first suggest that many of the arguments ride on a misunderstanding of some of the original claims within the generative phonology tradition, and in fact, the typical contradictory evidence furnished is consistent with those claims. We then narrow in on the phenomenon of incomplete neutralisation and show again that it is consistent with the classic generative view of abstract/discrete representations. We further point out that extant accounts of the phenomenon do not achieve important desiderata and don’t explain why there are actually at least two different kinds of incomplete neutralisation that don’t stem from task effects/confounds. Finally, we present new experimental data and our explanation that the phenomenon is an outcome of planning using abstract/discrete phonological knowledge.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007737/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007737<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>abstract/discrete representations, planning effects, incomplete neutralisation, tone sandhi, huai’an mandarin, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>412 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007737">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007737">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
