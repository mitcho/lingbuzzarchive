Syntactically, the causative head selects an `incomplete' projection of Voice, which is still waiting to merge with an external argument. I implement this using the selectional system of Bruening (2013), wherein selectional features project, and can themselves be selected. Thus, the Voice head is prevented from introducing an argument, the causative head introduces its own argument, and the number of arguments remains constant, despite the addition of the causative head. Semantically, the subject of the clause gets identified with two thematic roles associated with the same event, both of which are subcomponents of agentivity, though the exact subcomponents involved are not consistent across languages and constructions. The semantic effect of the NVI causative is therefore to associate the subject with more characteristics of agentivity than with the base verb. This leads to the interpretations common to NVI causatives, in some cases via conventionalized implicature.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007365/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007365<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>causatives, non-valency-increasing causatives, argument structure, selection, voice, syntax-semantics interface, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>519 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007365">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007365">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
