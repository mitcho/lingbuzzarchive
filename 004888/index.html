like fractional, frequentative, distributive and multiplicative numerals which present very interesting linguistic properties. However, research on numerals usually focus on either cardinal
or ordinal numerals. This paper provides a detailed description of the structure and formation
of non-cardinal and non-ordinal numerals in Akan as well as a constructionist account of their
properties. In the description of the facts, we show that the formal structure of the various
classes of numerals is quite regular because they inherit their structure from already existing
syntactic and morphological constructions in the language, including coordinate constructions,
compounds and reduplicated forms. In the proposed theoretical account, we show that Construction Morphology provides the appropriate tools for the analysis of the numerals because
the framework anticipates form-meaning disparities, thus making it possible to account for
both compositional and extra-compositional properties of the numerals. The properties of the
various types of numerals are captured in schemas which abstract over their general and idiosyncratic properties. We posit constructional idioms in which specific aspects of the numerals,
regarded as constructional properties, are prespecified in the schemas and inherited by instantiating constructions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004888/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004888<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Nordic Journal of African Studies</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>akan, constructional idioms, distributive, fraction, frequentative, multiplicative numerals, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>195 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004888">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004888">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
