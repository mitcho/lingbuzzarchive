We also consider some data of child-directed speech, as we believe that it is important for studies in first language acquisition take into account the role of input in language development. Lately, the effect of input on the acquisition process has received considerable attention. In much recent work on language acquisition within the constructivist framework (e.g. Tomasello 2003, Theakston et al. 2004), it is argued that input frequency is vital to understanding both the order of acquisition of particular constructions and childrens non-target-consistent production. Here we argue that input frequency plays a role in the acquisition of word order, but only in combination with other factors. The children in this study are acquiring a Northern dialect of Norwegian spoken in the city of Tromsø. Two constructions with similar input frequencies are investigated: embedded questions and (all) embedded clauses containing negation or an adverb. Both constructions are very infrequent in the input. Children make mistakes in embedded clauses with negation or an adverb, overgeneralizing the word order from main clauses (producing structures with verb movement across negation or an adverb). On the other hand, they do not overgeneralize main question word order into embedded questions (producing structures with verb movement across the subject). We argue that the lack of input cues for the target-consistent word order in itself is not the reason for childrens non-target-consistent production. However, low input frequency may be one of the contributing factors causing the target word order in embedded clauses with negation or an adverb to be acquired relatively late. While children have to rely on input to acquire the word order in lower domains of the clause, UG provides them with the information that embedded questions are different from main clause questions with respect to illocutionary force. Consequently children do not project the same functional architecture for the two constructions, and overgeneralization of features from main to embedded questions should therefore be impossible.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000399/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000399<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in the Proceedings of the DGfS 2005 Workshop</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>first language acquisition, verb movement, embedded clauses, input frequency, norwegian, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>651 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000399">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000399">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
