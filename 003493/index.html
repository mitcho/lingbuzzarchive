external argument of a passive verb into complement clauses (implicit control) is
not only restricted by the Revised Visser’s Generalization (van Urk 2013), but
also depends on the type of matrix predicate involved. While attitude matrix
predicates allow implicit control, non-attitude matrix predicates do not. Landau
takes this bifurcation to support his two-tiered theory of control, by assuming that
with non-attitude matrix predicates, the control relation is essentially a predication
relation, from which implicit arguments are independently excluded. In this paper,
we subject these claims to empirical scrutiny, showing that Landau’s
generalization on implicit control holds only in a subset of languages, while other
languages license implicit control with both types of matrix predicates. We
investigate and reject the hypothesis that the cross-linguistic split regarding the
acceptability of implicit control with non-attitude matrix predicates relates to
different types of implicit arguments, only some of them being syntactically
represented in a way that they can enter a predication relation; based on the
licensing of depictives, we conclude that in principle implicit external arguments of
passives in all languages (under consideration) can enter predication. As an
alternative hypothesis about what distinguishes the two sets of languages, we
argue that languages which allow implicit control with non-attitude verbs are
exactly those languages that allow impersonal passives of unergative verbs and
we provide an attempt to account for this correlation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003493/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003493<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>implicit control, obligatory control, depictives, predication, (non-)attitude verbs, impersonal passives, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>234 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003493">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003493">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
