These facts are discussed wrt three different approaches to clausal structure. NN is problematic for a head movement account (cf. Cinque 1999) because multiple verbs may precede a given adverb, leading to violations of the Head Movement Constraint. A multiple positions account (cf. Ernst 2002, Svenonius 2002) would assume that any adverb in StN and NN can be adjoined to high positions, which may be problematic wrt scope relations. A remnant movement approach (cf. Nilsen 2003) can account for both StN and much of the NN data by means of one generalisation, but a separate generalisation is needed for finite verbs in NN. Thus, all three approaches are faced with challenges wrt the Norwegian data. However, it is argued that the remnant movement approach seems the most promising of the three approaches.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000180/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000180<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>published in Nordic Journal of Linguistics 28.2, 2005</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>adverbs, head movement, multiple adverb positions, norwegian, remnant movement, verb movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>351 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000180">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000180">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
