In this paper, I tie the distribution of intervention and the nature of interveners to the interpretation of movement configurations at LF. Building mainly on data from intervention effects in English and Japanese, I show that movement cannot target a region in the structure in which focus alternatives are simultaneously computed. I propose that this restriction on the grammar of scope-taking is the result of a logical problem with Predicate Abstraction computed over non-singleton alternatives. This problem is noted in Rooth’s (1985) seminal work introducing the theory of alternatives, and in later work such as Poesio (1996); Hagstrom (1998); Kratzer and Shimoyama (2002); Shan (2004);Novel and Romero (2009); Charlow (2015, 2017); Beck (2016); Ciardelli, Roelofsen, and Theiler (2017), who all attempt to correct this problem in some way. I argue instead that the data presented in this paper provide an empirical argument for a static, simple-typed system with movement alongside alternative computation as scope-taking mechanisms. Dynamic access to assignments may only be possible at certain intervals — clause or phase edges. The proposal has far-reaching implications for how a wide array of linguistic phenomena should be modeled, including the nature of movement, reconstruction, focus, and intensionality.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004678/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004678<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>manuscript</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>intervention effects, scope-taking, assignment function, wh-questions, movement, focus alternatives, predicate abstraction, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>458 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004678">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004678">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
