The two parts of these expressions are case distinct and also positionally split by a preposition, when there is one, as in, for example, hvor um annan, lit. “each.NOM about other.ACC” = ‘about each other’. The positional properties and the case marking patterns of these standard Icelandic expressions are cross-linguistically rare. In roughly the last two centuries, though, everyday Icelandic has developed innovative and less exotic reciprocals and distributives, where the two parts of the expressions are adjacent (as in most related languages) and commonly case congruent, as in um hvorn annan ‘about each.ACC other.ACC’, or, in the case of the distributives, um sitthvorn, lit. “about their-each.ACC”. In this paper, we report on a corpus study of these innovative reciprocals and distributives and discuss how they relate to the traditional standard expressions. We propose that the traditional expressions are derived by what we refer to as e-raising, whereby the first of the two items involved, most commonly hvor, is raised from its base position to
the base position of its antecedent prior to case marking, thereby getting the same case as its antecedent. The major difference between the old and the new expressions is that the latter lack e-raising.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006531/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006531<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Working Papers in Scandinavian Syntax 106, 2021, 1–16</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>icelandic, reciprocals, distributives, case, case agreement, e-raising, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>166 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006531">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006531">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
