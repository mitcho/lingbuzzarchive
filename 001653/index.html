Such a conception of the structure of human cognition must be at the same time restricted enough to account for the representations licensed by the phenomenological world, and flexible enough to allow for the inclusion of further layers of information as required by determined faculties (all interpretative components of the mind, with neurological basis, respond to localist principles). Moreover, we claim that all variation between faculties is the result of the interpretative systems (or the absence of interpretation at all), since generation can be subsumed to a single concatenation algorithm to be applied in n-dimensional mental workspaces (Baddeley 1992; D’Espósito 2007). In language this has crucial consequences for the theory of syntax-semantics interface: generation is driven by the need to derive significant effects on the output, in particular, to increase the informational load.
We intend to show that our proposal finds support in the characteristic properties of the three generative systems represented by language, mathematics (geometry) and music, i.e. we intend to show how all three are interconnected and locative in nature. We will use numerals as the bridge between language and the musical and arithmetical capacities.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001653/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001653<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Poster presented at Cognitive Modules and Interfaces, international workshop at SISSA, Trieste, Italy.
