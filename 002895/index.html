These structures feature a nominal or pronominal element – in this case, him – that functions semantically as the possessor of a separate DP – eye – and syntactically as a dependent of the verb. Syntactic approaches to possessive dative constructions in such languages as Hebrew and German argue for a movement analysis in which the possessor starts out in the possessum DP before moving to a higher position. Semantic approaches to the same phenomenon in German and French, among other languages, analyze possessive dative constructions as instances of anaphoric binding; the dative undergoes first-merge outside the possessum DP and binds a variable in it. The present article documents and analyzes what appear to be instances of possessive dative constructions in Lebanese Arabic. I show that the possessive construal of the datives in these structures is not syntactically or semantically mediated, but rather pragmatically determined.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002895/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002895<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Brill’s Journal of Afroasiatic Languages and Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>arabic – datives - external possession – possessor raising – context-linked grammar, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>648 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002895">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002895">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
