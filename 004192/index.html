I had some people tell me that it was worth posting, though I believe many of the ideas in this work have been superseded in part by my own work on post-suppositional distributivity constraints (e.g., 2014), as well as work by Champollion (e.g, 2015a), Hoi Ki Law (e.g. 2015, to appear), and others.


Some English sentences are ambiguous between collective and distributive read-
ings.
(1) John and Mary wrote a paper.
a. =John wrote a paper and Mary wrote a paper.
b. =John and Mary wrote a paper together.

But such sentences are not always ambiguous, distance distributive (DD)-each forces the distributive reading.

(2) John and Mary wrote a paper each.

More interestingly, it also constrains the denotation of the subject and the object.

(3) a. *Most professors wrote a book each.
b. *The professors wrote most books each.

The following analysis develops an account of these facts and others in a dynamic framework. The central idea is that DD-each needs an associate that introduces a free variable. DD-each then imposes a constraint that requires this variable to be evaluated with respect to a set of auxiliary functions that must all survive into the output. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004192/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004192<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>unpublished</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>binomial each, dependent indefinites, dynamic semantics, distributivity, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>159 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004192">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004192">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
