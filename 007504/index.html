(That the First Cognitive Revolution of the 17th Century contained “the sources of invention” for generative grammar was appreciated only in retrospect.) Chomsky discussed this historical connection at some length in Aspects (see especially Chomsky’s Cartesian Linguistics (1966/2009)), identifying Leibniz as one of his precursors in adopting the rationalist doctrine that “innate ideas and principles of various kinds [...] determine the form of the acquired knowledge in what may be a rather restricted and highly organized way” (Chomsky 1965: 48). There are in fact many aspects of Leibniz’s prodigious thought which anticipate core aspects of generative grammar, including some rather specific features of current theory. Below we sketch out what these are, and suggest that we should take Leibniz’s lead in situating the ideas about human nature that generative grammar as a theory of language embodies, and which Chomsky has expounded many times, in a wider philosophical context.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007504/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007504<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>50 Years Later: Reflections on Chomsky’s Aspects.
