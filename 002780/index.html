I show that "-te-un" and "-nu-un" carry not only temporal but also modal/evidential meanings and they do so in ways hitherto unnoticed. I claim that "-te-un" presents an eventuality from a retrospective point of view, providing a window into what I call ‘an evidential past’, whereas "-nu-un" does so from a projective point of view, providing a window into what I call ‘a metaphysical future’. The findings of this paper suggest that the line between Tense, Aspect, Mood, and Evidentiality can be blurrier in some languages than in others and when interpreting attributive clauses, what is construed as the viewpoint holder and in which direction the viewpoint is headed relative to some temporal anchor may matter greatly.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002780/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002780<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Studies in Language 40(2), 340-379</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>attributive clauses, imperfective, tense, aspect, modality, evidentiality, retrospective, projective, korean, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002780/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>365 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002780">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002780">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
