Focusing on wh-exclamatives and declarative exclamations, we offer a wide range of arguments for why they are both assertive including showing that they can be rejected and responded to (contrary to what previous literature has assumed). We further argue that like emotive verbs, exclamatives convey a presupposition not of factivity but of subjective veridicality anchored to the speaker, and assert the emotion (of surprise, amazement, or a negative emotion). Our analysis proposes a syntax-semantics for exclamatives without a speech act operator, and exclamativity surfaces as an attitude rather than a speech act. This seems to be well motivated by the Greek, German as well as English facts we examine in the paperâ€”which illocutionary operator approaches cannot capture while also failing to determine precisely what the exclamative force might be.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006137/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006137<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>assertion; emotive predicate; exclamation; exclamative</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>339 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006137">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006137">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
