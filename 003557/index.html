Gerunds are indeed verb phrases that appear in all positions of fully-expandable noun phrases, but infinitives and finite clauses, termed ‘verbal clauses’ in this study, actually never occur in noun phrase positions. What is shown here is that (i) verbal clauses that appear to be ‘objects’ of verbs are in clause-final position, rather than in the position of object noun phrases, and that (ii) initial verbal clauses that appear to be ‘subjects’ are in a pre-subject position where they bind a null expletive subject. The hypothesis in (ii) is tested and confirmed by showing that initial verbal clauses, in contrast to lexical noun phrases and gerunds, never occur in embedded or inverted subject positions. In this way, initial verbal clauses have the same distribution as other well-known ‘root’ or ‘focus’ constructions, which in pre-subject position are limited to main clauses.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003557/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003557<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>"From Theory to Practice 2013", Tomas Bata University Press, Zlin</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>clausal complement, expletive, extraposition, gerund, infinitive, topicalization, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>410 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003557">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003557">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
