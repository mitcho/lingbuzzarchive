English makes use of three types of verbs/ verbal constructions to denote processes related to colour: (i) verbs whose form is identical to that of the adjective/ noun they are derived from (such as to blue, to gray, to yellow, to brown, to green), (ii) verbs created with the suffix –en (such as to whiten, to blacken, to redden), (iii) verbal paraphrases (such as to turn pink/ orange). In contrast, in Romanian, one can note the use of (i) verbal paraphrases such as a face ca ceva să fie roz/ gri/ maro/ portocaliu ‘to make that something should be pink/ gray/ brown/ orange’, and (ii) verbs created with the prefix în- (a înălbi ‘to prefix-white-verbal suffix’- to whiten, a înnegri ‘to prefix-black-verbal suffix’- to blacken, a înroşi ‘to prefix-red-verbal suffix’- to redden, a îngălbeni ‘to prefix-yellow-verbal suffix’, a înverzi ‘to prefix-green-verbal suffix’). Most English colour verbs have the same form as the noun/ adjective they derive from (which is in line with the general observation that English tends to use identical denominal/ deajectival verbs (Hale & Keyser 2002)). Possibly in accordance with Berlin & Kay’s (1973) remark that there is a hierarchy of colours and colour words, the suffix –en in English is used with fundamental colours (red, white, black), while, for the other colours, no suffix is used. In contrast, Romanian uses the prefix în- in almost all cases (but there are exceptions e.g. a roşi ‘to blush’), while using paraphrases with more recent words denoting colours (roz ‘pink’, maro ‘brown’, portocaliu ‘orange’).
From an aspectual point of view, verbs denoting colour processes are degree achievements (expressing a gradual change of state) (Hay, Kennedy &Levin 1999). They display both telic and atelic properties, combining both with for-phrases and in-phrases (I reddened the wall in 5 minutes, I reddened the wall for an hour). Moreover, they can essentially appear in two structures (an intransitive one: The wall yellowed, and a transitive one: I yellowed the wall). In Romanian, the first structure is expressed with the help of a reflexive clitic (Peretele s-a îngălbenit ‘The wall clitic reflexive-has prefix-yellowed’), while the transitive form is similar to the one in English (Am îngălbenit peretele ‘Have yellowed the wall’).
Combining Ramchand’s analysis (2008, 2014) with Brody’s (2000) idea that the intermediary level should be eliminated, I embrace the view that words spell out a span, i.e. a complement sequence of heads (@ indicates where the span spells out, and * the formation of a word with the head immediately below). I discuss a causative and locative meaning of -en and în- for English and Romanian (to redden= to cause to pass in a state of red).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003135/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003135<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Colour and Colour Naming: Crosslinguistic Approaches, João	Paulo	Silvestre, Esperança	Cardeira	&	Alina	Villalva	(eds.),  Centro da Linguistica da Lisboa,	Universidade de Aveiro, 2016</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>colour verbs, spanning, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>68 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003135">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003135">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
