This article builds on (and provides indirect support for) the idea that quotations are to be defined pragmatically as (quasi )linguistic demonstrations. Such a perspective sheds new light on constructions involving denomination, identification and typification  all of which are related to autonymy  and also on the possibility of quoting extralinguistic matters like sounds and even emotions. Based on these possibilities, a syntactic typology of direct speech is developed, including independent, embedded, and parenthetic quotations, with several subtypes. It is shown that quotations are grammatically opaque, and that embedded quotations are assigned a nominal categorial status upon insertion into a syntactic derivation. Thus, it is explained that a quotation can be used not only as a full argument, but also as as a nominal head  even as a part of a compound.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000524/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000524<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to be published in Studia Linguistica</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>quotation, direct speech, demonstration, spoken language, autonymy, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>215 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000524">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000524">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
