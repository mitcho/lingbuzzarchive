Both types are formed with a wh-word that has the stem 'welch' but one is inflected whereas the other one is uninflected. Semantically, inflected 'welchE' is the equivalent of English 'which', i.e. in a 'which/welchE' question, given a set of entities that have the property specified by the complement of 'which/welchE', the speaker asks the addressee to pick out the entity or entities that make the proposition true. 'WelchE' phrases are d-linked (Pesetsky 1987) just like English which-phrases. Uninflected 'welch' might be compared to English 'what' a as in 'What a nice dress!.' 'Welch' has been suggested to trigger the presupposition that the property denoted by its complement applies to a high degree (D'Avis 2001). In this paper I explore the distribution of 'welch' and 'welchE' in different types of speech acts. I show that in Standard German 'welch' is neither generally restricted to formal registers, nor is it restricted to exclamatives, as had been assumed in the literature. 'Welch' also occurs in rhetorical ques-tions. Furthermore, it can occur in ordinary questions but there it is indeed restricted to a non-neutral register, which, however, is not necessarily formal. For the semantics of 'welchE' I argue that its overall distribution follows from its d-linking characteristics. For 'welch' I propose that it is a degree expression that binds the degree variable of a gradable predicate and introduces a standard degree that needs to be exceeded.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005746/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005746<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In Holden HÃ¤rtl (Hrsg.), Interfaces of Morphology.
