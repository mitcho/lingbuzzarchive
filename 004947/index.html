In particular, it focuses on the issue of their "mixed" distribution viz. the observation that during a long period of time the le/la/les-forms in French do not pattern as either (anaphoric) demonstratives from which they originate (Late Latin ille), nor as (uniqueness-based) definites, which they end up becoming in Modern French. We model the phenomenon as a competition between two grammars which ascribe different Logical Forms to the l-forms and test model predictions in contexts which differ with respect to whether they satisfy the relevant conditions. We also propose that this change was part of a larger change involving the spread of presupposition triggers within noun phrases. We show that our model correctly predicts the relative rates of determiner spread in various contexts.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004947/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004947<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>in press in Canadian Journal of Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language change, determiner evolution, determiner semantics, grammar competition, medieval french, corpus linguistics, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>242 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004947">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004947">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
