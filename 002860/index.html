In Mi’gmaq, there are at least two different synchronically productive constructions that can both be superficially called “incorporation” - Medial/Stem-internal Incorporation and Denominal Verbs. 

In this paper I compare the two constructions and show that they differ structurally, but are similar in that the incorporated element in both is categorized (i.e. a noun), which occupies the lowest head in the structure. 

The proposed analysis provides an in-depth look into morphology in Mi’gmaq, situated within the generative syntactic framework of Distributed Morphology (DM) (Halle and Marantz 1993; Marantz 1997). More broadly, this study advances our understanding of how words are built up in polysynthetic languages by supporting a case-by-case approach: two given constructions may be called “NI”, but they may also have different syntaxes.

Ultimately, this study shows that when all word formation is done in the syntax the difference between noun incorporation and compounding becomes not so clear.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002860/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002860<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>McGill University, Montreal QC</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>noun incorporation, denominal verb, distributed morphology, algonquian, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>167 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002860">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002860">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
