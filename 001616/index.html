Wh-movement is an instance of free non-feature-driven movement. The core evidence comes from (Slavic) modal existential wh-constructions, in which the landing site of wh-movement can be CP, VP, AP, AdvP, or NP. The landing site of wh-movement in particular constructions is derived from interpretable properties of those constructions, such as the Q(uestion) feature in questions. The paper also discusses various consequences and predictions of this approach: Wh-questions are predicted to always be CPs (even in a language where wh-movement can target lower projections); apparent wh-questions in Italian which are transparent for clitic climbing (e.g. Rizzi 1978) are predicted not to be questions at all (as argued e.g. by Cinque 2006); the fact that relative clauses always seem to be CP-based suggests the existence of an interpretable functional head at the relative CP-level.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001616/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001616<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>wh-movement, wh-features, interface, modal existential wh-constructions, questions, relative clauses, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>242 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001616">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001616">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
