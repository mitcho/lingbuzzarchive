To this end, I present evidence from a linguistic phenomenon where grammatical perspective has long been observed to play a central role â€” namely, non-local anaphora (a cover-term not only for long-distance anaphora and backward anaphora but also for logophora). The evidence that I provide comes primarily from Tamil, a language of the Dravidian family, spoken predominantly in parts of South India. Non-local anaphora in Tamil, like in Icelandic, Italian, Japanese and in its fellow Dravidian language Malayalam, is perspective-driven: i.e. the antecedent of a successfully bound anaphor must denote a mental or spatio-temporal perspective-holder toward some predication containing the anaphor. However, unlike the other languages mentioned here, Tamil provides compelling evidence in the form of verbal agreement that the perspective that regulates anaphoric dependencies is syntactically represented. In particular, I will argue that the agreement marking that obtains on the clausemate verb of the anaphor in Tamil, when this anaphor occurs in nominative case (the case that generally feeds agreement), seems to be anomalously triggered, not by the anaphor or by its antecedent, but by a silent perspectival pronoun local to the verb. Assuming that agreement is a morphosyntactic process, such a thesis, if correct, then entails that perspective must be syntactically (i.e. structurally and featurally) instantiated.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002893/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002893<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted (significantly revised version)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>perspective, anaphora, agree(ment), antecedence, binding, non-obligatory control, phi-features, indexical shift, grammatical modularity, tamil, syntax, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002893/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>845 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002893">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002893">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
