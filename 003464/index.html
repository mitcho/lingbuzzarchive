While each event is in some sense a singular unique occurrence, we generally talk about them as happening in a certain way with particular consequences, carrying on or ending after some amount of time, and involving different participants who bear particular relationships to the event. These conceptually general and grammatically relevant properties of events are captured in theories of event structure. The goal of such theories is to explain the patterns in meaning that arise from the structural aspects of language. Event structures do this by decomposing an individual event into a set of subevents which stand in particular relationships to one another. These component subevents and their relationships are often encoded in independently articulated linguistic constituents that are scattered throughout a sentence. As a result, these components must be recovered and put back together for a comprehender to properly understand the event that a sentence denotes.

This chapter examines how some of the grammatically-determined interpretations arising from event structure unfold in real time, with a focus on sentence processing. We will examine studies from the psycholinguistic literature that have investigated different aspects of event structure using a variety of experimental techniques.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003464/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003464<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>event structure, psycholinguistics, sentence processing, experimental semantics/pragmatics, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>382 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003464">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003464">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
