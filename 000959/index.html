<p><strong>Identity Thesis for Language and Music:</strong><br>

<em>All formal differences between language and music are a consequence of 

  differences in their fundamental building blocks (arbitrary pairings of sound 

  and meaning in the case of language; pitch-classes and pitch-class combinations 

  in the case of music).  In all other respects, language and music are identical. 

  </em> </p> </p>

<p>In particular, we argue, developing but also extending earlier proposals by Lerdahl 

  and Jackendoff (1983), that music, like language, contains a syntactic component 

  in which headed structures are built by <i>iterated, recursive, binary Merge</i>.  

  This is the component that Lerdahl and Jackendoff called <i>Prolongational Reduction</i>, 

  which represents hierarchical patterns of tension and relaxation in tonal harmony. 

  We further argue that the distinct component that Lerdahl and Jackendoff called 

  <i>Time Span Reduction</i> is a musical prosodic component (a point anticipated 

  by Lerdahl and Jackendoff themselves) -- whose interface with the syntactic 

  component is strikingly similar to the comparable interface between syntactic 

  and prosodic structure in language.</p>

<p>Though our discussion takes Lerdahl and Jackendoff's work as a starting point 

  and touchstone throughout, our proposals also constitute a significant realignment 

  of their model -- necessary in order to reveal similarities between musical and linguistic 

  structure that were not evident in their presentation.  This realignment 

  also reflects a distinction in goals between our proposal and theirs. Their 

  work took as its starting point the question "Given a piece of music in a particular musical idiom <i>I</i>, what laws govern the class of analyses 

 that a listener assigns to it in <i>I</i>?" Our proposals arise from a related but 

  distinct question, more typical of generative linguistic work: "What general laws define the class of possible pieces in <i>I</i>?"  That is, what is the grammar of <i>I</i>?</p>

<p>Our realignment of Lerdahl and Jackendoff's proposals in light of the Identity Thesis allows us to ask questions 

  not taken up in their work. For example, does <i>Internal Merge</i> (i.e. <i>syntactic 

  movement</i>) apply in the construction of musical syntactic structure, in addition 

  to <i>External Merge</i>? We argue that the phenomenon of <i>cadence</i> is 

  an instance of exactly this: head-movement from the penultimate constituent 

  of a musical passage (the dominant) to the final tonic chord.

<p>Finally, we argue that the output of musical syntax feeds a <i>Tonal-Harmonic 

  Component</i> whose formal relation to the music syntax strongly resembles the 

  relation between linguistic syntax and the semantic system that interacts with it -- and is subject to a <i>Principle of Full Interpretation </i> with respect to 

  that component.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000959/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000959<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000959">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000959</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>music, syntax, prosody, cadence, merge, head movement, lerdahl, jackendoff, gttm, syntax (phonology)</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000959/v2.pdf">v2 [January 2011]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000959/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2009]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>4295 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000959">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000959">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
