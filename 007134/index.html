In canonical instances, building syntactic structures bottom-to-top via Merge correlates with an acquisition sequence where structurally lower things are acquired before structurally higher things. But this also allows for nuanced derivational timing in adult grammars, with the prediction that deviations from strict cyclic derivations should have parallel acquisition timelines that deviate from the canonical bottom-up acquisition sequence. So DMS provides a rationale for the existence of apparent paradoxes like countercyclicity in adult grammar (e.g. Late Merger and look-ahead problems). 

This manuscript lays the theoretical foundation for DMS, builds the case that DMS is empirically plausible based on what is known about acquisition, and suggests directions for future empirical work to further evaluate its viability.
