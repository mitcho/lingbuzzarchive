wordlist size for drawing phonological generalizations about languages.
Given a limited lexicon for an under-documented language, are conclusions
that can be drawn from those data representative of the language as a
whole? Linguistics necessarily involves generalizing from limited data, as
documentation can never completely capture the full complexity of a
linguistic system. We performed a series of sampling experiments on 36
Australian languages in the Chirila database (Bowern 2016) with lexicons
ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 items. The purpose was to identify the
smallest wordlist size to achieve: (1) full phonemic coverage for each
language, and (2) accurate phonemic distribution compared to the full
dataset. We hypothesize that when these two criteria are met they represent
a minimally complete sample of a language for basic phonological typology.
The results show coverage is consistently achieved at an average lexicon
size of approximately 400 items, regardless of the original lexicon size
sampled from. These results hold broad significance, given the
predominance of word lists smaller than 400 items. For fieldwork, this study
also provides a guideline for designing documentation tasks in the face of
limited time and resources. These results also help to make empiricallygrounded decisions about which datasets are suitable for use for which
research tasks. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004904/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004904<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Language Documentation and Description</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>basic vocabulary, language documentation, phonology, inventories, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>252 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004904">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004904">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
