Active discussion was initiated by Nishimura’s (2003) discovery that in Japanese loanword phonology, voiced geminates can be devoiced, when they co-occur with another voiced obstruent (e.g. /doggu/ → /dokku/). This context-sensitive devoicing of geminates has received much theoretical attention since then, and has been analyzed within several different theoretical frameworks. Subsequently, the phonetic and psycholinguistic natures of voiced geminates have also been explored, in tandem with corpus-based analyses and computational modeling. It thus seems safe to say that this devoicing pattern of voiced geminates in Japanese has had some substantial impacts in the recent theoretical literature and related field. The empirical focus of this paper is on one simple devoicing phenomenon in Japanese, but implications for general linguistic theories are discussed throughout.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002161/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002161<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>(2015) Language and Linguistic Compass. 9(4): 168–182</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>japanese, geminate, devoicing, ocp, phonetics, acoustics, perception, psycholinguistics, phonological judgment, frequency, corpus study, sociolinguistics, phonetics, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002161/v2.pdf">v2 [September 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002161/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3291 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002161">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002161">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
