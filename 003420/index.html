As a step towards answering this question, I test, refine, and derive an observation from Link 1983: that predicates built from many intransitive verbs are  understood distributively, while predicates built from many transitive verbs can be understood nondistributively as well as distributively.  I argue that Link's observation is driven by the behavior of two large classes of predicates built from transitive verbs: causative predicates (lift the table), and incremental-object predicates (eat the cookie). These classes of predicates describe events that can systematically be ``split'' between  members of the subject, giving rise to a nondistributive understanding.  More generally,  researchers agree that a predicate's potential for distributivity is grounded in world knowledge about the event described by that predicate.  To make that idea explanatory, this paper takes a step towards understanding what world knowledge matters and why<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003420/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003420<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>distributivity, lexical semantics, pragmatics, argument structure, world knowledge, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003420/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2017]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>435 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003420">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003420">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
