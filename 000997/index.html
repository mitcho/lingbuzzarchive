This chapter starts with some historical overview; when phonology was being established as its own area of research, there was a sharp division between phonetics and phonology. This division was called into question, and the issues on the phonetics-phonology interface are currently extensively pursued by an approach that is now known as laboratory phonology. After the historical overview, I discuss in some detail how phonetic experiments and phonological theories have informed each other.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000997/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000997<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In M. van Oostendorp, C.
