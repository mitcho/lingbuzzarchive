Specifically, theories differ with respect to dealing with these cases in positive and negative contexts. The implicature approach, on the one hand, predicts an inherent asymmetry between positive and negative sentences: plural definites are predicted to straightforwardly allow for non-maximal readings in positive sentences but not in negative ones. The non-implicature approach, on the other hand, makes symmetric predictions: all else being equal, non-maximal readings should be available to the same degree in positive and negative sentences. Previous experimental work found evidence for an asymmetry between positive and negative cases, more in line with the implicature approach. However, as previous studies did not control for potential contextual effects, we cannot rule out that context may have affected non-maximality in the two cases in different ways, thus giving rise to the observed asymmetry in a way that is compatible with both approaches. In this paper, we report on two experiments using a picture-sentence verification task, testing the effect of context on the non-maximality of plural definites in positive and negative sentences. More specifically, we tested sentences containing the plural definite ‘his/her presents’ under a positive quantifier ‘every boy/girl’ and two negative quantifiers ‘no boy/girl’ and ‘not every boy/girl,’ manipulating what was relevant in the context. Our results indicate that while non-maximal readings under all three quantifiers is modulated by context, the effect size is much smaller for no than for the other two quantifiers. We argue that these findings pose challenges for both types of theories, and discuss possible amendments of each approach in order to account for our findings. We also sketch how the same experimental design can be extended to test related phenomena, where we find similar debates between implicature and non-implicature accounts.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007106/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007106<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>proceedings of SuB 27</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>plural definites, homogeneity, non-maximality, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>334 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007106?_s=oh7KNkeyMr4UhsXX&amp;_k=SE1w_4qG2-mkh5-f&amp;10">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007106?_s=oh7KNkeyMr4UhsXX&amp;_k=SE1w_4qG2-mkh5-f&amp;11">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
