Based on the evidence, we claim that the multiple nominative construction be analyzed as a pure sequence, proposing that it is an instance of order-restricted flat-formation operation Form Sequence, which Chomsky (2019b/UCLA, 2020/LSJ, 2021b/WCCFL) proposes as one of the true components of Universal Grammar (UG) along with the order-free set-formation operation MERGE. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will provide novel data showing that there is no formal c-command relation between multiple nominative phrases. In Section 3, we will propose to derive the multiple nominative construction from Form Sequence, and show that the proposal can provide a principled explanation for the fact that the multiple nominative construction is a root phenomenon, which was previously not well understood. Furthermore, in this section, we will consider why the multiple nominative construction is not allowed in English, presenting a Determinacy-based account for the impossibility. We will also scrutinize the properties of Form Sequence through a comparison with MERGE, pointing out that Form Sequence may be a more general and basic operation than MERGE, and confirming that the analysis of multiple subject constructions based on Form-Sequence is not ad hoc.
