The most prominent current accounts (e.g., Rohrbacher 1999) require inspection of the internal make-up of paradigms and take overt morphological variation to be the cause of syntactic variation. These proposals are shown here to be empirically untenable on the basis of evidence from dialect comparisons, diachronic changes, speaker variation, language-internal differences among constructions and acquisition data. In all cases, we find syntactic variation attested in the absence of corresponding morphological variation. Proposed weakenings of the RAH (drawing only a one-way implication from rich morphology to verb movement) are shown to be inconsistent with the morphology-driven approaches they claim to instantiate, or at best, incomplete. It is also noted that approaches relying on the overt marking of contrasts within a paradigm stand in conflict with results of current morphological theory. An alternative is considered that overcomes these problems. It is recognized that there are correlations between syntactic variation and morphological variation which do stand to empirical verification, and are thus to be explained. The particular correlations that are attested (and the attested domain of indeterminacy) follow from a theory which takes morphology to be not the cause, but rather a reflection, of syntactic structure, in line with standard theorizing in morphology.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000110/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000110<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dm, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>515 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000110">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000110">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
