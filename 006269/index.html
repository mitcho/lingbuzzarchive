The aim of this system is to provide a means of annotating the core components of prosody (especially with respect to intonation) on separate tiers. This includes information such as pitch turning points, pitch ranges, prominence and phrases. A hallmark of PoLaR is that these features can be annotated  separately from one another and systematically, in a way that is not offered by other popular systems of intonational annotation; at the same time, PoLaR also provides advanced labellers with optional labels that can annotate analyses of how these features are related to one another. PoLaR's shallow learning curve, its flexibility, and its extensibility make PoLaR useful and accessible to a wide variety of researchers, from a wide variety of backgrounds, working on a wide variety of languages and varieties.
 
The structure of this monograph is as follows. After providing background context for PoLaR in Chapter 1, Chapters 2 and 3 comprise the annotation guidelines. After the official guidelines, we discuss details about how PoLaR has been explicitly designed to be customized or expanded upon (Chapter 4), as well as some usage cases for PoLaR and some of its advantages (Chapter 5).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006269/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006269<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>prosody, intonation, annotation, polar, phonetics, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>587 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006269">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006269">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
