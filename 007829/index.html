rules to determine the values the agreement target has to copy. Across languages,
resolution for person features typically follows a hierarchy of the form 1>2>3 (Zwicky 1977) – with some well-known exceptions, namely German and
Dutch coordinations conjoining 2nd and 3rd person which allow for both agreement
options (Findreng 1976, Timmermans et al. 2004, Corbett 2006). This paper
takes a closer look at resolution agreement in German, Dutch, Norwegian,
Swedish, and Icelandic. The German(ic) anomaly provides evidence for the presence
of an underlying binary feature system and the need for set union as a resolution
mechanism. The pattern is derived within the framework of Distributed
Morphology where vocabulary insertion happens late and is thereby sensitive to
decomposed and unified feature sets. Crucial for the account is an independently
motivated impoverishment rule that tracks the absence of 1st person inclusive exponents in Germanic.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007829/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007829<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>accepted to appear in The Journal of Comparative Germanic Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>resolution, coordination, conjunction, markedness, person features, clusivity, germanic, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>87 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007829">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007829">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
