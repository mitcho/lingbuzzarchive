To understand language acquisition thus requires precise statements about these components and their interplay, stepping beyond the philosophical and methodological disputes in the field such as the generative vs. usage-based approaches. I review three simple equations that have guided the study of child language acquisition: How learners form and select linguistic hypotheses, and how re- searchers assess the progress of language acquisition with rigor and clarity. Furthermore, I suggest that these equations are equally applicable to second language acquisition, yielding potentially important insights on the continuities and differences between child and adult language.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003872/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003872<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Approaches to Bilingualism (Target article)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language acquisition, l1, l2, computational linguistics, corpus linguistics, productivity, usage-based, morphology, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>372 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003872">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003872">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
