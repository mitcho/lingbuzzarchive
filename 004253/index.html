Previous work on Tuparí discussed basic phonology and morphology only (Caspar and Rodrigues 1957, Seki 2001, Alves 2004); this dissertation, in contrast, addresses a wide range of grammatical questions with a special focus on the syntactic organization of the Tuparí clause. All the data presented and analyzed here were collected by the author over the course of over eight months of on-site field research in Rondônia. Following the best practices of documentary linguistics, I prioritize naturally-occurring data over elicited examples throughout the dissertation. Much use is made of the texts included in a 2016 literacy workbook edited by myself in collaboration with several indigenous schoolteachers, as well as from a separate text collection now in progress. *****PLEASE NOTE: chapter five has been superseded by "The clausal organization of Tuparí, an indigenous language of the Brazilian Amazon," published in Acta Linguistica Academica 67(4):429-479, and chapter six has been superseded by "Non-witnessed evidentiality in Tuparí and its connection to resultative constructions in the perfect aspect," published in International Journal of American Linguistics 85(3):401-45.*****<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004253/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004253<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Doctoral dissertation, University of Chicago</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>documentation, amazonian languages, tupían, tuparí, evidentiality, morphology, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>371 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004253">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004253">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
