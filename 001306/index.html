The core data comes from "that same day" in narrative discourse. I argue that unlike other previously studied temporal adverbials—which introduce a new time discourse referent and relate it to the speech time or a previously mentioned time—that same retrieves two salient times from the input context, i.e. it is ‘twice-anaphoric’, without introducing one of its own. Moreover, I argue that the adverb "currently" is like "that same day" in not introducing a new time discourse referent; it constrains the temporal location of a described eventuality relative to a salient time previously introduced into the discourse context. The analysis that I propose is implemented within Compositional Discourse Representation Theory. It illustrates how adverbial meaning can be integrated within a more general theory of temporal interpretation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001306/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001306<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of SALT 21</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>adverbials, anaphora, deixis, compositional discourse representation theory, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>196 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001306">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001306">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
