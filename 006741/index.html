Kim and Runner (2022) suggest that the analysis of pseudogapping in
Hybrid Type-Logical Grammar (Hybrid TLG) presented in Kubota and
Levine (2017) does not explain certain complex patterns of
pseudogapping for which their own proposal does offer an account.
Though Kim and Runner's (2022) remarks on Kubota and Levine (2017)
leaves room for interpretation, we take it to be reasonably clear that
they simply mean that it is difficult to see how such data could be
formally accounted for in Kubota and Levine's proposal. The primary
goal of our response is to refute Kim and Runner's claim on 
this interpretation. After refuting their claim on this
interpretation, we consider a different interpretation of their
remarks, one which merely questions the conceptual plausibility of
Kubota and Levine's (2017) broader theoretical architecture. This
latter discussion leads to some interesting and important
cross-theoretical comparison of different approaches to ellipsis.

Though our discussion reproduces some of the formal analysis from
Kubota and Levine (2014, 2017, 2020) for the purpose of clarity and
explicitness, our main goal is not to dwell on the technical details,
but rather to explain the key idea of the categorial grammar analysis
by Kubota and Levine in intuitive terms (which is actually quite
simple, once one figures out a way to temporarily withhold one's
familiar phrase structure-based conception of grammar). We believe
that even readers with zero background knowledge on categorial grammar
should be able to see clearly the relevant theoretical contention,
which will be of interest to any syntactician or semanticist,
especially those working in the domain of ellipsis, and regardless of
their theoretical persuasion.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006741/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006741<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in The Linguistic Review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pseudogapping, ellipsis, hpsg, categorial grammar, construction grammar, hybrid type-logical grammar, english, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006741/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>951 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006741">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006741">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
