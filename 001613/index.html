Essentially, the categorization of roots serves to classify linguistic information. In this dissertation I explore the categorization of roots in Blackfoot (Algonquian) and Lithuanian (Baltic), languages which are unrelated typologically or genetically. 
 Relying on the interaction between roots and affixes, I develop language specific diagnostics necessary to establish the categorial affiliation of a given root. I show that all Blackfoot roots are uniquely associated with a particular category, i.e. they are categorized. Meanwhile, Lithuanian roots split into two types: some are categorized, and some are category-neutral. This variation in the categorization of roots requires an explanation. 
 I propose that the categorial destiny of a root is determined by (i) a category intrinsic feature c (such as e.g., animacy, gender, transitivity, and degree); and (ii) the categorization structure hosting the feature c. 
 There are two sources of variation: i) the origin of the feature c; and ii) the content of the feature c. Roots that are endowed with the feature c prior to syntax are of a unique category; roots that attain their feature c in syntax are category-neutral. In addition, the content of feature c may differ across languages. 
 According to this proposal, the notion of category is not a primitive but a construct.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001613/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001613<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of British Columbia</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>roots, feature, gender, categorization, algonquian, blackfoot, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1462 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001613">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001613">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
