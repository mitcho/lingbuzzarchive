Taking as the starting point the well-known difference between NPs and VPs regarding extraction, where extraction from Complex NPs is not possible while extraction from Complex VPs is possible, the paper argues that the former represents a pervasive pattern found in many contexts, the latter being highly exceptional. More precisely, extraction is impossible not only from clausal but all complements of nouns. Furthermore, it is impossible from complements of prepositions and adjectives as well as ergative (and possibly passive) verbs. A deduction of the impossibility of extraction from the complements of lexical heads (other than non-ergative verbs) is proposed based on a new approach to phases (i.e. to what counts as a phase) and the Phase-Impenetrability Condition, as well as a particular implementation of Chomsky’s (2013) labeling algorithm. The analysis is extended to Condition on Extraction Domain (CED) effects and the that-trace effect.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002278/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002278<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in The Linguistic Review: The GLOW Issue</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>the complex np constraint, islands, labels, phases, the phase-impenetrability condition, the that-trace effect</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002278/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2697 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002278">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002278">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
