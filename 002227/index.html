class of possible determiners in natural languages: the so-called Conservativity Constraint. We shall briefly illustrate the force of this constraint and informally sketch Keenan and Stavi (1986)'s view according to which the Conservativity Constraint derives from the boolean
structure of natural language semantics. We shall proceed to discuss two well-known linguistic categories that have been argued to be
interpreted by non-conservative functions: "only" and the relative proportional "many". We shall take the challenge posed by the existence
of these categories in order to propose an alternative to the Conser-
vativity Constraint. This alternative will be dubbed the Witness Set
Constraint, which is inspired in Barwise and Cooper (1981)'s consider-
ations on the semantic processing of generalized quantifiers. We shall
defend that the proposed constraint does not suffer from the empirical
shortcomings that have been attributed to the Conservativity Constraint, and indeed, we shall argue in detail that it correctly predicts
(a) the existence of conservative determiners, (b) the non-existence
of certain non-conservative determiners, such as inner negations, and
most importantly, (c) the existence of the non-conservative functions
denoted by only and the relative proportional many. This line of
reasoning suggests that the class of generalized quantifiers permitted
in natural languages is constrained by a principle that simplifies the
semantic processing of sentences that contain generalized quantifiers.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002227/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002227<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>generalized quantifiers, conservativity, witness sets, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002227/v3.pdf">v3 [January 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002227/v2.pdf">v2 [October 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002227/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3905 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002227">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002227">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
