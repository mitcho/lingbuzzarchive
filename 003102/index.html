In general, the paper argues that there is no a priori way to connect intuitions of sentential deviance to a particular type of explanation, however these different sources of anomaly often make different empirical predictions. The paper both evaluates the general strategies behind each theory and demonstrates how to compare different types of theories (in particular, the presuppositional theory and the syntactic theory) by discussing a detailed case study: namely the distribution of quantifiers with respect to the mass-count distinction. In this case study, the syntactic explanation fairs better than the semantic and pragmatic approaches to the problem. Even thought the syntactic theory ends up providing the best explanation of the facts, it is important to note that the syntactic theory developed in this paper would not have been possible without the insights gained from the attempted pragmatic and semantic explanations. In other words, it is vital to linguistic inquiry to approach problems from multiple perspectives to get a better understanding of the empirical landscape and possible grammatical generalizations.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003102/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003102<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Draft</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sentential anomalies, contradictions, tautologies, presupposition failure, sub- categorization, mass-count distinction, quantifier distribution, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003102/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>775 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003102">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003102">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
