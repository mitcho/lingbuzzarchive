The Extended Evolutionary Synthesis( EES) attributes crucial role of epigenesis, i.e. the process of interaction of genes and environment at a molecular level by which the environment  guides the spatial and temporal expression of genes in the formation of the biological body. Moreover, it states that epigenetic processes  influence the trajectory of evolution by altering genomic expression. In essence, evolution of the phenotype is better explained  as evolution of developmental mechanisms. And these are guided by the environment as a selective agent for the phenotype and behaviour.   
    At the same time humans are species highly influenced by culture and learning which makes culture a decisive component of the environment as adaptive factor for human development.
Students of the evolution of language have argued for a strong influence of human ontogeny in the evolution of language although schools of thought diverge as some focus on epigenetic processes  in phylogenesis of the language faculty while others explore the role of language learning in cultural and social contexts in glossogenesis of linguistic diversity.  
    The article argues that through language-gene co-evolution some key aspects of language, learned anew at the very first stages of language origins, eventually alter the developmental mechanisms and become instinct-like predispositions, incorporated into a language faculty. In this way the very essential  and universal aspects of language become relegated to nature, while the idiosyncrasies of language systems continue to be learned and evolve subjected to social and cultural influences. Notably, learners of different ages contribute differently to the evolution of language. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008229/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008229<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>evolution of language, language faculty(lf), baldwin effect, evo-devo, extended evolutionary synthesis ( ees), epigenesis, ontogenesis, iterated learning, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>272 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008229">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008229">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
