In loanwords borrowed from French, the uvular fricative is systematically interpreted as a coronal tap, despite the fact that Arabic and Berber have phonemic /ʁ/ and /χ/. We argue that this phenomenon is determined by phonological rather than phonetic factors. We show that Tashlhiyt Berber and Moroccan Arabic speakers, including monolinguals, are able to identify the French r as a sonorant, based on their native phonology, where many co-occurrence restrictions are analyzed in terms of sonority-sensitive dependency relations between the most sonorous segment and its neighboring segments.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004422/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004422<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under revision</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>rhotics, french, berber, arabic, loanwords, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>329 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004422">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004422">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
