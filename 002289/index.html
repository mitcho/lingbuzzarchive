We redress this lacuna and argue for specific PUA reconstructions for two verbal domains: DIE and KILL. PUA had three distinct suppletive verb stems for these functions: *muku DIE.SG, *ko(i) DIE.PL, and *mɨɁa KILL.SG. PUA KILL.PL was derived by suffixing causative *-ya to the plural stem for DIE, thus *ko-ya. Other semantic functions are widespread enough to be reconstructable, but variation in attested morphs makes reconstructing forms difficult because of a lexical replacement process endemic to cases of strong suppletion: incursion (Juge 2000). We also find limited but suggestive evidence for possible areal contact effects involving diffusion of verbal suppletion patterns. In addition to contributing to scholarship on the diachrony and typology of verbal suppletion, our survey of UA languages also extensively documents suppletion in verbs that seems to be relatively “lexical”. The empirical evidence from these languages thus runs counter to claims from recent literature within theoretical morphology which holds that suppletion must be limited to “functional” vocabulary items.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002289/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002289<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Language Dynamics and Change (forthcoming)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>suppletion, diachrony, historical linguistics, uto-aztecan, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1298 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002289">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002289">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
