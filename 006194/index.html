I argue that unergative
predicates, traditionally defined as intransitive activity denoting verbs with agent argument,
can be structured in various ways in a language. In some languages, grammatical encoding of
unergatives is straightforward. In others, where agentivity and dyadicity are interdependent,
unergatives can be subject to argument structure modification, and construed as causatives
with Agent but without Theme.
The present analysis of Georgian unergative verbs contributes to two central theoretical
topics: (in)transitivity and nature of ergative case. Georgian is rare among ergative languages
as it displays intransitive split (Dixon 1979): the subject of unergatives is marked as ergative
and the subject of unaccusatives as nominative/absolutive. While other ergative languages
manifest this split to various degrees and optionally mark the subject of unergatives as
absolutive (Basque (Oyaharçabal 1992, Aldai 2009), Hindi (Butt & King 2003)), the subject
of unergatives in Georgian is always ergative in tenses with ergative case-alignment.
At first sight, Georgian, where unergative and transitive predicates are lumped for case
purposes, conforms to Hale & Keyser’s (1993) analysis of unergatives as transitives with
hidden Theme. Yet, structural properties of Georgian unergatives point to the absence of
internal argument. Their morphological makeup in perfective tenses suggests that unergatives
are not monovalent verbs either, as proposed by Perlmutter (1978) (cf. also Borer 2005,
Marantz 2007). Their sensitivity to Viewpoint aspect implies that unergatives pattern with
statives, with external Holder argument. The reason why unergatives cannot be underlyingly
agentive resides in the fact that Agent role is not an inherent property of predicates in
Georgian. It is configurationally defined by Neo-Burzio Dependency: Agent-introducing
category must select an argument-selecting complement. But as the traditional hallmark of
unergatives is agentivity, i.e. presence of an initiator in the sense of Dowty’s (1991) proto-
Agent role, their stative core must be modified. This is achieved by expanding the core in two
ways. In imperfective aspect, bundling of dynamic progressive Aspect features with stative
structure enables agentive interpretation of the external argument. In perfective aspect,
agenthood is structurally built by causativisation of stative structure. But as the added
argument with Agent role refers to the same event participant as the Holder, the causative
configuration is reflexivised signalled by the appropriate morphology.
If unergatives are structured as reflexive causatives in the perfective, the ergative case on their
subject is expected. In current theorizing, two approaches prevail on ergative case-marking:
(i) ergative is inherent, tied to agentivity, (Woolford 2006, Nash 1995, Johns 1993, Massam
2002, Legate 2008, a.o.); (ii) ergative is a structural dependent case, assigned to the higher of
the two arguments in the same domain (Marantz 1991, Nash 2017, Baker 2014, a.o.).
Analysing unergatives in perfective aspect as bivalent predicates with coindexed Agent and
Holder supports the dependent case theory: in Georgian, ergative is assigned to the higher
argument in a bi-argumental verbal template. The notion of inherent agentive case cannot be
applied to Georgian where Agent role is configurational and where presyntactically
determined agentive predicates do not exist. Georgian should not be defined as an active
language in the sense of Sapir (1917) and Mithun (1991), where agents are marked with
special semantic case (Harris 1985), but rather as a (split) ergative language where the highest
argument of bivalent eventive verbs bears ergative case (Hewitt 1987).
Furthermore, their combination with applied arguments calls for refinement of unergative
structures in Georgian. Datives are banned with behaviour denoting unergatives, while other
types of unergatives occur with part-whole and addressee datives. This asymmetry is best
accounted if behaviour denoting unergatives are construed as complex predicates comprising
a light verb and non-verbal predicate, while all others involve simplex verbs. The main
conclusion of this study is that unergative predicates in Georgian can be structured in several
ways, at vP level and at VoiceP level. These configurational options, shaped by general
structural constraints, yield a predicate with one agentive event participant, in conformity with
traditional definition of unergativity.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006194/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006194<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear at NLLT</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ergative case, unergative, stative, agent, holder, causatives, reflexivisation, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006194/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>316 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006194">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006194">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
