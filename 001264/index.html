It also argues for sharp modular contours between phonology and phonetics. Under the laryngeal relativism view, which involves arbitrary assignment of concrete phonetic categories to particular phonological representations, despite the opposite marking in the representation, the phonetic interpretation conventions in the two dialects of Polish yield identical phonetic facts, that is, symmetrical voice assimilations and final obstruent devoicing when limited to the domain of word. However, the true linguistic nature of all these phonetic phenomena is different – not every final devoicing or assimilation of voice can be viewed as a proper phonological phenomenon. Equally well, they could be merely interpretational. Likewise, the presence of long negative VOT in obstruents is not a guarantee of the presence of the feature |voice| or element |L| in the system. Spectrograms are not telling us what type of system we are dealing with. They only provide the information on the phonetic side of the equation. As a consequence, all the classic criteria for categoryhood in laryngeal phonology must be treated with reservation. Whether a given phenomenon is phonetic or phonological in nature can only be established through analysis, and working-out the entire system.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001264/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001264<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>laryngeal phonology, phonology-phonetics interface, polish, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>372 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001264">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001264">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
