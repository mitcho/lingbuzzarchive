We provide a new structural analysis of why and in what languages the passive diathesis can or cannot use the copula BE as a passive auxiliary. The empirical part comes from a comparative perspective within Germanic and Romance. We provide 1. language-internal structural variation in BE / WERDEN as passive auxiliaries in function of V2 and aspect, 2. comparative data of this variation, 3. diachronic data on Old English weorðan that ties the need of a separate passive auxiliary to the verb second (V2) constraint. It turns out that Old English displays a rise and fall of strict-V2 around 1000, as well as a rise and fall of weorðan. The relation between V2 and weorðan is imposed by the syntax-semantics interface. By modifying Giorgi's projection of  Reichenbach's event indexes S, E, and R onto the syntax, we show that the (in)equality of these indexes is not ruled by structural templates stored in the lexicon, but are dynamically ruled by the syntax.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002440/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002440<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>pre-print</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>passive auxiliary, verb second, romance, germanic, old english, reichenbach events, left-periphery, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1757 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002440">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002440">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
