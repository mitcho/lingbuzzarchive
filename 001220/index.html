The results of previous studies on compounding have been taken to support a number of important theoretical claims: &#64257;rst, that there are fundamental differences in the way that children and adults learn and process regular and irregular plurals, second, that these differences re&#64258;ect formal constraints that govern the way the way regular and irregular plurals are processed in language, and third, that these constraints are unlikely to be the product of learning. In a series of seven experiments, we critically assess the evidence that is cited in support of these arguments. The results of our experiments provide little support for the idea that substantively different factors govern the patterns of acquisition, production and interpretation patterns of regular and irregular plural forms in compounds. Once frequency differences between regular and irregular plurals are accounted for, we &#64257;nd no evidence of any qualitative difference in the patterns of interpretation and production of regular and irregular plural nouns in compounds, in either adults or children.  Accordingly, we suggest that the pattern of acquisition of both regular and irregular plurals in compounds is consistent with a simple account, in which children learn the conventions that govern plural compounding using evidence that is readily available in the distribution patterns of adult speech.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001220/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001220<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cognitive Psychology</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>compounding, inflection, morphology, phonology, semantics, informativity, distributional information, convention learning, corpus linguistics, phonology, morphology, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>200 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001220">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001220">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
