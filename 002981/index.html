In particular, it was tested whether children’s choice between the prepositional dative construction and the double object construction (the so-called “dative alternation”) with the verb give was influenced by (i) the discourse givenness and topicality of themes and recipients, (ii) the situational necessity of contrast, and (iii) the use of the expected construction by the child’s interlocutor (prompt). The results provide evidence for the role of all factors, showing that four-and-a-half-year-olds are sensitive to the distinction between topics and foci and are able to produce contrastive topicalization. Although children did not produce an adult-like rate of contrastive topicalization strategies (which is tentatively explained by their underuse of gapping constructions), they did reveal adult-like preferences with respect to the choice of a dative construction that better matches the context. Children’s sensitivity to contrast is evidenced by the fact that children more frequently employed contrastive topicalization strategies as conditions increasingly required so — as well as the fact that in the presence of contrastive topicalization, topics and foci alike were categorically expressed as full noun phrases rather than pronouns. The paper provides further evidence for children’s early pragmatic competence, especially active knowledge of contrastive topicalization, demonstrated in their adult-like, pragmatic-sensitive use of the dative alternation. This study thus contributes to the investigation of the interface between syntax and Information Structure in language acquisition.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002981/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002981<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>v1: manuscript; v2: BUCLD 41 Proceedings</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language acquisition, information structure, contrastive topicalization, focalization, dative alternation, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002981/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>894 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002981">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002981">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
