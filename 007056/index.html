The present article argues that the two positions must be treated not as alternatives but as contributing to a more realistic third alternative. 
At the centre of the argument is the conceptualization of the language user, identified as the average normal human adult whose linguistic experience, or E-language, is a reflection of the individual's complex and highly structured social life and communicative interactions at a  professional level, at a community level as a neighbour, a friend, a family member and as a fellow human. This is reflected in the complex nature of one's E-language, argued here to consist of  a combination of three subsystems, labeled here as  code-like system, inferential system  and protolanguage-like or  primitive/rudimentary language systems, existing in parallel in the adult mind.  
Starting from these theoretical stipulations  the article  argues that the innate propensity for learning and processing of  the very essentials of language, i.e. the most primitive  language systems, is more likely to reflect  the content of  the innate Language Faculty, while the other two subsystems reflect the  participation of a broad range of cognitive resources implicated to different degrees  in language learning and use. This novel interpretation  of key concepts in linguistics, i.e. the human language speaker, Language faculty, E-language, would be a valuable contribution to evolutionary linguistics in tracing the evolution of language.
