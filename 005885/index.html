This is a year-long introductory course that covers the main descriptive areas of language structure: morphology, syntax, semantics, phonetics, and phonology. In 2020-2021 it also included units on sociolinguistics, language acquisition (including language policy and revitalization), and language & music (the last not represented in the written topic guides). The weekly topic guides were written to accompany a series of content videos, which I have also made available online, as well as the open access textbook "Essentials of Linguistics" written by Catharine Anderson (https://essentialsoflinguistics.pressbooks.com/). 

Though the conditions under which this text was written means it doubtlessly contains many errors and omissions, I hope it and the accompanying videos may be useful to people teaching similar courses, whether in person or online. See the Preface of the full text for more detail and information about its contents. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005885/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005885<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>textbook, introductory linguistics, syntax, phonology, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005885/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3452 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005885">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005885">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
