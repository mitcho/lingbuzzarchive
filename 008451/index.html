One, especially associated with David Dowty, involves translating verbs using a set of precisely
interpreted primitive predicates such as cause and become, in order to facilitate semantic
generalizations such as patterns of entailment between sentences. Another, with multiple origins
in both temporal semantics and theories of the syntax/semantics interface (including, notably,
work by Pustejovsky and Piñón), involves developing a theory of the internal part structure of
the eventualities that verbs and other expressions describe; I refer to this approach, following
Pianesi and Varzi, as mereotopological. These two approaches to decomposition are not, strictly
speaking, incompatible, and they have sometimes been combined; however, perhaps surprisingly,
comparison of them has been unsystematic. I address this gap by describing more systematically
how the approaches differ from each other, illustrating with differences in the insights they offer
into specific aspects of the semantics of simple change of state verbs and unselected object
resultatives. I especially aim to promote interest in the development of more sophisticated,
cross-linguistically applicable theories of so-called event structure through appeal to a wider
range of notions from mereotopology.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008451/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008451<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Glossa</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>change of state, event semantics, event structure, inchoative verbs, lexical aspect, mereotopology, resultatives, semantic decomposition, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>444 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008451">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008451">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
