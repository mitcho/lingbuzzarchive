Māori has a range of verbal and non-verbal predicate constructions. I argue that, whilst subject topicalisation is generally permitted in all constructions, subject questioning is restricted (see Bauer 1993, 1997). More specifically, I claim that subject questioning is permitted in verbal and prepositional predicate constructions, but prohibited in nominal predicate constructions, all else being equal (see also de Lacy 1999). I review two existing types of analysis to account for this, which I refer to as the cleft + headless relative clause analysis and the complementary distribution analysis, pointing out various issues before proposing a novel analysis. I propose that Māori questions are cleft structures but ones where the embedded clause is a focus construction rather than a relative clause (see Belletti 2008, 2012, 2015). I also propose that subject questioning is prohibited in nominal predicate constructions due to intervention by the nominal predicate phrase. My analysis suggests that topicalisation and focus/question movement in Māori are triggered by A-features rather than A’-features. I discuss the use of A-features in formally encoding topicalisation and focus/questioning from an emergentist perspective, i.e. one where formal features are not innately pre-specified but rather emerge during language acquisition guided by the Third Factor cognitive bias to ‘Maximise Minimal Means’ (Biberauer 2017; Biberauer & Roberts 2015, 2017). *COMMENTS WELCOME!*<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003672/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003672<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>māori, subject extraction, topicalisation, questioning, focus, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>135 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003672">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003672">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
