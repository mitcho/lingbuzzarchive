In many of them, the speciﬁc agreement pattern is the following: one φ probe (in T) always agrees with the highest DPs in the clause, and another φ probe (in Voice/v) never agrees with that DP. Despite being well known, this alignment is not well understood in Bantu languages. It is typically taken for granted that it should be derivable either from probe-goal locality alone or from the interaction between agreement and case known to exist in other NOM/ACC languages. Based on data from Zimbabwean Ndebele, I demonstrate that independently known properties of Bantu languages make it very difficult to devise a locality-based or a case-based account of the NOM/ACC alignment in agreement in this language. I then develop an alternative analysis, which capitalizes on a fairly uncontroversial assumption about this language family: that φ-agreement systematically cooccurs with movement, implemented as obligatory cooccurrence of φ-probes with the EPP on functional heads. The key to deriving the facts from this parameter is to abandon the requirement that EPP and φ be satisﬁed by the same goal and instead allow them to probe blindly, obeying only locality, cyclicity, and probe ordering statements. With this adjustment, the φ → EPP parameter derives the NOM/ACC agreement alignment, and, as it turns out, a number of seemingly unrelated properties of Ndebele φ-agreement and A-movement: defective intervention effects in VSO clauses, the optionality of subject raising and agreement, agreement uniformity in auxiliary verb constructions, and an object agreement asymmetry in passives of ditransitives.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005254/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005254<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Working Papers in the Language Sciences at the University of Rochester</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agreement, a-movement, raising, argument alignment, epp, bantu, ndebele, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005254/v2.pdf">v2 [June 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005254/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>860 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005254">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005254">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
