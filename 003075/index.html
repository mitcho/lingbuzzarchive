We assume that the DOC has the format [ApplP Recipient [Appl’ Appl [VP  V  Theme]]]], where languages vary in the Case-assigning properties of Appl. In symmetrical languages Appl can assign Case to either Recipient or Theme. We propose that ApplP, not vP, is the lower, thematic phase in passives, as Appl is the highest functional thematic head introducing an argument, and that there is a single escape hatch from phases. In Theme passives, the Theme moves initially to the edge of ApplP, and subsequently to specTP. This blocks A-bar movement of the Recipient, which gets transferred along with the lower phase. In the Recipient passive, the Recipient moves to specTP before transfer of the lower phase, and the Theme argument remains accessible as it occupies the outer specifier of ApplP. The languages discussed include Norwegian, Northwest British English, Lubukusu, Zulu, Sesotho, and Italian.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003075/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003075<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Draft - comments very welcome!</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>keywords: passive, a-bar movement, phase theory, symmetry, double object construction, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003075/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1780 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003075">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003075">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
