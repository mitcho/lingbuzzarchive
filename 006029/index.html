Some other languages, including Russian, have been claimed to lack this degree constraint. This paper shows that while one can indeed exclaim strings like both 'How smart she is!' and 'Who came!' in Russian, there are two types of exclamations involving wh-items in Russian, Type 1 and Type 2, which have distinct form (in particular, prosody) and meaning (epistemic and affective), and Type 1 sentences are, in fact, subject to the degree constraint, while Type 2 sentences aren't. This paper proposes that Russian Type 1 sentences are instances of expressive degree intensification, with the expressive intensifier permanently promoted to the left periphery and its affect expression component, thus, being the primary speech act (cf. 'She's damn smart!' vs. 'Damn she's smart!' in English). Russian Type 2 sentences, in turn, involve embedding under a complex mirative predicate exponed primarily through prosody, which seems to be absent from the English lexicon. Thus, structurally, Russian 'Who came!' is akin to English '{Look / I can't believe / You won't believe} who came!'.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006029/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006029<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted to 'Proceedings of WCCFL 39' (preprint)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>exclamatives, degrees, expressives, expressive intensification, mirativity, prosody, semantics, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006029/v2.pdf">v2 [June 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006029/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>447 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006029">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006029">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
