My analysis covers a wide range of environments and constructions such as modal, non-modal and generic environments, strongly and weakly non-veridical environments, FCIs in contrastive topic and focus positions; and makes robust predictions concerning the behavior of FCIs under all of these environments. My main claim is that FCIs in Hungarian are dependent indefinites in the sense of Giannakidou (2001). This is corroborated by the results of the standard tests of quantificational force, and also the detailed analysis of the syntactic behaviour of FCIs in various constructions, accounting for word order and stress patterns and complex scope phenomena vis-a-vis various scope-bearing elements such as universal quantifiers, negation and focus. I show that FCIs in straight (modal) sentences occupy the positions standardly associated with universal quantifiers. In terms of universal vs. existential quantificational force, I show that FCIs display a quantificational plasticity standardly associated with indefinites, including dependent indefinites, using a battery of standard tests of quantification. I show that FCIs participate in negative concord, akin to universals and existentials. I provide an analysis of the behaviour of FCIs in contrastive topic position, and of the co-occurence of FCIs with the particle is ‘too, also’, consistent with the analysis of FCIs as dependent indefinites. I provide a detailed syntactic and semantic analysis of FCIs in focus position, utilizing standard assumptions concerning the identificational focus position in Hungarian and the dependent indefinite analysis of FCIs. I show that in Hungarian, a reading similar to free relatives with an FCI-flavour such wh-ever in English can be elicited by moving the FCI bárki ‘anyone’ into focus position. This indicates that there are two strategies crosslinguistically to encode the meaning associated with FCI free relatives: either to have a separate lexical item (e.g. wh-ever in English) or to utilize the interplay of the standard FCI (such as bárki ‘anyone’ in Hungarian) and a specific syntactic construction (such as the identificational focus construction) in a compositional manner. I provide a detailed account for the puzzling observation that a generic environment does not license FCIs in Hungarian (in contrast to several other languages). I argue that in any given language, there is a strong correlation between the (non)licensing of FCIs in a generic environment, the nature of genericity (semantic vs. pragmatic) and the formal semantics of individual-level predicates (Kratzer (1995) vs. Chierchia (1995)).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004490/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004490<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD Dissertation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>free-choice items; quantification; syntax–semantics interface; indefinites, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>220 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004490">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004490">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
