This version was presented at the Romanian Academy of Sciences in May 2024.  Perhaps I will write this up as an article in the future, but a number of people have found the slides themselves useful — especially for discussions with non-linguists — so I decided to post them here for the time being.

Note the acknowledgment in slide 29 to my own summary paper on <i>that</i>-trace effects in the second edition of the <i>Wiley Blackwell Companion to Syntax</i> (also available on LingBuzz), from which much of the data in these slides is taken unchanged.  Very little if anything in these slides will be new to knowledgable linguists (you have been warned!). The sole new point here is their relevance to the question asked in the title. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008494/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008494<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>slides from presentations at Romanian Academy of Sciences</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>llm, large language models, chatgpt, syntax, that-trace, birth, death, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>396 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008494">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008494">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
