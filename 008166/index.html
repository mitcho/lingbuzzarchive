The earlier literature has often expressed pessimism about identifying such elements across languages in an objective way, but I propose definitions that do not rely on notions such as “word” or “morphology”. I define incorporation as a special kind of verbal compound construction, and a compound construction as a combination of strictly adjacent roots. Rather than being “non-phrasal”, I say that compounds are defined as not expandable by modifiers. These definitions are shared-core definitions, like most other definitions of comparative concepts: They capture the core of the types of elements that have been called “compound” and “incorporation” in the earlier literature, but not necessarily every compound and every incorporation in every language.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008166/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008166<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>(submitted)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>compound, incorporation, root, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>291 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008166">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008166">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
