Instead, I propose a composition-driven, modality-neutral approach whereby which projection mechanisms are available or enforced for a given piece of compositionally integrated content, spoken or gestural, is determined by how it composes in the syntax/semantics. I adduce experimental data supporting this view from an acceptability judgement task comparing co-nominal gestures to adnominal adjectives and appositives. More broadly, this paper establishes the need to treat gestures as bona fide linguistic objects at all levels of representation in order to understand how they contribute to the meaning of utterances as well as which aspects of grammar are modality-(in)dependent.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004706/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004706<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of SALT 29</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>composition, projection, co-speech gestures, non-restricting modifiers, supplements, presuppositions, acceptability judgements, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004706/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>279 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004706">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004706">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
