The explanation of the nature of this observation has played a central role in neurolinguistic and psycholinguistic in the last thirty years. This paper proposes that this pattern can by the Relativized Minimality approach to locality given the natural assumption that agrammatics have trouble with the representation of scope-discourse related features. This approach presents considerable advantages from an empirical perspective and to be conceptually desirable from a theoretical perspective. Among the advantages, it is claimed to allow a better integration of these facts with other well-known asymmetries in agrammatic comprehension, such as those involving binding, and models that relate processing and representational accounts of their deficits.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002134/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002134<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Lingua</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>locality, relativized minimality, feature hierarchy, passives, aphasia, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2432 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002134">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002134">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
