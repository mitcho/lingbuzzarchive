tactic theory: in both constructions, the Case of the head noun affects the
form of a constituent within the relative clause. This leads to problems for
a bottom-up approach since the necessary information – the matrix Case –
is not available at the point where the Case of the relative pronoun is determined/the choice between gap and resumptive is made. In a standard system, rather radical and unattractive assumptions need to be made to account for the constructions. We propose an alternative account that rests on three crucial assumptions: (i) Case-Agree between the head noun and the relative operator in SpecC. (ii) Case probes can also be discharged under matching, viz., even if the goal DP has already been involved in Case-checking. (iii) Case features are decomposed. While the patterns as such can be derived in both bottom-up and top-down, we argue that top-down derivation is preferable because of one crucial advantage: the choice between gap and resumptive can be made locally while under bottom-up transderivational Economy is necessary.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002324/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002324<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Topics at InfL, 347–396 A.
