The most well-known exchange occurred in the early 1920s between Leon Trotsky and Victor Shklovsky, between a high government official of the Soviet regime and a leading member of the Society for the Study of Poetic Language. Was the discussion a harbinger of future Soviet policies? Interestingly, some of the objections voiced by government officials, at the time charged with overseeing cultural policy, are reflected in modern-day conceptions of Russian Formalism. An important question to consider is why a theory in poetics should have stirred the heated debate, about questions of ideology and art, in the first place.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003310/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003310<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>International Journal of Russian Studies</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>russian formalism, marxism, poetics, socialist realism, science, art, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>284 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003310">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003310">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
