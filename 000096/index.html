This is what I call  Creole Exceptionalism . In this paper, I select various patterns in morphology and word order in order to question Creole Exceptionalism. Take  discrepancies in one core domain of Creole genesis, namely VP-related morphosyntax. Are such discrepancies at all  exceptional ? I start with a sample of VP-related properties in Haitian Creole (HC) a bona  de Creole on sociohistorical grounds. I compare the morphosyntax of verbs and object pronouns in HC and in some of its major source languages. I also speculate on the development of said morphosyntax from the perspective of second- and first-language acquisition and the role of grammaticalization and reanalysis therein. This, in turn, leads me to examine various theoretical proposals on the morphology-syntax interface vis-a-vis verb and object placement in language change/creation, and to consider germane patterns in Germanic and French diachrony. I also compare the HC patterns with their counterparts from a couple of other Romance-lexifier Creoles, namely Cape Verdean Creole (lexifier: Portuguese) and Palenquero Creole (lexifier: Spanish). My conclusions are fourfold: (i) Even within a small sample of Romance-lexifier Creoles, there is no structural  Creole uniformity in the VP and its extended projections. (ii) Certain  discrepancies  in French and English diachrony seem as significant as their analogues in Creole diachrony. (iii) This paper's observations argue against the classic (e.g., Bickertonian) Pidgin-to-Creole scenarios whereby pidginization qua structural  break in transmission produces a macaronic and a xless pidgin that subsequently seeds a Creole qua ab novo creation. (iv) Similarly, there is little evidence from HC to support Lefebvre's relexification hypothesis whereby HC grammar would essentially reflect substratum grammar with the French contribution strictly limited to phonetic strings  deprived of [syntactic and semantic] features  and to word-order patterns in lexical projections only (Lefebvre 1998). The overall conclusion is that Creole languages do not constitute a well-delineated and exceptional class (i.e., there are no special diachronic processes of  creolization  and there is no distinct and uniform  Creole  typology):  creolization  and  language change  reflect processes of language development that are uniform across the species.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000096/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000096<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dm, creole, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1135 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000096">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000096">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
