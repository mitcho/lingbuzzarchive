This paper presents an analysis of ICA based primarily on novel fieldwork data from Koryak, a highly endangered Chukotko-Kamchatkan language of the Russian Far East.  The paper argues that Koryak relative clauses with inverse case attraction are actually surface-internally-headed, but their heads appear in the embedded left periphery, thereby instantiating a type of relative clause that has so far been argued to exist only in the Gur languages of West Africa. I show that there are syntactic parallels between Gur relative clauses and Koryak ICA, despite the fact that Gur languages have no morphological case marking. An important consequence of the relative clause being surface-internally-headed is that it becomes unsurprising that the head should be assigned its case inside the relative clause. This derives the unexpected case pattern in ICA while dispensing with case attraction as a morphosyntactic primitive. Implications for the raising analysis of relative clauses are also discussed. A survey of other languages with inverse case attraction suggests that internally-headed relative clauses with left-peripheral heads are likely to be a general solution to ICA across languages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006146/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006146<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>manuscript</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>inverse case attraction, relative clause, case, koryak, buli, uralic, ancient indo-european, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>424 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006146">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006146">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
