In the typology proposed by Nichols et al. (2004), Slavic languages are included into the class of detransitivizing languages. In other words, valency increase is not grammatically marked in this language group, whereas valency decrease has a regular grammatical expression (see Paduèeva (1998) on anticausative marking in Russian). More precisely, all Slavic languages employ the polysemous reflexive / reciprocal / anticausative marker going back to the Proto-Slavic reflexive pronoun (in Russian, this marker became the verbal suffix -sja) which fulfills numerous valency-decreasing functions.

However, in this paper I will pay attention to causative constructions in Russian. Of course, as most detransitivizing languages, Russian has means of expressing the causative meaning, albeit these means are lexical rather than grammatical. For instance, there are numerous verbs with the causative meaning, such as zastavit (perfective) / zastavljat (imperfective) make, vynudit (pf) / vynudat (ipf) force, pozvolit (pf) / pozvoljat (ipf) let, allow, razreit (pf) / razreat (ipf) permit, and so on.

My point is that the interpretation of tense / aspect forms is different depending on whether the causee is an agent or an event. The reason is that events are by default analyzed together with their results, which cannot be true for agents and other participants. These facts makes us think that the results achieved by Ramchand (2008 etc.) should be supplemented with additional mechanisms which make the 'result interpretation' possible.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001208/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001208<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Unpublished</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>causatives, causee, agentive causer, eventive causer, event structure, tense form, result, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001208/v1.doc">v1 [January 2011]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>584 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001208">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001208">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
