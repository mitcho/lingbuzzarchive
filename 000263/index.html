It involves the deletion of a relative clause with the exclusion of the relative pronoun and one more remaining constituent. We show that this construction should be analysed as an instance of sluicing. The theoretical  approach we provide for these sentences is an adapted version of Merchants (2001) implementation of sluicing in terms of an [E]-feature that is responsible for the deletion process. Our extension of this proposal involves the modification of the syntactic subcontent  of this [E]-feature. We show that languages where question words are found in the operator domain of the left periphery use a version of [E]-feature that attaches to heads whose specifier is occupied by an operator. This predicts that sluicing not only occurs with wh-remnants but  more widely with operator remnants as well. With this proposal we lay the foundation for a cross-linguistic taxonomy of sluicing constructions, and open new avenues for explaining root/embedded asymmetries in some as yet ill-understood elliptical phenomena in English.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000263/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000263<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sluicing, hungarian, focus, relatives, ellipsis, [e]-feature, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>809 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000263">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000263">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
