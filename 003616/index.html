The concept that brings the study of bilingualism and bimusicality together is that of convergence. PMN follows up on LCMC and a study on the contribution of Octavio Paz to the study of poetry and music (2014) that appeared in California Linguistic Notes, “Octavio Paz: 100 years,” and “New poetics in China” (2015) in Chinese Language and Discourse. As background to PMN, readers can look through these previous studies to get an idea of some of the main ideas of the project. Regrettably, PMN does not continue to take up in detail the review of research on one of the important topics of LCMC, mentioning it only in passing: the relationship between affective vocalization and music/poetry. LCMC makes reference to the work of D. Purves, A. Vouloumanos, and associates, on this relationship. Future discussion of this line of investigation (studies by M. Belyk and S. Brown to mention just two) is of central importance for understanding better the relationship between language and music..<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003616/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003616<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>The Linguistic Review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>tonality, bilingualism, cross-language interaction, convergence, faculty of music, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>123 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003616">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003616">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
