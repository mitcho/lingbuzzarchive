Using standard ideas of evolutionary stability in biology, we develop a simple framework (restricted to cooperative situations) to analyze the emergence of three meaning components: individual signals, non-trivial combinations, and pragmatic principles of competition among signals. We show that for elementary signals to arise, roughly, one of two things should be true: they had null cost, or they were understood from the start. While this largely dovetails with the traditional idea that signals often originate in cues, i.e. informative by-products of non-communicative processes, the two scenarios can be distinguished in case studies in which ancestral meanings were partly reconstructed. For non-trivial combinations, we start from two recent cases in which a sequence CC' was been argued not to be reducible to the separate utterance of C and then C'. One case (pyow-hack sequences in putty-nosed monkeys) was claimed to involve idioms, while the other (ABC-D sequences in Japanese tits) was argued to involve non-trivial compositionality. We show that the emergence of such non-trivial combinations is heavily constrained by the fact that they will initially give rise to miscommunication due to the possibility of treating C and C' as separate utterances; we take this to make certain idiom-based analyses implausible. Finally, for pragmatic principles, we study two principles that were proposed in recent animal linguistics, namely the Informativity Principle and the Urgency Principle. We argue that for both there is a clear evolutionary path, especially if they start appearing in production, and then in comprehension. Overall, we suggest that recent work in animal linguistics can be fruitfully combined with simple principles of evolutionary stability and, increasingly, with methods of ancestral signal reconstruction, to address in a precise fashion questions about the very first meaning operations that arose in nature.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008203/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008203<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>evolutionary animal linguistics, evolution of semantics, animal semantics, evolutionary biology, evolutionary game theory, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>289 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008203?_s=cAktRY9xPVsxaDW6&amp;_k=AdhvZcE3y66n5fmR&amp;11">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008203?_s=cAktRY9xPVsxaDW6&amp;_k=AdhvZcE3y66n5fmR&amp;12">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
