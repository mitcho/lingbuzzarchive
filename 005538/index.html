By combining data and analyses from contact linguistics, psychology, and cognitive science, this study provides an explicit and principled treatment of different phenomena of morphological transfer, showing that a demarcation reflects psycholinguistic facts, which, if analyzed properly, allow us to gain useful insights into synchronic bilingual processing and diachronic language change. In particular, it is claimed that morphological borrowing occurs via cross-language structural priming and that speakers have the ability to relate to the internal structure of words (‘morphological relatability’), which can interfere with the inhibitory control mechanism that preempts access to the non-targeted language, and override it, thereby enabling morphological priming. A large body of evidence, ranging from experimental psycholinguistics to language change and first language acquisition, underpins this assumption. Relatable morphology is claimed to be a precondition for morphological transfer and borrowing to occur, and a Stratal Effect is hypothesized, which, applying to varying extent, gives rise to at least three distinct types of morphological transfer. Finally, the mainstream view according to which affix borrowing can be either direct or indirect is dismissed, and it is shown that affix borrowing always involves an indirect process including extrapolation of relatable formatives and their diffusion within the lexicon.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005538/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005538<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>inhibitory control; language change; language contact; morphological borrowing; priming; processing, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>286 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005538">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005538">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
