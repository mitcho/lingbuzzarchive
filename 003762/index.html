We conducted an acceptability rating study of wh-islands and subject islands in Slovenian, using the factorial definition of island as developed in Sprouse et al. (2012) and other works. This definition provides for a capability to isolate a true island effect while controlling for two complexity factors that potentially interfere in speakers’ evaluation of the relevant sentences: the length of the respective movement dependency and the presence of an island structure itself. We found that 1) Slovenian speakers do judge the wh-island sentences worse than the respective controls, but the observed degradation cannot be attributed to a true island effect; 2) subject extraction out of a wh-island leads to a so called reverse island effect whereby the acceptability is higher than expected even if the above two complexity factors are taken into consideration; and 3) speakers are sensitive to the subject island effect, as predicted by the mainstream theories of syntactic locality. The results of our study contribute to establishing a solid empirical base for further theoretical investigations of the island effects, and raise new questions about the role of processing factors in speakers’ evaluation of island constructions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003762/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003762<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>2018 Linguistics 56(3): 435-476 (prepublication version)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntactic island, experimental syntax, subjacency, slovenian, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>871 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003762">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003762">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
