Contrary to this view, this paper presents novel grammatical arguments that wh-questions in CSE have arisen as the result of systemic substratal transfer from Baba/Bazaar Malay. The arguments are two-fold. First, CSE and Bazaar/Baba Malay both have partial wh-movement (the movement of a wh-phrase into an embedded sentence-initial position), unlike the Sinitic languages. Second, both CSE and Bazaar Malay disallow wh-in-situ for adverbial wh-phrases whereas the Sinitic languages allow such an option. I propose to analyze the observed pattern in terms of the CSE-internal micro-parametric restructuring with regards to the composition of wh-phrases in the lexical component under the pressure of Malay a la Cole and Hermon (1998). Specifically, in CSE, a wh-phrase can either consist of the interrogative operator and a wh-word in a single word, as in English, or simply in a wh-word base-generated separately from the interrogative operator, as in the Chinese languages. The proposed analysis also correctly predicts two other parallels between wh-questions in CSE and Bazaar Malay with regards to the island-sensitivity of movement and the non-interrogative use of wh-variables under quantificational contexts. These parallels confirm that the Malay influences on CSE wh-questions are systemic. The results reported in this paper are significant in two respects. First, evidence in favor of the Malay substrate hypothesis has thus far been merely based on the socio-history of the endogenous contact ecology of Singapore (Gupta 1994, 1998; Lim 2007; Low and Brown 2005). The paper presents the first strictly grammatical evidence in favor of this hypothesis. Second, the results of the paper suggest, in view of the overwhelming typological congruence between Malay and Chinese, that 1) the Sinitic influences on the grammar of CSE have been somewhat overstated in the literature, and that 2) only a much finer-grained structural analysis of the differences behind the similarities in these languages can shed light on the identity of primary substratal languages of CSE and the genesis of this contact variety, more generally.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001234/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001234<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001234">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001234</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under second rounds of review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>wh-questions, partial wh-movement, wh-in-situ, singapore english, bazaar malay, substratist explanation, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>536 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001234">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001234">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
