Indo-European morphological case systems exhibit considerably more syncretism between nominative and accusative cases than between other pairs of cases. This reflects the fact that the two case-assigning categories for nominative and accusative, namely the finiteness constituent I and the lexical verb, are facets of the same basic category, call it simply V. That is, I = V, +I and the verb = V, –I. Assuming further that case morphemes are simply “Alternative Realizations” of the case assigners, then a nominal projection with an alternatively realized V-feature that lacks further specification as either +I (nominative) or –I (accusative) has a neutralized case, called here “Super Case”.
The paper analyses a range of morphological case regularities of Romanian, Latin,German and Czech and demonstrates show that an undifferentiated “V-case” playsa central role in these four quite different systems. Consequently, the four basic cases of Government and Binding research actually reduced to three, V-case (Super Case),N-case (genitives) and P-case (obliques, i.e. dative, ablative, instrumental, etc.).
Further, investigation shows that so-called neuter gender in Latin, German and
Czech is a name for a subset of masculine inanimate nouns which have a special relationto V-case but are otherwise regular. Lexical entries of neuter noun stems in Latinand German have an inherent V-case feature, which makes suffi xal case morphemes redundant on both Latin nouns and German singular determiners. The traditional classificatory terminology in Czech is reversed, in that its regular masculine inanimates are those traditionally terms neuters (aut- “car”, masl- “butter”). While its masculine inanimate nouns that carry an inherent V-case feature, making redundant (similar to Latin neuters) any special V-case suffixes, are those called “masculine inanimates” (hrad “castle”, most “bridge”). “castle”, most “bridge”).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003588/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003588<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Karlík a továrna na lingvistiku.
