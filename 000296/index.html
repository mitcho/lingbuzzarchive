I focus on three broad domains: the upper, middle and lower areas of clause structure which roughly correspond to the A-bar, A, and theta-positions of Government and Binding theory, and their corresponding heads, C, T and V. Following the general format of this volume, the initial sections are intended as a (selective) reading of recent work on this topic, and I use and extend the conclusions from this in the final section. 

I argue that the 'semantics' of finiteness should be divorced from subject licensing, and show that tense and agreement features are independently responsible for subject licensing, and the effects of this can be seen when the C layer is removed, truncating the clause at TP.   I provide a particularly radical case of this kind of truncation in Gaelic, where the clause can be truncated at the VP level. In this case too, though, subjects can be licensed in a way that depends on the formal features T and Agr. This strongly argues for divorcing subject licensing from the interpretable feature [finite]. 



I argue, in line with expectations, that there is no clear mapping from the traditional notion of finiteness to the categories of formal grammar. There are phenomena, and there are attempted explanations of those phenomena which are embedded within a theoretical system. Typically the terms in which the explanation is couched will be far removed from the terms in which the original phenomenon was described, and I believe this is the case for finiteness.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000296/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000296<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Nikolaeva (ed) 'Finiteness: Theoretical and Empirical Foundations' OUP</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>finiteness, control, gaelic, case, subect licensing, syntax, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1824 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000296">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000296">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
