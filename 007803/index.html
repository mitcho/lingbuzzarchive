In the first sections, some basic properties of particles are introduced. Section 6 begins with the argument that particles are not adverbs or other adjuncts but functional heads constitutive of the phrase structure. The central part is Section 7, which develops the syntactic-semantic part on the basis of modern particles in W-questions. Particles appear as heads of a particle phrase in which their scopus is irreversibly fixed. In addition, there is a parallel syntax in German, but also in many other languages, in which particles can combine with subsentential XPs. The "small particle phrases" resulting from this connection are something like W-operators or negative quantifiers. They are managed accordingly in the specifier of the particle phrase of the sentence and obtain their propositional scopus from there. As will be explained in Sec-tion 8, this results in a dual system whose parts interlock ideally. The apparent complexity of the system proves to be simple and conclusive in the deconstruction presented here. The theory makes do with the standard assumptions of minimalist syntax. 
There are no stipulations. The article concludes with a demonstration of potential word order aphorisms, which are elegantly resolved in the proposed system. It is shown that the theory of particles as functional heads developed here assigns particles a central position in syntax. The previously often claimed marginality of modal particles in particular can hardly be said to exist any more.
