In this article, I will challenge this analysis by taking a close look at German as well as more briefly at modern Indo-Aryan as an example of more strictly head-final languages. The result of my investigation will be that particles have head status, more precisely the status of functional heads. It will be shown that under this assumption many of the key properties of particles fall into place, and that the adverb theory is unlikely to derive these properties in an explanatory way. The article is organized as follows: Section 2 will refer to proposals of the recent past: a. the so-called Particle Theory (PT) and b. the so-called Mixed Theory (MT); and it will pin down problems these theories give rise to. Section 3, the central part, will defend a theory according to which particles are functional heads which project features but cannot project a syntactic category. In this section, the technical side of the head theory will be introduced, and its advantages will be discussed. In section 4, comparative support for the head theory will be presented. A conclusion will follow in section 5.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004070/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004070<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>discourse particles; adverbs; head; adjunction, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>331 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004070">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004070">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
