We begin by presenting a revised analysis of the copula-construction analysis of Hatakeyama (1997), positing movement of the copula verb to Fin0, instead of C0. We then consider cases of copula omission which are internal to the second clause of comparative correlative constructions, such as in the more difficult the problem (is), the more tired the student (is).  We argue that the copula in these sentences moves to Fin0, and subsequently undergoes PF ellipsis.  We further extend this analysis of the copula to the copula that sits in between the clauses in comparative correlatives (e.g. the more we eat is the happier we become), which is optionally overt in Jamaican English but covert in Standard English. We argue that this second case of the copula undergoes exactly the same syntactic operation as the first, moving to Fin0. We thus establish that comparative correlatives derive from a predication built from the so-called reversed comparative correlative (e.g. We become happier the more we eat), using den Dikkenâ€™s (2006) predicate-inversion analysis and its null functional head.  Overall, we argue that the comparative correlative is, from a larger perspective, an inverse copula construction.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001694/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001694<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>unpublished</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>finiteness, specificational copular sentences, comparative correlative, generic sentences, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001694/v1.doc">v1 [December 2012]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2260 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001694">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001694">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
