notion of movement. Still very little is known about how movement develops 
over time in child language, or, cross-linguistically, how its rate of development is pegged to languages with rich morphologies. Researchers of child language acquisition have long noted that children pass through developmental stages of grammatical morphology, with the early multi-word stage showing ‘variable’ and ‘optional’ production rates of morpho-syntactic inflection. Accounts range in the literature from phonological deficits, where prosodic development may be a factor, to semantic or syntactic under-representations, where features may go unspecified. Specifically, one current syntactic model suggests that such variable delays are, to a large degree, ‘optional’ due to incomplete inflectional representations of features (Wexler, 1994). While we are in agreement with the general account that Wexler lays out for us, we ague contra Wexler from our own previous work done showing that there exists an even earlier stage during which children have complete ‘non-access’ to inflectional morphology<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008226/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008226<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>merge-based theory of child language acquisition, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>178 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008226">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008226">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
