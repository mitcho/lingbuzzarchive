One of them is the alternation between verbal agreement paradigms common in Algonquian languages: SIMPLE vs. COMPLEX agreement (traditionally Conjunct Order and Independent Order), and the other is the distribution of Verb Second (V2) in Germanic. The basic Algonquian pattern uses COMPLEX agreement (characterized by an agreement proclitic) as the default, with SIMPLE agreement (that lacks the proclitic) being restricted to a small “marked” set of clauses. We focus primarily on Arapaho (Plains Algonquian) as an outlier within its language family – it uses SIMPLE agreement as the default and COMPLEX agreement as the “marked” paradigm, comparing it to English and its “Residual V2” pattern of Aux-C inversion. We argue that the similarities between the two “residual” patterns are not coincidental and reveal a deeper parallelism: the distribution of V2 in Germanic and the SIMPLE/COMPLEX alternation in Algonquian stem from the same requirement of the verb to move to C only in some syntactic environments. The main difference is that in Algonquian V-C movement feeds the realization of additional C-related agreement. This allows us to extend Richards’s (2004) analysis of the agreement alternation in Wampanoag (Eastern Algonquian) to both the “basic Algonquian” and Arapaho patterns by treating the former as the Algonquian equivalent of “canonical V2” and the later as “Residual V2”.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003472/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003472<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in "Proceedings of NELS 47"</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>verb movement, v-c movement, agreement, typology, verb second, v2, residual v2, inversion, conjunct order, independent order, algonquian, arapaho, germanic, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003472/v2.pdf">v2 [July 2017]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003472/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2017]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>665 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003472">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003472">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
