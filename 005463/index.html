<ol>
	<li>To&nbsp;show what a system of configurational case assignment would look like when formulated in current syntactic terms (rather than the GB terms in which it was originally proposed, e.g. in Marantz's 1991 paper).</li>

	<li>To&nbsp;show that given&nbsp;(1), the proposal in Baker's (2015) book, to&nbsp;add case-assignment-under-phi-agreement to a configurational case system, is&nbsp;an empirically vacuous&nbsp;one. Everything it&nbsp;can account for can also be accounted for under a purely configurational system as construed in&nbsp;(1), with no appeal whatsoever to phi-features within the theory of case.</li>

	<li>To&nbsp;argue that the system in&nbsp;(1) is therefore sufficient to account for case, cross-linguistically. It is also necessary, in the sense that theories with no dependent-case component are unable to serve as general theories of case.</li>

	<li>To&nbsp;remind ourselves that one cannot argue against&nbsp;(3) by, e.g., presenting a language in which the-case-pretheoretically-identified-as-'accusative' doesn't conform to the predictions of dependent case. That would only work if descriptive labels like 'accusative' were guaranteed to carve out a natural class of grammatical phenomena, but there is no reason to believe that they&nbsp;do.</li>
