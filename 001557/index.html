Under the model of generative grammar, we examine ellipsis of different syntactic categories. It is concluded that only empty DP and CP constituents are referential, denoting references in certain syntactic configurations. Other constituents like VP and NP are not so much referential and their ellipsis can be derived by the rules of PF deletion. This distinction is attributed to the reasoning that “items/individuals” and “propositions” are more likely to denote referential entities. They are, thus, more likely to appear in pro-form or Pro in natural languages. Other elements like properties, events, or descriptions are prone to be generated in the PF component.

The organization of this thesis is as follows. Chapter 1 is a review of the literature. We discuss three families of analyses, as well as ellipsis of different categories – NP (Wasow1972; Saito & Murasugi 2004), VP (Zagona1998), IP (Merchant 2001; CLM 1995), and others. This discussion is followed by a review of Chinese empty nominals (Huang 1984; Xu 1986; Li 2007), empty pro-forms (Lobeck 1995; Li 2008), and deletion (Merchant 2001; Aelbrecht 2009). Chapter 2 discusses the empty phrasal category of NP. The discontinuous empty phrasal categories suggest an account of PF deletion inside the Chinese DP. Chapter 3 analyzes the ellipsis of light verb complements. It is argued that VP is the deletion domain and PF deletion is the way to derive it. Light-verb-stranding VPE is attested in Chinese. Chapter 4 discusses the non-existence of IP-sized empty categories. The apparent sluicing constructions are accounted for by either wh-predication to an empty subject pro, or deletion within the pseudo-cleft construction. Chapter 5 analyzes tag questions. Two types of tag questions indicate the existence of to empty categories of CPs, and their properties are examined. Chapter 6 concludes the thesis.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001557/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001557<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>2011, PhD dissertation, National Tsing Hua University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ellipsis, sluicing, np ellipsis, vp ellipsis, tag question, chinese syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>338 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001557">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001557">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
