Some researchers have argued that passive is in fact a misnomer and that the construction should instead be analyzed as an active one, with a nominative pro. This paper argues instead in favor of a minimalist analysis, where the New Passive is closely related to the impersonal P-passive (with a PP, type then was shouted at us), which is highly common and productive in Icelandic. On the approach pursued, ACC-to-NOM conversion involves case-star deletion, absent from the New Passive (much as from so-called psych and fate (un)accusatives in standard Icelandic). In addition, the New Passive has a strong vP phase edge, blocking A-movement, in contrast to the defective vP edge in the canonical passive. The paper argues that A-grounding or freezing is brought about by &#61546;-minimality, A-islands thus arising in a parallel fashion as A'-islands.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000953/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000953<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Syntax 14:148-178</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>a-movement, case, passive, voice, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000953/v3.pdf">v3 [June 2011]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000953/v2.pdf">v2 [November 2009]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000953/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2009]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1534 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000953">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000953">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
