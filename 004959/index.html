Cross-linguistically, this is a rather uncommon strategy as comparable VP-fronting constructions in e.g. Hebrew, Polish, and Portuguese, among many others, exhibit verb doubling. Discussing several recent approaches to verb doubling showing that they all involve VP-evacuating head movement of the verb and subsequent deletion of the (low copy of) VP, I conclude that this derivation, and therefore verb doubling, should in principle also be available in Germanic where V-to-C movement provides the necessary VP-evacuating head movement of V. After discussing and rejecting some alternative explanations for the lack of verb doubling I propose that it is the result of a bleeding interaction between V-to-C movement and VP-to-SpecCP-movement, i.e. the fact that both movement operations are triggered by the same head C. The resulting prediction that verb doubling should result if there is independent V-to-T movement seems to be borne out. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004959/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004959<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>verb doubling, head-movement, vp-topicalization, germanic, verb second, v-to-t movement, v-to-c movement, scandinavian, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>73 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004959">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004959">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
