Because in classical approaches only items below the skeleton have phonetic properties that according to SFP need to be expunged, to date work in SFP only ever concerns segmental aspects. If substance is removed from segmental representation and primes and computation are therefore arbitrary, the non-trivial question arises how such a system can communicate with a system where primes and computation are not arbitrary (at and above the skeleton). The two phonologies below and at / above the skeleton that exist in production are complemented with a third phonology that occurs upon lexicalization, i.e. when L1 learners or adults transform the acoustic signal into a stored representation. Finally, the core of the article argues that this broad architecture is inhabited by three distinct computational systems along the classical feature geometric divisions: Son(ority) is located at and above the skeleton, while Place and Lar(yngeal) live below the skeleton. A non-trivial question is then how a multiple-module spell-out works, i.e. how ingredients from three distinct vocabularies can be mapped onto a single phonetic item. It is argued that the skeleton plays a central role in this conversion.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005484/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005484<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>special issue on substance-free phonology, to be published by the Canadian Journal of Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>substance-free phonology, syllable structure, intra-phonological modularity, intermodular communication, sonority, place, manner, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>409 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005484">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005484">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
