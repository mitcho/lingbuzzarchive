Disyllabic Norwegian words characteristically have an initial syllable which is stressed and heavy and a final syllable which is unstressed and light, (Kristoffersen 2000). Adopting a moraic theory of syllabic representation, the weight of the initial syllable can be realized either with a bimoraic vowel or with a monomoraic vowel followed by a moraic consonant. Monosyllabic words also show variation in the length of the vowel and the coda consonant, (Behne, Czigler, and Sullivan 1998b,a). Stress can be assigned to both the disyllabic and monosyllabic patterns by constructing a trochaic; the core patterns are equally well predicted by constructing such a foot at either the right or left edge of the word, and indeed both analyses have been advocated (Rice 2003; Kristoffersen 2003). The stress patterns of loanwords, however, reveal additional details about the assignment of stress, and sort out some unresolvable ambiguities arising when just considering the native vocabulary. These facts form the basis for advocating a right-edge oriented analysis of stress in Norwegian. Of particular interest here are two patterns revealed in the disyllabic loans, both of which have final stress. Only one of thesewords with final closed syllablescan be derived with the same grammar as the native vocabulary. The other patternwords with stress on a final, open syllableis incompatible with the native grammar. Lexically specified vowel length on the final syllable in the input is demonstrated to be an untenable solution, since the Richness of the Base hypothesis requires that inputs with long vowels in their final syllables be mapped by the grammar for the native vocabulary onto well-formed outputs, that is, onto forms with non-final stress. Two competing analyses are presented an evaluated, one with lexically specified stress and one in which the entire grammar is restructured in a way accounting for native and loanwords alike..<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000067/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000067<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>lingua 116:1171-1194</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>stress, restructuring, norwegian, loanword, grammaticalization, syllable structure, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>462 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000067">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000067">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
