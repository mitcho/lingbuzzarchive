Day 1 recaps basic topics like mereology, the singular-plural distinction, the count-mass distinction, higher-order properties, extensive and intensive measure functions, the telic-atelic opposition, and aspectual composition. Day 2 introduces stratified reference and is devoted to issues in the domain of measurement, such as the difference between 'thirty liters of water' and '*thirty degrees Celsius of water'. Day 3 is about differences within the class of collective predicates, as exemplified by the contrast between 'all the students gathered' and '*all the students were numerous'. Day 4 reformulates distributivity operators, extends them to the temporal domain, and explains why indefinites in the syntactic scope of 'for'-adverbials tend not to covary. Day 5 is devoted to the crosslinguistic semantic differences between distance-distributive items such as English 'each' and German 'jeweils' and to the interaction of distributive determiners like 'every' with cumulative readings.

Basic familiarity with formal semantics and mereology, as presented in my previous introductory ESSLLI and LSA course “Linguistic applications of mereology" https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002174, or in the review article Champollion & Krifka 2016 (Mereology, https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139236157.014) will be helpful.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006071/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006071<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>ESSLLI 2021</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>distributivity, aspect, measurement, mereology, algebraic semantics, plurals, mass terms, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1368 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006071">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006071">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
