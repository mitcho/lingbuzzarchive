Furthermore, there is a growing consensus that more than one structural element can be the source of the valued features, and that the structurally higher element tends to be responsible for the semantically informed value (for instance, √ and n in Kramer 2009, see Pesetsky 2013 and Landau 2016 for related configurational analyses). Yet it is far from clear what it means for features to be valued from the ‘context,’ and why the structural height of functional heads should make a difference with respect to whether or not a syntactic feature is going to be semantically interpreted.
This paper brings into the debate new data from Standard Italian and uses it to argue for a novel treatment of semantically interpretable φ-features, specifically gender. 
The paper has two parts. The first part presents an explicit Distributed Morphology model of Italian nominal morpho-syntax. I provide evidence that Italian nouns come in three distinct flavors, with one group being lexically specified for gender from the lexicon, and the other two unspecified. I show that type of gender specification has morpho-syntactic consequences. The first part of the paper provides the necessary groundwork for the main theoretical proposal presented in section 2. Section 2 elaborates on recent insights of phase theory (Chomsky 2001, 2008, 2013, Narita 2011) and insights of the formal semantic literature on the interpretation of gender features on pronouns (Heim 2008, Sudo 2012, among others). The section argues for a novel model of feature valuation in the syntax-semantic interface and explores under what circumstances a syntactic feature may be semantically interpretable. I argue that the morphology interface accesses the narrow syntax representation at two different temporal points of the derivation within a phase: the earlier point – technically, Spell-Out – returns a morphological realization that is faithful to feature values present in narrow syntax, while the later point – technically, Transfer – allows for a narrow syntax representation to be enriched by the CI component. Thus, there is no syntactic distinction between interpretable and uninterpretable features: a syntactic feature appears to be interpretable only if it has been licensed by CI. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003219/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003219<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phi-features, syntax-semantics interface; phases, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>863 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003219">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003219">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
