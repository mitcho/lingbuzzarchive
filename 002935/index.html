Lyman's Law blocks rendaku when the second member already contains a voiced obstruent (/oo/ + /tokage/ → */oo+dokage/, /oo+tokage/ ‘big lizard’). Lyman’s Law, as a constraint which prohibits a morpheme with two voiced obstruents, is also known to trigger devoicing of geminates in loanwords (e.g. /beddo/ → /betto/ ‘bed’). Rendaku and Lyman’s Law have been very well studied in the past phonological literature. Inspired by recent work that shows the interplay between orthographic factors and grammatical factors in shaping our phonological behaviors, this paper proposes a rather radical alternative interpretation of rendaku and Lyman’s Law. Concretely, I argue that they operate over Japanese orthography. Rendaku is a process to assign dakuten diacritics, and Lyman’s Law prohibits morphemes with two diacritics. The paper shows that various properties of rendaku and Lyman’s Law follow from this proposal.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002935/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002935<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>rendaku, lyman's law, japanese, orthotactics, devoicing, opacity, underspecification, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>162 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002935">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002935">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
