On the other hand, it is well known that inflectional morphology is organized into paradigms. This paper contributes to the convergence between inflection and derivation by offering a new paradigmatic model of derivational morphology. This model, called ParaDis, is based on two types of objects, families and paradigms, and on an architecture made up of three levels of representation (formal, categorical and semantic) and a morphological level, which connects the other three. Morphological descriptions are distributed at three levels, where they organize into formal, categorical and semantic families and paradigms. In this way, the analysis of a phenomenon adjusts closely to its level-specific regularities. The paper describes ParaDis and shows how it can be used to analyze a wide range of canonical and non-canonical derivational constructions in a simple and intuitive way. It compares ParaDis to five frameworks (Bochner, 1993; Bonami & Strnadová, 2019; Booij, 2010; Jackendoff & Audring, 2020b; Koenig, 1999) and illustrates its contributions through the analysis of parasynthetic derivatives.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006389/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006389<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Morphology (2022) 32:153–195 https://doi.org/10.1007/s11525-021-09390-w</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>derivational paradigm, morphological families, multilevel descriptions, paradigm superposition, non-canonical phenomena, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006389/v2.pdf">v2 [January 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006389/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>489 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006389">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006389">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
