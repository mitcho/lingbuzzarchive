disjunctive sentences, and consequences for the understanding of the
∃/∀ ambiguity observed with donkey anaphora. The primary focus is on donkey disjunctions, which are sentences where a (negated) existential in an initial disjunct appears to bind a pronoun in a later disjunct, such as "Either there's no bathroom, or its upstairs". The main empirical focus is that donkey disjunctions, like donkey anaphora, exhibit the ∃/∀ ambiguity, and more generally oscillate between homogeneous and heterogeneous readings in a context-sensitive fashion. The paper then proceeds in two steps: first, a principled analysis of donkey disjunctions is developed in the context of a Bilateral Update Semantics (BUS). BUS, by default, generates heterogeneous readings for donkey anaphora/donkey disjunctions (i.e., ∃ readings, in a positive context). In order to account of homogeneous readings, the conjecture is that sentences may be interpreted exhaustively relative to their negations. This has non-trivial consequences due to the non-classicality of BUS - specifically, a failure of the Law of Non-Contradiction.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007629/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007629<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of SALT 33 (to appear)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dynamic semantics, update semantics, donkey anaphora, homogeneity, negation, disjunction, non-classical logic, de morgan’s laws, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>151 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007629">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007629">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
