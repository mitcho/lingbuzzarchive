On the one hand, Kayne (2010) has challenged the long held view, dating back to Klima (1964), that relative 'that' in English is a complementizer, arguing instead that it is a relative pronoun. In contrast, Pesetsky
and Torrego (2006) argue that even (simplex) wh-relativizers, like 'who' and 'which' in English, are agreeing complementizers (see also Thornton and Crain 1994, Thornton 1995, Crain and Thornton 1998). Similarly, Bayer (2014:23) argues for Bavarian that “word-size wh-operators have syntactic as well as phonological properties of functional heads rather than genuine phrases”, and that “wh-words embrace the role of the complementizer”. Starting from some basic, though not much discussed, asymmetries between two sets of so-called relative pronouns in German, the novel claim I put forward is that the relativizer welch-, commonly rendered as 'who' or 'which' in English, is in fact a (agreeing) complementizer and not a relative pronoun, on a par with other simplex wh-elements, most notably 'was/wo', in (varieties of) German (Bayer 1984, 2002a,b, van Riemsdijk 1989, and references therein), and
'who' and 'which' in English (Pesetsky and Torrego 2006). Consequently, I argue for the fluidity of syntactic categories within a functional domain (specifically, the C-domain). Crucially, the analysis I put forth is only compatible with a non-head-raising analysis of relative clauses, whether in its external head variety, as assumed in Heim and Kratzer (1998) among others, or the matching analysis.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005681/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005681<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Bhatt, Rajesh; Frana, Ilaria; and Menéndez-Benito, Paula, "Making Worlds Accessible.
