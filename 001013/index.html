In this work, I illustrate one such consequence,

namely the rise of crossing and nesting movement dependencies and their reflexes. In particular, I make a case for the existence of massive RM that involves entire clausal subtrees in Polish. The analysis provides a uniform solution to three robust puzzles in the Polish OVS construction in a straightforward way.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001013/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001013<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of NELS 40 (2013), pp. 253-264</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>remnant movement, paths, functional sequence, binding, wco, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>665 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001013">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001013">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
