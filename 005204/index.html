This goal is divided into two subgoals based on empirical and computational questions. 

On the empirical side, I show that Armenian requires a model of the morphology-phonology interface which is interactionist and cyclic, i.e., that morphological structure, prosodic structure, and phonological rules cyclically interact to create new words. Evidence for this nuanced organization comes from the stratal phonology of Armenian (cf. Lexical Phonology and Stratal OT: Kiparsky 1982; Bermúdez-Otero 2018). There are phonological processes which apply differently before derivational morphology than in inflectional morphology. The main process that I examine is destressed high vowel reduction. This and other processes indicate not only different strata or levels, but also show signs of unbounded cyclicity and sensitivity to sublexical prosodic constituents, i.e., the Prosodic Stem (Downing 1999). These processes are active in both simplex and compound words. Within compounds, the interaction of all these factors creates bracketing paradoxes. I solve these paradoxes using a mixture of cyclic prosodic phonology and Head-Operations (Hoeksema 1988). I show that counter-cyclic approaches to bracketing paradoxes, like Morphological Merger or Rebracketing (Marantz 1988), are inadequate because they contradict the rest of Armenian phonology. 

There are many different incarnations of cyclic theories of phonology but there are little to no computational analyses of them. I develop an extensive computational formalization for cyclic or interactionist phonology by using Monadic-Second Order (MSO) logic, specifically graph-to-graph logical transductions. Logic is a flexible tool that lets us create iconic formalizations which faithfully replicate phonological theory. I utilize logical transductions as a way to encode the derivational nature of phonology. The formalism is a generalization of the work from one-level Declarative Phonology (Bird 1995; Coleman 1998) to a two-level framework. By formalizing the morphology, prosody, and phonological rule domains, I uncover implicit factors within cyclic phonology. The ultimate takeaway is that I show that the bulk of the morphology-phonology interface requires local computation, not global computation. By being local, the computational nature of the morphology-phonology interface opens doors to understanding how we can provably learn morpho-phonological processes and how these processes relate to limitations on human cognition (cf. Heinz 2018).
