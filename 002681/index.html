I argue for the presence of an implicit focus sensitive operator E akin to overt 'even', which has previously been proposed to combine with certain NPIs and minimizers. My argument is based on empirical and theoretical considerations: the E operator hypothesis correctly predicts that the domain for the scalarity effect does not depend on the position of 'propre' and that the simultaneous presence of overt focus particles gives rise to intervention effects; this hypothesis is moreover economical since it makes it possible to provide a single lexical entry for 'propre' under all its readings and to analyze all cases of scalarity effect by using a single mechanism, namely E. Furthermore, I argue that the association between E and the focused possessive DP containing 'propre' is pragmatic. It is because 'propre' is a maximizer of possessive relation - i.e. it characterizes the possessive relation it modifies as most specific - that it is relevant in the association with E of the focused DP containing it: the possessum is ranked higher than its alternatives on the scale of relational specificity introduced by 'propre', and this scale pragmatically correlates with the scale of unexpectedness required by the semantics of E. In sum, the case of 'propre' supports the existence of E on new empirical ground and thus clarifies the pragmatic conditions giving rise to it.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002681/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002681<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>NLLT 34-3 (2016)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>scalarity, operator e, possessive relation, 'even', focus, relevance, minimizer/maximizer</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002681/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1221 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002681">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002681">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
