The strong version of the Person Case Constraint prevents 1st and 2nd person phonologically weak direct objects from co-occurring with phonologically weak indirect objects of any person (1st, 2nd or 3rd). According to the weak version of the Person Case Constraint, combinations of 1st and 2nd indirect and direct objects are licit; 1st and 2nd person weak direct objects are ruled out only in the presence of 3rd person weak indirect objects. The paper proposes an account for the two constraints in terms of Checking Theory. It is argued that both constraints arise when two objects enter a feature checking relation with one and the same functional head, namely transitive v. In these configurations, high indirect objects move to transitive v first, followed by movement of direct objects. In languages with the strong version of the constraint indirect objects check person on transitive v, and direct objects can only check the remaining number features of v resulting in a person restriction. Languages with the weak version of the Person Case Constraint have the additional option of Multiple Agree, i.e. the person feature of transitive v can be checked simultaneously against the indirect and the direct object. The inappropriate combination 3rd IO> 1st, 2nd DO is argued to result from a restriction against conflicting feature specifications in Multiple Agree constructions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000062/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000062<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in L.
