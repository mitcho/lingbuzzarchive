developed according to which these constructions basically emerge from
the co-occurrence of (i) passivization and (ii) restructuring in the
language. Based on Mueller (2016; 2017) I
assume that passivization and restructuring both involve an operation
of structure removal in the course of the derivation -- of an external
argument DP in the first case, and of CP and TP layers of an
infinitive in the second case. The null hypothesis that I would like
to pursue against this background is that a combination of the two
structure removal operations gives rise to the intricate properties of
long-distance passives in German.  A core feature of the analysis is
that it does not involve any long-distance relation at any point;
argument demotion, case assignment, and morphological realization as
passive all take place extremely locally. Another basic property of
the structure removal approach, which sets it apart from most other
analyses, is that all DP arguments selected by the verbs involved
(including in particular external arguments in the embedded and matrix
domains) can be assumed to be structurally represented at some point
of the derivation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004521/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004521<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms. </td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>passive, restructuring, german, structure removal, exfoliation, pruning, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>200 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004521">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004521">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
