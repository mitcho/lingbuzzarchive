The empirical issues addressed are as follows. First,  some object pronouns are always overtly realised while others are always null. The aim was to provide a unified analysis of their distribution.  Second,  while Akan has been argued to have resumption for both subjects and objects in various A-bar constructions, only A-bar extracted object arguments yield an independent resumptive pronoun; a subject resumptive element is a bound form. Furthermore,  extracted local subject arguments always permit a default subject prefix in the extraction site. The aim was to provide a re-analysis of the empirical facts, to the effect that the subject case cannot be considered as a resumptive pronoun.  Third, it has been long observed that in Gã and several other Kwa languages, a determiner-like element shows up in complement clauses (CPs) from which A-bar extraction has taken place. It turns out that morphologically-similar functional elements are found in relative clauses and subject CPs, as well as adverbial clauses like conditional and time clauses when they occur to the left of a matrix clause. The aim was to account for the uniform behaviour of constructions which have this determiner-like element.
 In chapter  2, I argue that object pronouns that are always overtly realised, as in (a) those that precede an adverbial in (what looks like a) clause-final position, (b) when they occur as the object argument of a change of state predicate, (c) when they occur as the only argument of a depictive (secondary) predicate, and (d) when they are animate, are pronounced in a specifier position in the structure. For object pronouns that are null on the surface, however,  the proposed analysis suggests that their phonological contents are deleted in a complement position in the VP. Furthermore, I demonstrate that the predictions of the analysis are borne out in several other languages.
 I argue in chapter 3 that contrary to claims by previous authors,  Akan has no subject resumptive pronouns, and that what have been hitherto analysed as such can easily be accounted for as realisations of phi agreement on the  T(ense) head, which is realised on the verb. This is argued to result from a configuration in which a phi element stranded by an A-bar-marked element moves to spec, TP. This is the mechanism that is responsible for the cases of full phi agreement described above. On the other hand, when the A-bar-marked element moves to spec, TP, this results in lack of agreement, necessitating the insertion of a default marker.   The difference between local and embedded subject extraction is argued to be as a result of the lack of an A-bar projection in the embedded context, presumably to avoid the A-bar element from freezing clause-medially. I also demonstrate that the formal mechanism that derives the agreement affects in resumption constructions is also able to account for what looks like default agreement in non-A-bar constructions, a phenomenon whose data has largely gone unnoticed in previous work.
 Regarding clausal determiners, the analysis proposed in chapter 4 suggests that the  Gã data provide overt evidence for the claim in the literature that all CPs are dominated by a nominal projection. In this respect, the clausal determiner heads the nominal projection. Therefore, the analysis concludes that when a  CP occurs without a clausal determiner, it must have been deleted in the course of the derivation. Thus, a chunk of the chapter is devoted to showing how all the contexts in which the clausal determiner escapes the deletion mechanism converge, based on syntactic structure. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003654/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003654<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Universität Leipzig Dissertation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pronouns, null objects, overt pronouns, structural configuration, resumption, clausal determiners, deletion, kwa, gã, akan, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>220 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003654">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003654">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
