Schütze</a><br/>June 2018</center>&nbsp;<p></p>With the introduction of AGREE in Chomsky (2000), the relationship between the two elements in a agreement relationship went from being strictly local (Specifier-Head) to being unbounded (c-command with no intervening strong phase boundary) in order to accommodate long-distance agreement phenomena. Concern over the less restricted nature of the new approach led some researchers to propose alternative analyses of these phenomena that did not require the unbounded reach of AGREE, in the hope that a more restrictive theory might yet be salvaged. In this paper I scrutinize some of the most widely cited and fully developed of these alternative proposals, applied to extensively studied spheres of data, and conclude that they are deeply, perhaps fatally, flawed. While Chomsky’s version of AGREE is far from providing a complete and satisfactory theory of agreement, I suggest that it has yet to be shown that it can be eliminated as one component of such a theory.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003668/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003668<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under review for Contrast and Representation in Syntax: A Festschrift for Elizabeth Cowper (OUP)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agree, minimalism, long-distance agreement, spec-head, icelandic, existentials, predicate inversion, expletives, restructuring, copy theory of movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003668/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2017]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>183 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003668">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003668">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
