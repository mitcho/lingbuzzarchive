works) and takes as its empirical domain certain patterns of reflexivization in Spanish.
Concretely, it focuses on a hitherto unnoticed fact as is the impossibility of reflexivizing the
direct object in ditransitive constructions in presence of a dative clitic (e.g., *Juan se le entregó
a la policía vs. Juan se entregó a la policía, intended: “John surrendered to the police”).
Assuming that the dative clitic indicates that the goal argument is hierarchically superior to the
theme argument, we propose that this phenomenon can be explained as a matter of locality in
thematic assignment. This analysis has important theoretical implications regarding thematic
theory in general. Basically, we claim that this provides evidence for long-distance approaches
to thematic assignment under well determined conditions of locality and activity. In addition,
we discuss a putative counterexample for our relevant pattern (e.g. Juan se le entregó a María,
intended “John let María have him”) and show that its distribution parallel quasi-reflexive
structures in Spanish (e.g., Juan se levantó “John stood up/woke up”), which calls for a different
syntactic analysis of this type of examples. We then sketch a derivation that would account for
several morphosyntactic and interpretative properties of these cases in particular, and quasireflexive
sentences, in general.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002285/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002285<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>accepted for Verba 43</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>minimalist program, thematic assignment, ditransitive constructions, (quasi)reflexive constructions, locality, activity., syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002285/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1680 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002285">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002285">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
