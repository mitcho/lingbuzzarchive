The phenomenon described by the EPP in fact turns out to be quite challenging from a theoretical standpoint, as its properties look countercyclic under standard Minimalist models of grammatical architecture. The constraint describing the relevant ill-formed structures requires reference to phonological information, yet the mechanism that typically avoids violations of this constraint, i.e. movement to subject position, bears all the hallmarks of being a syntactic operation. Thus it looks like we have a syntactic operation triggered by phonological considerations, which is countercyclic. A novel approach to the EPP is thus required, which can handle its sensitivity to phonological factors, yet still fits in with our broader theory. This paper is intended as an initial contribution in this direction.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002698/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002698<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>epp, syntactic features, architecture of the grammar, counter-cyclicity, a movement, that-trace effect, for-to infinitives, syntax, phonology, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002698/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1454 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002698">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002698">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
