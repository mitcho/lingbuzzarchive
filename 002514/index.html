Due to the variability of contexts that allow restructuring (both within and across languages), most studies are restricted to specific languages and the conclusions reached in those works (e.g., about the size of restructuring infinitives or the mechanisms creating restructuring effects) are often contradictory. This paper compares restructuring in 24 (typologically diverse) languages and shows that despite the initial diversity, certain generalizations emerge that allow us to separate language-specific points of variation from the contribution of UG that restricts this variation in predictable ways. The cross-linguistic distribution of three restructuring properties (long object movement, clitic climbing, inter-clausal scrambling) shows that two types of restructuring need to be distinguished: voice restructuring, which determines whether a language does or does not allow long object movement, and size restructuring, which regulates the distribution of clitic climbing and scrambling. The paper concentrates on size restructuring, which is hypothesized to be available universally. Concretely, I propose that the cross-linguistic diversity of size restructuring is derived via i) a freezing approach to scrambling and clitic movement, ii) a clausal architecture defined over three major clausal domains (Grohmann 2003) rather than a cartographic array of projections; and lastly iii) variable (but in part predictable) positioning of the target projection of scrambling and clitic movement in those domains. The main conclusion reached in this paper is that rather than a single restructuring ‘parameter’ there are specific points of variation that conspire to create different degrees of restructuring.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002514/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002514<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the North Eastern Linguistics Society Annual Meeting 45, ed. by Thuy Bui and Deniz Ozyildiz.
