More precisely, pied-piping occurs when a movement operation that usually targets expressions of a particular type (e.g. wh-words) instead targets a phrase that contains an expression of that type. Pied-piping structures have long been a deep and difficult puzzle for formal syntactic theory. This is the first of two articles that present and compare two recent approaches to pied-piping, those of Heck (2008, 2009) and Cable (2010a,b). These works offer two very different perspectives on the nature of pied-piping, and thus yield rather different analyses of specific sub-phenomena. Nevertheless, there is much overlap in their general predictions and in several core assumptions. In this article, I present the basic phenomenon of pied-piping, as well as general summaries of Heck (2008, 2009) and Cable (2010a,b). I also explain why these works eschew the mechanism of ‘feature percolation’, an operation which has until recently been a staple of much work on pied-piping.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001372/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001372<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001372">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001372</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Invited submission under review by Language and Linguistic Compass</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pied-piping, ot syntax, q-particles, feature percolation, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>651 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001372">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001372">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
