One widely cited piece of evidence is the fact that a number of languages can pronounce copies of a wh-phrase in positions through which movement is assumed to take place. Although the existence of wh-copying in languages such as German has been celebrated as robust support for the successive-cyclic nature of movement, I argue in this paper that the German wh-copy construction cannot be straightforwardly analyzed as the realization of an intermediate copy of long distance wh-movement. This will be shown on the basis of systematic asymmetries between the copy construction and the extraction structures from which it supposedly derives.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002915/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002915<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>in Barnickel et. al (2016).
