I lay out the foundations of a theory of such representations, which I call subfeatures. A typology and case-study of subphonemic teamwork, a kind of multiple-trigger assimilation driven by partial coarticulatory effects, serves as the empirical basis of this proposal. I argue, on the basis of instrumental evidence, that such partial coarticulatory effects are relevant to the phonological grammar, and must accordingly be represented in it. In doing so, I take a stand in several debates that have shaped phonology. First, the debate surrounding phonological substance: I argue against a substance-free approach (cf. Blaho 2008 and references therein) by showing that some phonological phenomena (here, subphonemic teamwork) require a phonetically grounded, or “natural”, approach. Furthermore, within the field of phonetically based phonology, I argue in favor of maintaining a separation between phonology and phonetics, which are conceived of as distinct components of the grammar that communicate through the mediation of abstract phonetic knowledge. Finally, the theory I propose is representational: phonetic knowledge, which is what allows phonology access to some phonetic information, is reified into subfeatural representations that can be manipulated by the phonological grammar.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004252/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004252<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>UC Berkeley</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>subphonemic, coarticulation, gang effect, phonetic grounding, subfeature, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>301 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004252">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004252">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
