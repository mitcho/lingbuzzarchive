Much of it is devoted to a study of the distribution of the so-called pripredložnye ‘adprepositional’ pronouns in Russian. Their seemingly chaotic distribution proved to be hard to account for. Especially puzzling was the fact that beyond the P-object environments these pronouns, ‘n-forms’, appear only in the genitive standard DP of the Russian phrasal comparative, in which no preposition appears. 

I propose a uniform analysis of the distribution of n-forms in Russian, which maintains the intuition that they are ‘adprepositional’, i.e. occur in P-object positions. However, I refine the generalization by saying that n-forms are only licensed in the complement of P-heads. I thus make a crucial distinction between a vaguely defined group of prepositions and lexemes that are syntactically P-heads. Only those ‘prepositions’ that are P-heads license n-forms in their complement. 


I examine a large group of ‘prepositions’ in detail, arguing that only some of them are P-heads. The ‘comparative puzzle’ is solved by proposing that the phrasal comparative in Russian involves a null P-head that licenses the genitive n-form in the standard DP. Lexemes labelled prepositions in traditional grammars of Russian are proposed to split into three classes. Class I lexemes are P-heads, the only ‘true’ prepositions in a sense. Class II lexemes are structurally ambiguous between N-heads or P-N combinations (the complement being an argument of the nominal head), and a lexicalized P-head composed of syntactically inactive N- and P-elements. Class III lexemes are never P-heads: they are P-N combinations, transitive adverbs (A-heads) or gerunds (V-heads). 


The arguments for treating ‘prepositions’ of Class III as non-prepositions, and lexemes of Class II as ambiguous between prepositions and nouns or prepositional phrases are theoretically quite neutral and may be adopted to explain n-form distribution in various linguistic frameworks, making this thesis potentially relevant to a wide audience of readers. However, maintaining the same analysis to derive n-forms in the phrasal comparative while avoiding the claim that synthetic comparatives are actually prepositions (P-heads) is more demanding: it requires an abstract theoretical framework that allows syntactically active but phonetically null elements of various categories, here P-heads. The existence of independent evidence for the null P analysis of the phrasal comparative and the explanatory power of the resulting uniform treatment of n-forms justify this abstract construct, suggesting that this kind of approach may well be on the right track. 


This part of the dissertation has implications for the typology and morphosyntax of pronouns, and typology and theory of case. It may also be instructive for further studies aimed at classifying adpositions in various languages. In addition, the classification of ‘prepositions’ developed here may prove relevant for understanding the non-homogeneous behavior of different prepositions in specific constructions. 


The remaining part of this dissertation delves more deeply into the syntax of the Russian phrasal comparative, the structure behind the genitive standard of comparison. I show that the standard DP and the DP it is contrasted with belong in the same clause. This favors the simple, Direct Analysis of the standard DP, under which it does not involve additional (silent) structure. Next, I offer a new generalization, the Oblique Correlate Constraint, which imposes morphosyntactic restrictions on the genitive standard DP. I show that the constraint quite straightforwardly falls out from a more complex, Reduced Clause Analysis, positing abstract structure behind the standard. Looking at other languages, I suggest that the presence of such a constraint in their phrasal comparative may signal that they are to be analyzed as reduced clauses. This study adds to the growing body of literature on the structure of phrasal comparatives across languages and contributes to the notorious debate on whether standard of comparison in phrasal comparatives is to be analyzed as a simple DP or as a reduced clause.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004016/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004016<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ben-Gurion University of the Negev</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>russian, adpositions, prepositions, pronouns, case, comparatives, ellipsis, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004016/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>337 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004016">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004016">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
