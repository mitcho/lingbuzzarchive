Many linguists (not only morphologists) need such a term, because we often refer to minimal linguistic forms, but the various terms used by linguists in roughly this meaning are either unclear or do not refer to forms. The term “morpheme” has three rather different meanings, and other terms such as “vocabulary item” are too abstract. The term “morph” can be used as the basis for defining other widely used terms such as “root”, “prefix”, and “suffix”, which are currently often defined as kinds of “morphemes”. It can also serve as the basis for a clearer definition of suppletion (involving suppletive morph sets) and morph variants, thus avoiding the confusions surrounding the term “allomorph(y)”.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004926/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004926<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Morphology 30 (2020), 117-134</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>morpheme, morphology, syntax, terminology, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004926/v2.pdf">v2 [April 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004926/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>477 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004926">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004926">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
