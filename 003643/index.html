ellipsis phenomena: do the latter receive an adequate explanation only
if we posit covert syntactic structure at the ellipsis site? The great
bulk of the literature devoted to ellipsis has always assumed a
positive answer to this question, if only implicitly, and the authors
of much of the more recent work have taken pains to offer arguments
defending that view (e.g., Kennedy and Merchant 2000, Johnson 2001,
Kennedy 2003, Merchant 2015 and Thoms 2016). Kennedy (2003) in
particular offers a clear, concise summary of five of the seemingly
strongest such arguments, focusing on VP ellipsis:

(i) the distribution of ellipsis remnants reflects sensitivity to
island conditions on configurations which are not visible in surface
string at the ellipsis site;

(ii) the interpretations available in ellipsis data comply with Strong
Crossover restrictions that imply the existence of syntactic gaps
within the ellipsis site;

(iii) the anaphora possibilities available in the interpretations of
VP ellipsis data reflect Binding Condition B effects, implying the
existence of pronouns within the ellipsis site;

(iv) parasitic gap licensing behavior requires the presence of a
syntactic gap within the ellipsed material in order to license a
visible gap in an island context within the remnant material; and

(v) the 'attributive comparative' construction permits certain
possibilities which appear to violate the 'Left Branch Constraint'
just in case ellipsis is also involved, a pattern inexplicable on a
purely interpretive approach but one that can be accounted for as an
instance of repair, via deletion, of an offending covert structure.

We evaluate these five arguments, concluding that each of them is
either empirically deficient or predicated on an undermotivated
treatment of the relevant data. In the latter case, there are
alternative analyses which are at least as successful in accounting
for the facts, and require no reference at all to configurational
properties of the ellipsed material. Our conclusion is that the
various data sets offered in Kennedy (2003) in support of covert
structural analyses for ellipsis phenomena do not in fact motivate
such analyses.
