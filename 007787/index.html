I first focus on Condition B in Serbo-Croatian, showing that certain cases involving possessor binding that were analyzed as Condition B violations in the literature are not binding violations, but a consequence of specific information-structural requirements of different pronominal elements. This leads me to establish a number of novel discourse-related constraints on coreferential readings of pronouns. I show that strong pronouns are licensed by focus, in more than one way, namely if (a) the antecedent bears new information focus, (b) the pronoun is contrastively focused, or (c) another element in the same sentence as the pronoun is contrastively focused. By contrast, weak pronouns (clitics, pro) are licensed if their antecedent functions as a discourse topic. I also show that coreferential readings in the corresponding cases from English are sensitive to the same discourse conditions as in the Serbo-Croatian cases. Based on this, I conclude that English also has a strong/clitic pronoun distinction. Furthermore, I demonstrate that pronominal licensing in intersentential/cross-clausal contexts is subject to information-structural constraints identical to those in possessor-binding cases, confirming irrelevance of Condition B there. I also discuss the relevance of discourse conditions on different types of pronouns for issues relating to pronominal competition and suggest that the weak/strong pronoun competition in the relevant cases can be thought of in terms of properties of antecedents. I extend this approach to pronouns in cataphora (contexts where the antecedent follows the pronoun), showing that the apparent blocking effect of focus in cataphora derives from the requirement that the antecedent of the pronoun has the property of aboutness. Finally, I discuss how the tests I used in comparing strong and weak coreferential pronominal forms fare in the contexts where both coreferential pronouns and anaphors are in principle possible, i.e. what they tell us about the pronoun/anaphor choice in such contexts.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007787/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007787<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Connecticut</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>509 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007787">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007787">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
