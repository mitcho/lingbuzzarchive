Rosen’s Rule predicts, in part, that rendaku is more likely to occur when N1 has three moras than when it has two moras. Strong Lyman’s Law predicts that rendaku is less likely when N1 contains a voiced obstruent. Our wug-test shows neither of these predictions to be borne out. Although the null results must be interpreted with caution, by comparing the current results with those from previous experimental studies on rendaku, we conclude that the effects of these two factors are not substantial, and that they are not synchronically active in the minds of Japanese speakers, at least not for the Japanese community as a whole.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002137/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002137<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>NINJAL Research Papers 7: 111-120</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>japanese, rendaku, rosen's rule, strong layman's law, phonological experiments, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2339 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002137">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002137">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
