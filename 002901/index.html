Formally, proxy control involves a non-exhaustive obligatory control relation between one set of individuals i and another, f (i), that is discourse-contextually related to it. It thus bears a clear connection to proxy readings reported in the realm of anaphora (Jackendoff 1992, Lidz 2004 Reuland and Winter 2009) though the nature of the proxy relationship is fundamentally different in both. We show, furthermore, that the environments that license proxy control are a proper subset of those that license partial control, another non-exhaustive obligatory control dependency. A central question that arises with respect to non-exhaustive control dependencies like partial and proxy control, given that these are discourse-contextually conditioned, is whether their treatment should be relegated entirely to (LF-)semantics or to discourse-pragmatics. Here, we provide novel evidence showing that proxy control can feed phi-agreement on floating quantifiers and secondary predicates in Brazilian Portuguese and Italian to argue that part of the proxy control dependency must be (morpho-)syntactically instantiated. The theoretical implications of these findings are potentially far-reaching. In addition to widening the typology of possible obligatory control dependencies in natural language, proxy control also poses a strong challenge to movement theories of control (e.g. involving a null comitative PP containing the controller in the controlled constituent, as in Boeckx et al. 2010, a.o.). We propose a preliminary analysis of the proxy control facts in terms of Landau (2015b)’s “logophoric” control, suggesting in particular that the mediating perspectival C head in the control complement encodes a species of deontic modal (Mod_deontic): this captures the property that proxy control only obtains in the scope of deontic modality, just as desired.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002901/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002901<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To Appear in "Replicative Processes in Grammar", Linguistische Arbeits Berichte 93, University of Leipzig</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>proxy control, deontic modality, obligatory control, partial control, proxy anaphora, control shift, reference, phi-agreement, brazilian portuguese, german, italian, tamil, syntax, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002901/v3.pdf">v3 [March 2016]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002901/v2.pdf">v2 [March 2016]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002901/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>612 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002901">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002901">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
