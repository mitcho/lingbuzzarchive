All of them involve agreeing or non-agreeing forms of only in Romance and Germanic (I)  DP-internal agreeing only (II) non-agreeing only), (III) DP-external agreeing only as in French [[la reine] seul-e].  It is argued that in (I) and (II) DP is endowed with the operator feature as a consequence of morphosyntactic operations, whereas in (III) morphosyntactic operations leave the operator feature untouched. It is shown that in the latter case the operator can only take scope as consequence of the DP showing up in a high-enough position, normally the subject position. It is argued that insights from both the Criterion approach by Rizzi (1991; 1997) and the feature-checking approach of Chomsky (1995) can be successfully integrated into a more unified account of the facts at hand.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000706/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000706<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Motapanyane V.
