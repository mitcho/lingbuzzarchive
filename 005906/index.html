A critical observation about such gestures is that their semantic content is integrated into the meanings of spoken utterances: gestures can perform much of the same kinds of semantic work as speech, including scoping under spoken logical operators. One possible way of effecting this semantic integration is by treating gestures as part of the grammar: gestures are semantically integrated because they appear in syntactic representations (the Grammatical Hypothesis (GH)). However, I argue that GH requires some strange and undesirable stipulations about the nature and function of the grammar, in particular when considering the substantial variety of meaningful content beyond gestures that can be similarly integrated. I propose an alternative to GH, the Parsing Hypothesis (PH), according to which gestures are not a part of the grammar of a language like English; instead, it is the human parser that is responsible for integrating co- and pro-speech content. I then provide a toy formal grammar and parser illustrating what a PH-friendly theory of co- and pro-speech integration could look like.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005906/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005906<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted for peer review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>gesture; co-speech content; pro-speech content; integration; parsing, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>323 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005906">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005906">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
