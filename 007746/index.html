This restriction, which we call a definite island effect, has been variously linked to syntactic, semantic, and information structure factors, raising questions about redundancy and whether it is possible to reduce one factor to another. We consider two accounts – DP phasehood and the Specificity Condition – which make different predictions about definite islands in whmovement and wh-in situ languages, especially around whether the choice of main verb can neutralize the definite island effect. We test these predictions with parallel experiments for English (wh-movement) and Chinese (wh-in situ). Confirming existing reports in the literature, we observe that both languages show a definite island effect. Additionally, we also find that in English, but not Chinese, there is a neutralization effect related to the choice of main verb. However, the neutralization effect is only partial, contrary to previous claims made about English. We argue a combination of the PIC and the Specificity Condition is needed to account for the empirical findings in both languages, even though it might be conceptually more parsimonious to have only one constraint. Furthermore, the cross-linguistic variation in our results presents a challenge for an information structure approach to the definite island effect.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007746/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007746<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>experimental syntax, definiteness island, chinese, english, unselective binding, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>479 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007746">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007746">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
