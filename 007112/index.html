I show that various existing analyses of lowest-preference in agreement, such as case discrimination with ergative-aligned case, a low probe, syntactic inversion, and the Activity Condition, all fail to capture all the morphosyntactic properties of this particular agreement phenomenon. Instead, I propose that Passamaquoddy-Wolastoqey C agrees with all accessible third persons, only exponing the last set of features it has acquired. I implement this with a microparameter Expone Outermost, which states that only the outermost features on a multiply-valued head are to be exponed, building a parallel between multiple agreement and multiple case assignment. I then discuss the typological ramifications of this proposal, both within and outside of Algonquian, showing that it provides insights into some of the variation we find in agreement systems within and across different languages and language families.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007112/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007112<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agreement, locality, lowest preference, algonquian, passamaquoddy-wolastoqey, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>494 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007112">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007112">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
