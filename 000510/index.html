It is claimed that with respect to final conjuncts, this constraint simply manifests the clitic property of coordinators. As clitics, coordinators need their complement as their phonological host. Final conjuncts thus may not move. Based on the assumption that the categorial features of initial conjuncts are transferred to the coordinator and, it is claimed that this transference keeps initial conjuncts in situ, since elements without category-features may not move overtly. This new account for the immobility of initial conjuncts is supported by two facts. First, in the Chinese de constructions, kernel elements provide categorial features for de, which has no intrinsic categorial features and is the head of the whole complexes, and they may not move. Second, in the comitative coordinate constructions in Chinese, initial conjuncts do not provide categorial features for the coordinators, which have their intrinsic categorial features, and they may move. The paper specifies the semantic condition of initial conjunct movement: the coordination must be non-distributive. The new account of the immobility of conjuncts suggests that the constraint is not a construction-specific syntactic constraint. Instead, it is related to the lexical/morphological makeup of coordinators. Conjuncts as regular Spec and Complement elements may undergo syntactic movement. It has been generally assumed that movement is driven by morphological considerations. This study further shows that the blocking of movement can also be related to morphological properties of specific syntactic elements, in addition to the generally recognized locality restrictions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000510/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000510<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>coordinate structure constraint, csc, conjunct, coordination, movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>213 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000510">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000510">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
