Regional Northern Norwegian (ReNN) optionally employs verb movement in non-V2 contexts, allowing the finite verb to precede or follow the same types of adverbs. However, these two options cannot be freely combined, and verb movement affects the distribution of subjects in three ways: (i) subjects have to precede the verb (although they may occur in lower positions in clauses without verb movement), (ii) subjects have to precede all adverbs (regardless of how high the verb has moved), and (iii) subjects obligatorily receive a strong interpretation. This is accounted for through a combination of predicate licensing and Nominative Case assignment. I propose that the subject in ReNN optionally may pied-pipe the whole vP when moving for predication licensing, yielding the effects of verb movement. Furthermore, it is argued that Nominative Case licensing through <i>Agree</i> is blocked when the subject has remained inside vP. Thus, predication licensing through vP-pied-piping forces the subject to <i>move</i> in order to get Nominative Case licensed.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000487/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000487<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>subject positions, verb movement, embedded clauses, pied-piping, predicate licensing, nominative case licensing, norwegian, northern norwegian, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>262 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000487">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000487">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
