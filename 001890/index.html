It is for example notable that in simple transitive sentences, the two affixes occur between the tense marking morpheme and the verb stem and are normally in complementary distribution. In addition, both the RFM and OM occur in class 15 nominals, are doublable with a left dislocated DP, and are used with passives. On the basis of such similarities, I conclude that the affixes represent a similar syntactic category characterized as an incorporated pronominal element. On the other hand, I show that there are a number of differences between the two forms which include the fact that the RFM occurs in class 5 nominals, while the OM is disallowed in such contexts, the RFM is possible with another RFM on the same verb whereas only one OM is allowed on a verb at any given time. I argue that such differences support the thesis that the RFM and the OM attach to different positions in the syntactic derivation, with the RFM occurring lower than the OM.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001890/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001890<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001890">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001890</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in WOCAL  7 Proceedings</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>reflexive marking, object marking, incorporation, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>401 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001890">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001890">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
