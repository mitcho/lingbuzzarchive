(1) In every race, the colt won; 
(2) In every race, John won.

John Hawthorne and David Manley say that the difference between these two sentences raises a problem for Predicativism about names. According to the currently more standard version of Predicativism, a bare singular name in argument position, like ‘John’ in (2), is embedded in a definite description with an unpronounced definite article. The problem is supposed to be that (1) permits a covarying reading that allows for different races to have been won by different colts, while (2) does not permit a covarying reading——it can be true only if there is a single John that won every race. But, the objection runs, if the name ‘John’ is really embedded in a definite description with an unpronounced definite article, then the two sentences are structurally parallel and should not differ with respect to covariation. Appealing to Jason Stanley's (2005) "Nominal Restriction" I show that the difference between the two sentences above not only does not raise a problem for Predicativism, but is actually predicted by it given a certain plausible syntactic constraint on the over appareance (in English) of a prenominal definite article.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002486/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002486<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Analysis</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>predicativism names covariation nominal restriction, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1797 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002486">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002486">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
