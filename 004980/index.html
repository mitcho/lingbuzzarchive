On the other hand, there is a dramatically growing interest in sound symbolism by psychologists and cognitive scientists. Against this background, overarching goals of this paper are (i) to show that sound symbolic associations and phonological mappings share a non-trivial property (i.e. cumulativity) and (ii) to demonstrate that the same analytical device - Maximum Entropy Harmonic Grammar - can straightforwardly handle this property in these two apparently disparate domains. By pointing out a non-trivial parallel between sound symbolic connections and phonological mappings, I hope to show theoretical phonologists that studying sound symbolism can be interesting and informative. I also hope to show those researchers who study sound symbolism that an analytical device that theoretical linguists employ is useful in that it allows us to model an important aspect of sound symbolism. My ultimate goal is thus to enhance the communication between theoretical phonologists and researchers who work on sound symbolism who are not yet interested in theoretical phonology. The paper also has a descriptive value in that it summarizes various cases of cumulative effects in sound symbolic patterns from a variety of languages.
