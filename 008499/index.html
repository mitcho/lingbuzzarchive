Among these, certain forms, such as the Ethical Dative (ED), are less studied. The ED serves the specific function of identifying a person who is affected by the event described by a sentence. This is exemplified by the Italian sentence "Tommaso mi ha camminato fino al parco da solo" (literally, 'Thomas ED has walked to the park alone', meaning 'Tommaso walked to the park alone'). ED does not change the truth-value conditions associated with the sentence in which it occurs, thus being 'expletive' in a sense. In this paper, I will argue that the interpretative nature of these expletive elements depends on their syntactic configuration. More specifically, I will describe key aspects of ED and I will propose a syntactic analysis for it. Specifically, I will argue that this non-core / non-argumental dative is introduced as the head of an Applicative Phrase generated outside the thematic domain of the syntactic tree, in the CP domain. This hypothesis accounts for its expletive nature and various other properties. Additionally, I will reference the Speech Act Phrases theory to explain the preference of the ED for the first and second singular persons.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008499/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008499<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal_under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ethical dative; non-core datives; applicative phrases; speech act phrases; cp-domain, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>177 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008499">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008499">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
