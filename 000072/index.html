ABSTRACT<br>

This paper investigates the velarisation of dental consonants in the dialect of Cologne German (Stadtkölsch, henceforth CG), where diachronically primitive [t,d,n,nt,nd] appear as [k,g,N,Nk,N] in some words, compare for example NHG heute, schneiden, braun, bunt, binden with CG hück, schnigge, brung, bungk, binge. An exhaustive list of all velarised items is established, yielding a total of 101 words instantiating the above equation. The genesis of velarised consonants that is known from the literature is thereby confirmed: simplex dentals [t,d,n] become velar if preceded by a long high vowel in MHG. Dental NC-clusters [nt,nd] velarise to [Nk,N] after short high vowels. I show that both processes affect the entire CG lexicon. They are thus regular, and they are one. The literature usually treats velarisation of simplex dentals and dental clusters as two different phonological processes enjoying a distinct motivation. The CG testimony is incompatible with that view because of the quantity of the actors involved. Indeed, MHG long high vowels that trigger velarisation of simplex dentals appear shortened in CG, e.g. MHG zît > CG Zick [tsIk], to the effect that a complementary distribution of the quantity of triggers and targets obtains for all velarised items: if the triggering vowel is long, the velarizing dental is short ([t,d,n]), while it is double ([nt,nd]) if the triggering vowel is short. In other words, the volume of all velarisations ist constant, i.e. three skeletal positions: VVT > VKK, VNT > VNK (T=dental, K=velar). This implies, however, that simplex dentals not only velarise but also geminate. I show how this assumption provides an explanation for the facts observed. In a second step, it is argued that velarised dentals are still underlying geminates in present-day CG, although no trace of their gemination is perceivable phonetically. The argument comes from an independent palatalisation process which is arguably part of the synchronic grammar of CG: /g/ is subject to a complicated allophony whose most common result is [j] but which never produces [g]. Hence, there should be no [g] at all in CG. However, this expected situation is contrary to fact precisely because of velarised items: the only [g]s that are found in this language are former [d], e.g. MHG schnîden > CG schnigge [SnIg«]. I argue that velarised [d] does not undergo palatalisation of /g/ because its identity is not /g/, but /gg/. This position raises the theoretical issue of whether phonologists are entitled to posit underlying objects that never appear as such on the surface, i.e. 'virtual geminates' here. In this sense, CG velarisation contributes to the earlier generative debate on abstractness led by Paul Kiparsky, Natural (Generative) Phonology and the like. I submit that there is no way CG may be analysed without virtual geminates.

Phonologically speaking, CG velarisation is the exact reverse of what is known as Compensatory Lengthening: in the latter process, a short vowel expands to a position that was formerly occupied by a following consonant, while CG simplex dentals colonise a position that was held by a preceding vowel. I argue that it is odd to relabel a position just to accomodate the data: in Compensatory Lengthening, a Coda has to become nuclear, while the second part of a long vowel has to become a Coda in the CG case. This kind of relabeling may be avoided if a syllabic model is assumed that does not allow for Codas nor for branching constituents (Lowenstamm 1996).

Finally, the exhaustive list of velarised items, which was previously unreleased, allows for another insight into the mechanics of the process at stake: Umlaut triggers velarisation. This fact follwos from the presence of words that bear velarised dentals with preceding non-high [E]. These vowels all turn out to be due to Umlaut, primary and secondary alike. Why should Umlaut velarise? Two alternative approches are checked against general patterns of CG evolution since MHG.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000072/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000072<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>unpublished</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>velarisation (t, d, n --&gt; k, g, ng), german dialectology, rhenish, franconian, ambisyllabicity, virtual geminates, german diachronics, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>506 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000072">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000072">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
