That part of the non-surfacing structure has been suggested to be either deleted at PF (Ross 1969, Merchant 2001) or copied at LF (Chung et al 1995). Here, I argue instead that no additional structure is involved, apart from the structure that actually surfaces. By (mainly) focusing on three unnoticed properties of Greek sluicing, I propose that sluicing maps to (extra)sentential relations that make use of information provided by morphosyntax and the lexicon, and that the full-fledged interpretation (e.g., who left/it is) is computed (filled-in) at LF on the basis of the available morphosyntax. In effect, a prefigurement of a possible comparison of sluicing with concealed questions (i.e., DPs that give rise to full-fledged wh-question readings), E-type anaphora (i.e., bound variable pronouns that are cross-sententially construed), and Null Complement Anaphora (i.e., a propositional complement that is syntactically absent, yet retrievable at LF) seems justified.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001313/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001313<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001313">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001313</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Analysis 37, 1-2, 2011 (published version circulated under the permission of the publisher)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sluicing, anaphora, ellipsis, wh-question, concealed question, fragment, deletion, copying, e-type, nca, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>316 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001313">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001313">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
