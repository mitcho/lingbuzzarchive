To do so, I conducted an inference judgement experiment, asking the participants to assess how likely it is that a given speaker is prejudiced against a certain group based on how they respond to an antecedent utterance containing a slur targeting this group. As expected, responses in which the speaker repeats the slur give rise to the highest prejudice likelihood ratings, and responses in which the speaker indirectly challenges the antecedent use of the slur by replacing it with a neutral counterpart give rise to the lowest prejudice likelihood ratings. Crucially, elliptical responses in which the slur itself is not uttered, but that require lexical identity for the slur ('one' replacement targeting an antecedent noun slur) still yield higher prejudice likelihood ratings than elliptical responses that do not necessarily require lexical identity for the slur (bare particle and VP ellipsis responses to utterances containing a noun slur). These results, thus, call for a hybrid analysis of the prejudice component of slurs, whereby the act of uttering a slur gives rise to a performative prejudice-signaling effect, which necessarily gets lost under ellipsis, but slurs also have a non-performative truth-conditional (albeit not-at-issue) prejudice component, which gets preserved under ellipsis if the slur itself is recovered.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007109/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007109<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted for review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>slurs, ellipsis, inference judgement task, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>468 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007109">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007109">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
