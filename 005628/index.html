Person indexicals (e.g., ‘I’), for example, refer to the participants in the conversation, whereas spatial indexicals (e.g., ‘here’) specify spaces in relation to the location of the utterance. In this paper, we focus on deixis of person and space, and adopt a learning approach to investigate whether these two indexical categories have a common semantic basis. We present three artificial language experiments that test whether learners assume that new partitions of person and spatial indexicals share the same set of features. Our results suggest that learners tend to generalize a non-native person contrast from a pronominal system to a locative system, but do not extrapolate to the same extent in the opposite direction. Moreover, learners are sensitive to the naturalness of these systems, generalizing only when patterns of homophony between the forms in one system are feature-based, not random.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005628/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005628<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>indexicals, person, locatives, experimental linguistics, artificial language learning, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>703 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005628">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005628">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
