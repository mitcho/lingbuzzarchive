The sound of language in this view is ancillary, it is meant only for the externalization of thought. However, the thought-only use of language will not have survival value if the human mind created mostly fictions. It is in the real connections with the world—reference—that our plans and goals have a chance. What are the prospects for achieving reference in a thought-only view of language?
 
The topic will be discussed with a focus on what philosophers call ‘Singular Terms’ that enable a language-user to pick out, identify, or otherwise refer to an individual object. The presence of singular terms in human language not only gives a uniquely human shape to human singular thoughts, it ensures that such thoughts are shared between conspecifics. The sound of singular terms is essential for human language, it is not ‘ancillary.’<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006442/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006442<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Draft Only (Comments Welcome)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>singular terms, thought-only language, proto, reinhard resources, theory of descriptions, peter strawson, conspecificst, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>298 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006442">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006442">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
