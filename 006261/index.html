The same type of ellipsis has also been reported for Middle Low German (MLG) by Magnusson (1939), and the first attestation predates the ENHG one by about 200 years. Härd (2000) repeats Magnusson’s observation and adds that the ellipsis becomes “very frequent” from the 13th century onwards. Based on the newly available reference corpora of MLG, the current paper shows that
while Magnusson’s finding can be confirmed, Härd’s claim cannot be substantiated. All in all, the afinite construction is only scatteredly attested in MLG, but there is great variation between texts. The new data furthermore afford a new assessment of the origin of the afinite construction, and lend support to the hypothesis that ENHG and MLG underwent independent developments.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006261/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006261<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>middle low german, early new high german, afinite construction, auxiliary drop, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>361 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006261">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006261">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
