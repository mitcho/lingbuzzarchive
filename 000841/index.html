Following most influential studies (cf. Den Dikken et al. 2000, Den Dikken 2001, among others), the relevant constructions are analyzed as specificational copular sentences, in which the two major constituents  i.e., a (free) relative DP and the (to be) focused phrase  are merged in a SC structure. However, we depart from the general view (Higgins 1979, Williams 1980, Heggie 1988), as we take the clefted constituent to be merged as the predicate of the relevant construction. This is shown to be supported by semantic considerations and syntactic evidence, as well as by the discourse properties of the two copular constituents. Further support is provided by the observation that, beside their focusing function (which is generally acknowledged), (pseudo)clefts also imply a Topic strategy. This proposal is substantiated by intonational investigation: as a matter of fact, the analysis of naturalistic data shows a crucial correlation between tonal events and the information-structural articulation activated by clefts and pseudoclefts; in particular, it allows for the identification of different types of Topics and Foci in the relevant constructions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000841/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000841<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>manuscript</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>information structure, (pseudo)clefts, specificational copular sentences, syntax-phonology interface, syntax-semantics interface, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>4071 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000841">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000841">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
