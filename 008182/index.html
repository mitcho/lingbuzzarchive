syntactic distribution of the reduced (or invariable) forms of the verb in the
Gheg variety spoken in Shkodër. We can identify reduced forms with bare
bases3, more precisely stems ending in consonant or including the thematic
vowel. The probably best known instance of reduced form is the one that,
introduced by the preposition mɛ ‘with’, realizes the paskajore ‘infinitive’,
typically in control contexts where Romance and Germanic languages select
an infinitive form. The reduced forms, normally identified with past
participles, in reference to auxiliary contexts, show different morphophonological properties according to the verbal class, that we can divide, at least in the first instance, in vowel stems, including a thematic vocalic
element, and consonant stems, ending in the root consonant. The occurrence
of verb stems is not limited to participles and paskajore, but includes other
contexts with different readings. Moreover, bare stems distinguish two
alternants depending on the length of the stressed nucleus. We will propose
an analysis based on the hypothesis that the same basic operation of Merge
works both in forming sentences and complex words. Specifically, we assume
that functional morphemes on a par with lexical ones, are fully interpretable,
and, thus, they enter into the workspace for the syntactic operations.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008182/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008182<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Akte të Kuvendit Ndërkombëtar të Studimeve Albanologjike.
