This paper extends the cross-linguistic typology of multiple questions by arguing that Hebrew instantiates a new kind of wh-fronting language, unlike any that are presently discussed in the literature. It will show that Hebrew distinguishes between two kinds of wh-phrases: those that are headed by a wh-word (wh-headed phrases: what, who, [DP which X], where, how ...) and those that contain a wh-word but are headed by some other element (wh-containing phrases: [NP N of wh], [PP P wh]). The evidence for the existence of two kinds of wh-phrases will come from three sources: superiority, intervention effects and possible readings of the questions. We observe the special status of wh-headed phrases when one occurs structurally lower in a question than a wh-containing phrase. In that case, the wh-headed phrase can be targeted by Agree/Attract operations that ignore the presence of wh-containing phrases in the same structure. The paper develops an account of the sensitivity of interrogative probing operations to the head of the wh-phrase within Q-particle theory. It proposes that the Hebrew Q has an EPP feature which can trigger head-movement of wh to Q and that a wh-probe exists alongside the more familiar Q-probe, and shows how these two modest modifications to the theory can account for the intricate dataset that emerges from the paper, which is otherwise left unexplained.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001429/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001429<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>wh-movement, q-particles, multiple questions, superiority, intervention effects, probe-goal relations, hebrew, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001429/v2.pdf">v2 [December 2011]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001429/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2011]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1687 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001429">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001429">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
