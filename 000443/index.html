I set forth to investigate and explain two generalizations concerning the distribution of (root) suppletion in forms that (I argue) are related to the comparative, namely, the superlative degree of adjectives and deadjectival change-of-state verbs. The distribution of suppletion in these forms is shown to be parasitic on suppletion in the comparative adjective. I argue that this is best understood if the superlative adjective and the change of state verb are always derived from the comparative adjective, even where this relation is not morphologically transparent. The paper also briefly considers some theoretical implications of this conclusion for morphology (in particular the formal treatment of suppletion) and semantics (the decomposition of superlatives and change of state verbs). In the course of the investigation, what may be a novel poverty-of-the-stimulus type argument is introduced. Due to the severely limited nature of the relevant data in any given language, the generalizations are not significant language-internally but only when considered from a cross-linguistic perspective. That the patterns (but not the individual forms) are stable cross-linguistically and over time suggests that UG is constrained in such a way that the unattested patterns are impossible. The theory presented here has that effect.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000443/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000443<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>suppletion, comparative, superlative, change-of-state, poverty-of-stimulus, lexical decomposition, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1788 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000443">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000443">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
