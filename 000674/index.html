This paper seeks to challenge the notion that *any* language with obligatory wh-movement could be analyzed in such terms.  It will be shown that such an analysis is simply not tenable for one rather prominent case: Hungarian.  



Although there is a long tradition of viewing Hungarian wh-questions as sub-instances of the language's 'focus-movement' construction (Kiefer 1967, Horvath 1976, Szabolcsi 1980, É. Kiss 1981), recent research into the semantics of Hungarian focus-movement (É. Kiss 1998, Horvath 2000, 2005), combined with certain elementary facts regarding the interpretation of Hungarian wh-questions, effectively demonstrates that the operation of focus-movement in Hungarian does not target a feature obligatorily born by wh-words.  Consequently, the obligatory wh-movement seen in Hungarian wh-questions is not triggered by the same feature as triggers the operation of focus-movement.  



This conclusion potentially challenges the very notion that obligatory wh-fronting could *ever* be analyzed simply as obligatory 'focus-movement'.  Given that such an analysis fails to hold for the one language most often taken to exemplify it, we should very carefully re-examine other languages for which this analysis has been proposed.  It will also be seen that our argumentation concerning Hungarian potentially provides a set of diagnostics for determining whether (obligatory) wh-fronting in a given language truly is simply an instance of (obligatory) focus-fronting.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000674/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000674<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>focus-movement, wh-movement, hungarian, focus, partial answer, mention some question, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000674/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2008]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1350 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000674">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000674">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
