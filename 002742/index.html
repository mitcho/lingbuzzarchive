In this paper, I present data from Asante Twi, where the verb is doubled in the former case but there is do-support in the latter instead. I argue that the patterns can be accounted for by varying orders of the operations Chain Reduction (CR) and Head-to-head movement (HHM) at PF. CR may either bleed HHM giving rise to consistent do-support (as in German) or counterbleed it leading to consistent verb doubling (as in Hebrew). The Asante Twi pattern then is a result of neutralisation due to the inability of A'-head movement to form chains. The
account provides a unified analysis of verb doubling and do-support in predicate clefts, which derives all attested patterns to the exclusion of the unattested reverse Asante Twi pattern.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002742/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002742<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>verb doubling; rule ordering; asante twi; a'-head-movement; chain reduction, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>513 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002742">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002742">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
