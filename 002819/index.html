While relevant, much of this discussion fails to address the sorts of facts that generative linguists often take as evidence in favor of the Universal Grammar Hypothesis: subtle, intricate, knowledge about language that speakers implicitly know without being taught.   This paper revisits a few often-cited such cases and argues that, although the facts are sometimes even more complex and subtle than is generally appreciated, appeals to Universal Grammar fail to explain the phenomena.  Instead, such facts are strongly motivated by the functions of the constructions involved.  The following specific cases are discussed: a) the distribution and interpretation of anaphoric one, b) constraints on long-distance dependencies, c) subject-auxiliary inversion, and d) cross-linguistic linking generalizations between semantics and syntax.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002819/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002819<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002819">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002819</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Frontiers in Psychology</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>anaphoric one, islands, subject-auxiliary inversion, linking generalizations, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>130 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002819">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002819">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
