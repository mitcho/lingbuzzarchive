Yet, some languages have been reported to feature the opposite (unnatural) process of intervocalic devoicing. This paper investigates two such case studies. Pre-Berawan intervocalic *b and *g have developed into Berawan [k] (Blust, 2013; Burkhardt, 2014). Pre-Kiput intervocalic *g, *ɟ͡ʝ, and *v have developed into Kiput [k], [c͡ç], and [f], respectively (Blust, 2002). In Berawan (but not in Kiput), the development of intervocalic devoicing resulted in an unnatural gradient phonotactic restriction. To account for the data, we invoke Beguš's (2018, 2019) blurring process model of sound change. The model proposes that unnatural phonology derives from a sequence of at least three phonetically motivated sound changes. We show that the steps involved in intervocalic devoicing are (i) the intervocalic fricativization of voiced stops, (ii) devoicing of fricatives, and finally (iii) the occlusion of devoiced fricatives. Each of the steps is independently attested and articulatorily motivated. Moreover, our blurring process proposal explains aspects of the historical development unaccounted for by previous approaches (Blust, 2005). We also present new evidence suggesting that a single sound change could not have operated in the pre-history of Berawan. Thus, we maintain that all unnatural phonology arises from a sequence of phonetically grounded sound changes through the blurring process.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007386/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007386<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>beguš, dabkowski, intervocalic, devoicing, unnatural, unmotivated, berawan, kiput, tarma, quechua, voicing, stops, plosives, fricativization, affrication, occlusion, blurring, process, development, history, diachrony, historical, diachronic, sound, change, phonotactic, phonotactics, telescoping, phonetic, motivation, motivated, austronesian, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>284 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007386">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007386">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
