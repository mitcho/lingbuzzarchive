Thus despite the intrinsic limitations of gestures compared to full-fledged sign languages, they might access some of the same rules. While gesture research often focuses on co-speech gestures, which co-occur with spoken words, we focus instead on pro-speech gestures, which fully replace spoken words and thus often make a full-fledged semantic contribution, like signs. We argue that gestural loci can emulate several properties of sign language loci (= positions in signing space that realize discourse referents): there can be an arbitrary number of loci, with a distinction between speaker-, addressee- and third person-denoting loci. Gestural loci may be free or bound, and they may be used to realize 'donkey' anaphora, including with antecedents under negation. Some gestural verbs include loci in their realization, and for this reason they resemble some 'agreement verbs' found in sign language (Schlenker and Chemla, to appear). As in sign language, gestural loci can have rich iconic uses, with high loci used for tall individuals, and with the possibility of co-opting a location-denoting locus to refer to an individual found at that location ('Locative Shift'). Turning to plurality, we argue that repetition-based gestural nouns replicate some properties of repetition-based plurals in ASL (Schlenker and Lamberton 2017): unpunctuated repetitions provide vague information about quantities, punctuated repetitions are often semantically precise, and rich iconic information can be provided in both cases depending on the arrangement of the repetitions; we discuss some possible extensions to continuous repetitions found with some mass terms. We further suggest that gestural verbs can give rise to repetition-based pluractional readings, as their sign language counterparts (Kuhn 2015). Following Strickland et al. 2015, we further argue that a distinction between telic and atelic sign language verbs, involving the existence of sharp boundaries, can be replicated with gestural verbs. Turning to attitude and action reports, we briefly ask (following Lillo-Martin 2012) whether 'Role Shift', which serves to adopt another agent's perspective in sign language, has gestural counterparts. Finally, we suggest that some means of focus realization in sign language can be used with pro-speech gestures and can affect truth conditions.
