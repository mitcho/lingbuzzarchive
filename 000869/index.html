One context is identified where weak endings occur (regular DPs) and six where strong endings surface. Assuming that inflections are abstract feature bundles underlyingly, it is proposed that when Impoverishment applies in the regular DP, these feature bundles are spelled out as the weak endings. If they remain unaltered, the bundles are spelled out as the strong endings. On this analysis, a number of cases in the regular DP appear to be "exceptional". It is proposed that besides the main mechanism (Impoverishment), there are some secondary processes (a phonological rule, a preference and a requirement to disambiguate certain morphological categories). Finally, it is shown that weak endings in Predicate Inversion structures do not follow from the system developed here. Whatever the ultimate solution to this issue, it seems to be safe to draw two conclusions: adjectival inflections in German are the reflex of several mechanisms and inflections reveal important information about the inner structure of noun phrases.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000869/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000869<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000869">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000869</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Parts of this manuscript have been published in revised form in The Journal of Comparative Germanic Linguistics 18 (3)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dp structure, adjective, inflection, german, noun phrase, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>402 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000869">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000869">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
