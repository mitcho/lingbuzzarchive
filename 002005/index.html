The question presupposes that the answer was already made common-ground knowledge in the past (Sauerland 1999, Snippets).  We call this a "remind-me" presupposition.  While in German and English the repetitive particles can trigger a remind-me presupposition, Japanese has a specialized particle "kke" to bring about a remind-me presupposition.  We argue for an account of remind-me presuppositions based on syntactic decomposition of the question speech-act into an imperative part and a part meaning make-it-known.  On this account, the two particles take scope between the two parts of the decomposed question speech-act.  We show that the proposal predicts correctly that both particles must interact syntactically with the periphery of the clause in specific, slightly different ways.  This interaction corroborates our proposal that the decomposed question speech-act parts are syntactically projected parts of the question structure.  Our data therefore has general implications for speech act theory.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002005/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002005<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>unpublished ms.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>questions, particles, speech acts, movement, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1752 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002005">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002005">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
