The Right Roof Constraint is a well established condition that makes rightward movement very local, while FOFC, which has been proposed more recently, imposes a limit on how disharmonic languages can be. I propose that FOFC and the Right Roof Constraint are two faces of the same coin, because they both exclude the same abstract configuration which involves backward localization, either of a trace (in the case of the Right Roof Constraint) or of the selected head by a selecting head (in the case of FOFC). I assume that, since backward localization is costly for the syntactic parser, which proceeds left-to-right, backward localization is possible only if it is very local, namely phrase-internal. I propose that preference for a parser-friendly structure is grammaticalized as a locality condition stating that backward dependencies must be shorter than forward dependencies. My approach has consequence for the syntax/morphology interface. I show that some morphological properties commonly found in head-final languages can be seen as strategies to cope with the fact that head selection is backward in these languages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000921/current.pdf?_s=CYVSoCwx3F3X7Xzb">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000921<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000921">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000921</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>A slightly revised version of this paper will appear in a Mouton volume edited by Theresa Biberauer and Ian Roberts, which collects the papers presented at the GLOW 2008 workshop on Linearization</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>linearization, disharmonic languages, head parameter, final-over-final constraint, right roof constraint, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>436 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000921?_s=4LMYYuJXA6pKSyuO&amp;_k=iIV7t7whW_ezJcZJ&amp;2">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000921?_s=4LMYYuJXA6pKSyuO&amp;_k=iIV7t7whW_ezJcZJ&amp;3">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
