meaning or Grundbedeutung, even if the element in question has a wide range of meanings or functions.
The actual functions of these elements — as they occur in texts — are usually explained as
contextual or combinatory, derived from the interaction of the basic meaning with environmental cues
or triggers. While there are certainly lexical items for which this is appropriate, there are nonetheless
other ways of describing polyfunctionality, a generic term for situations in which multiple functions (or
meanings or senses) are associated with a single signifier. The goal of the present article is to
demonstrate that other kinds of analyses are possible, and can be equally interesting and useful for
describing the facts of Ancient Egyptian and for relating them to cross-linguistic research. Moreover
we show that Ancient Egyptian linguistic data allow us to test — corroborate, extend, or revise —
hypotheses that have been proposed in the typological literature. The paper is structured as follows:
Part 1 raises the problem of polyfunctionality and possible approaches to this pervasive linguistic
phenomenon; Part 2 presents the (classical) semantic map model developed by typologists in order to
account for the cross-linguistically recurrent relationships between two or more meanings of single
linguistic forms; Part 3 examines the applicability and usefulness of this model in Ancient Egyptian
with two small-scale case studies dealing with specific semantic areas ([a] instrument-companion and
[b] allative). In each case, the semantic map provides a principled method for the analysis of
polyfunctionality in both synchrony and diachrony.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004237/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004237<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Lexical Semantics in Ancient Egyptian</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantics, semantic maps, lexical typology, lexical semantics, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>230 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004237">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004237">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
