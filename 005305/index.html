Kratzer (1996), for example, suggests that EAs are introduced via  a functional head Voice, which composes with VP, containing the verb and its internal argument, through a rule of Event Identification. Bale (2007), on the other hand, argues that only eventive transitive verbs compose with their EAs via Event Identification while stative transitive verbs and all intransitive verbs take their EAs as direct arguments.
In this paper, we argue against Bale’s (2007) claim: using subjectless presuppositions with 'again', we show that typically intransitive verbs permit subjectless presuppositions when they appear with an optional internal argument. These facts are not predicted by approaches like Kratzer’s having EAs associate with intransitive verbs via Event Identification, nor are they predicted by those having the verb root directly introduce the EA, as in Bale’s. We use these facts to argue for the generalization that EAs can be excluded from the presupposition of 'again' only when an internal argument is present. We propose that verbal roots take thematic roles as arguments, along with an individual and event argument. These thematic roles are introduced by functional heads within the verbal projection, such as little v and Voice, and verbal roots take these thematic role denotations directly as arguments. This allows us to account for the apparent flexibility of intransitive verbs in allowing for subjectless presuppositions with optional arguments, and further develops a novel theory of root denotations and argument structure.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005305/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005305<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of WCCFL 38</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>subjectless presuppositions, again, argument structure, roots, lexical semantics, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>328 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005305">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005305">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
