I argue that the coordinators are focus-sensitive operators, and each coordinator has two positions. These findings dovetail with previous proposals in other empirical domains, suggesting that perhaps all focus-sensitive operators have two positions in a sentence, and are interpreted in the higher position (e.g., Cable 2007, Hole 2015, 2017, Hirsch 2017). The results reported here also suggest that the coordinator, traditionally considered to be the head of coordination (e.g., "or" and "but"), may not be the actual head, but just the daughter of a junct. 

At the same time, correlative coordination does not always look like it has the syntax that I argue for. When the coordinators seem to be higher than where I claim, I argue that ellipsis has occurred to obscure the actual size of coordination and the position of the coordinators. In the second part of this thesis, which studies the mapping from syntax and prosody, I focus on ellipsis, and argue with a prosodic experiment that elided material has prosodic representation, despite being silent. Because ellipsis has prosodic effects, we may be able to detect elided structure not just based on syntactic-semantic evidence, but also based on prosodic evidence. I demonstrate this with another prosodic experiment that argues for the presence of ellipsis in correlative coordination based on subtle phonetic effects in prosodic boundaries.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006846/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006846<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>MIT dissertation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, prosody, experimental phonetics, coordination, focus, ellipsis, stripping, either-or, corrective but, prosodic boundary, pre-boundary lengthening, semantics, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>485 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006846">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006846">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
