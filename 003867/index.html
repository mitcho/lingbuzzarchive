Japanese listeners also report perceiving the same high vowels between consonant clusters even in the absence of a vocalic segment. Although perceptual vowel epenthesis has been described primarily as a phonotactic repair strategy, where a phonetically minimal vowel is epenthesized by default, few studies have investigated how the predictability of a vowel in a given context affects the choice of epenthetic vowel. The present study uses a forced-choice labeling task to test how sensitive Japanese listeners are to coarticulatory cues of high vowels [i, u] and non-high vowel [a] in devoicing and non-devoicing contexts. Devoicing contexts were further divided into high-predictability contexts, where only one of the high vowels is phonotactically legal, and low-predictability contexts, where both high vowels are allowed, to specifically test for the effects of predictability. Results reveal a strong tendency towards [u] epenthesis as previous studies have found, but the results also reveal a sensitivity to coarticulatory cues that override the default [u] epenthesis, particularly when the vowel is in a context that is less predictable. Recoverability-conditioned gestural coordination has been proposed for production, and this study provides evidence that perception is conditioned by recoverability as well.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003867/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003867<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>(under review)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>perceptual epenthesis, recoverability, predictability, coarticulation, japanese, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>115 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003867">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003867">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
