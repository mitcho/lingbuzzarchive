Furthermore, they must be adjacent to the transitive verb that subcategorizes for them. These are properties usually attributed to Pseudo Noun Incorporation. However, there are two circumstances under which the requirement to be adjacent to the verb can be obviated: either a non-core argument is introduced between the subject and the PNI-ed object or the latter is A'-moved. While the introduction of an additional argument and A'-movement are disparate phenomena, a dependent case analysis of nominal licensing (Branan, to appear) can account for why they both allow a PNI-ed object to not be adjacent to the verb in Wolof. Branan argues, following Levin (2015), that all nominals must be licensed with case, with case assignment being calculated in terms of dependent case (Marantz,2000). In the impossibility of assigning case to a nominal, a last resort licensing strategy arises, namely, adjacency with the verb. Under the proposal that Branan makes about domains of case assignment and the position of case competitors in the sentential spine, bare nominal objects in Wolof cannot be licensed with case, hence why they must be adjacent to the verb. However, the introduction of a non-core argument provides a case competitor to a PNI-ed object, allowing it to do away with licensing via verb adjacency. Likewise, A'-moving a bare nominal object brings it close to the subject, which can transformationally act as a case competitor. I argue thus that a dependent case theory of PNI can provide a uniform analysis of the distribution of bare nominals in Wolof.In contrast, I show that a linearization-based analysis of PNI (Baker, 2014b) falls short of this goal.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005314/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005314<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>manuscript -- comments welcome!</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>wolof; pseudo noun incorporation; bare nominal; nominal licensing, dependent case, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>121 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005314">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005314">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
