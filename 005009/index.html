But in a paper published in Glossa, Wurmbrand (2018) argues that (i) QR is not clause-bounded, and the apparent clause-boundedness of QR is due to the human parser's difficulty in processing extraclausal QR; and (ii) the relative difficulty of extraclausal QR depends on the size of the embedded clause from which QR takes place. She then proposes a theory of scope processing in which parsing LF movement is a costly operation for the human parser, which in conjunction with independently motivated assumptions about A'-movement generates the desired results. In this paper, we accept Wurmbrand's descriptive observations and proposed syntax but argue against her theory of scope processing, as it does not capture the relationship between LF and PF as seen in other scope processing phenomena. We offer an alternative metric of scope processing difficulty in a formal framework, using Minimalist Grammars (Stabler 1997) and their associated parsers. The new metric accounts for Wurmbrand's observations as well as those cases that are problematic for her account, and points the way toward an explanatory theory of scope processing.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005009/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005009<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted for peer review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>quantification, scope, scope processing, formal parsing, minimalist grammars, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>141 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005009">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005009">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
