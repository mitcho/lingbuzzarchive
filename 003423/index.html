The necessity verb behaves like volitional and directive verbs, and triggers the force individuation criterion as defined in Copley et al. (2015), distinguishing between CAUSE and ENABLE causal frames. The individuation
between epistemic necessity and deontic necessity depends on the conceptualization of agency and the different configurations of force. I show, first, that the phenomenon is not just syntactical (pace Hofmann 1966; Perlmutter 1970b; Ross 1969; Jackendoff 1972; Butler 2003; Hacquard
2006, 2009; among many others): the variation in the interpretation (epistemic vs. deontic) is the result of differences in the argument structure (raising vs. control) of the modal auxiliary verbs. The key, I argue is causation, which triggers a shift from pure necessity, to intention as force (in
the sense of Copley et al. (2015), i.e., as a field generating force. In Greek, the epistemic and deontic reading of the necessity modal comes about in a conceptual causal frame, where the two clauses are connected with the subjunctive particle na ‘to/that’— a pattern that we find also in
other languages, including English, at least with some performative verbs such as agree, insist where the different modal reading are visible through complement choice. The current analysis implies a meaning of modality richer than mere argument structure (raising vs. control); and, by capitalizing on the causal frame and the presence of force in modal structures, the analysis
enables a principled explanation of the shift to intention-necessity without positing ambiguity for the necessity verb prepi.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003423/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003423<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>necessity, epistemic, deontic, intention, modality, force interaction, causation, agency, defeasible causality, nonveridicality, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>526 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003423">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003423">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
