Grammaticality stands for accordance with grammatical rules and principles of a given language. Arguably, these rules are discrete functions. Acceptability, on the other hand, is a compound result of everything that influences the linguistic behaviour of native speakers, especially when confronted with judgement tasks. Their results are – as in any complex judgemental task – variable and continuous. Grammatical rules are not vulnerable. They characterize any expression as either well-formed or ill-formed with respect to the rule that applies and therefore, grammaticality is a yes-or-no quality, and not a matter of more-or-less. If a given expression matches up, it is well-formed; if it does not, it is in violation of the rules and therefore ill-formed. It matches up if every applicable rule is obeyed.

If a rule of grammar appears to be fuzzy, its fuzziness is not a property of grammar but of the conditions under which the expressions in question are put to use or tested. For a syntactician, the assumption of weighted rules of grammar would be a capitulation in face of the complexities of grammar systems. Weighted rules have their place in language engineering, for instance in AI applications. Linguistic expressions are not "xy % grammatical", and the localization of an item in its appropriate syntactic structure is not governed by any uncertainty principle. It is conceptual fuzziness when people don't clearly distinguish between the concepts of (discrete) grammaticality and (continuous) acceptability.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004964/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004964<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In Ramshøj Christensen, Ken & Henrik Jørgensen & Johanna L.
