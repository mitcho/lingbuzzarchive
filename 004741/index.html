This is the penultimate draft.*** I show that speaker bias in polarity focus questions (PFQs) is context sensitive while speaker bias in high negation questions (HNQs) is context insensitive. This leads me to develop separate accounts of speaker bias in each of these kinds of polar questions. I argue that PFQ bias derives from the fact that they are frequently used in conversational contexts in which an answer to the question has already been asserted by an interlocutor, thus expressing doubt about the prior assertion. This derivation explains their context sensitivity, and the fact that similar bias arises from polar questions that lack polarity focus. I also provide novel evidence that HNQs lack propositional negation, and thus only have an outer negation reading (cf. e.g. Ladd, 1981; Romero & Han 2004; Krifka, 2017; AnderBois, 2019; Frana & Rawlins, 2019; Jeong 2020). Based on a treatment of HNQs as denoting unbalanced partitions (Romero & Han 2004), and competition with their positive polar question alternatives, I propose a novel derivation of speaker bias in HNQs as a conversational implicature. Roughly, if the speaker is ignorant, then a positive polar question will be more useful because it is more informative; so use of a HNQ conveys that the speaker is not ignorant. The denotation of the HNQ then makes clear which way the speaker is biased. The result separates high negation from verum focus, and I argue that it is more parsimonious and has better empirical coverage than prior accounts.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004741/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004741<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>polar questions; biased questions; negative questions; negation; high negation; low negation; polarity focus; verum focus; speech act operators, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004741/v3.pdf">v3 [May 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004741/v2.pdf">v2 [August 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004741/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1378 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004741">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004741">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
