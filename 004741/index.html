The distinct accounts are motivated by novel evidence demonstrating empirical asymmetries between the two kinds of questions. In particular, I show that bias in PFQs is context sensitive while bias in HNQs is context insensitive, and that PFQs require a focus antecedent while HNQs do not. I argue that PFQ bias derives from general pragmatic principles in combination with the conversational contexts that PFQs happen to frequently appear in. An understanding of bias in HNQs requires exploration of a further set of empirical facts, namely asymmetries between HNQs and polar questions with non-preposed negation---low negation questions (LNQs)---primary among them that LNQs do not share HNQs' requirement that the speaker is biased. This has been shown to hold crosslinguistically (Romero & Han 2004), raising the question of why negation in a high structural position in a polar question leads to a necessary inference of speaker bias. To pursue an answer to this question, I present novel evidence demonstrating that HNQs lack propositional negation. This evidence is taken to support an analysis in which negation scopes over an ASSERT operator, which produces a denotation unique to HNQs. To the question of why such a denotation results in the speaker bias inference, I give a novel answer: By combining the unique denotation of HNQs with assumptions about the utility of questions, I show that the only sort of context in which a HNQ is optimal is one in which the speaker is biased. If the speaker is not biased, there is some other question that more efficiently advances the conversation. The resulting account provides an explanation for the crosslinguistic link between structural height, negation, and speaker bias.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004741/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004741<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>polar questions; biased questions; negative questions; negation; high negation; low negation; polarity focus; verum focus; speech act operators, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>214 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004741">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004741">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
