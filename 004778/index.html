We  will  first  show  that  participle  agreement  only  occurs  in  contexts  where  the  participle  is  adjectival, viz., in stative passives and in resultative perfects, but not in eventive perfects. The 
 participles  thus  pattern  with  predicative  adjectives,  which  also  display  agreement  in  these  varieties. In the main part of the paper, we address double compound perfects and eventive passives, which also display agreement on the lexical participle. Even though it is initially not 
obvious that the  participle is adjectival in these cases, we will provide syntactic evidence for their adjectival  status. Furthermore, we will pursue the hypothesis that the adjectival head of all agreeing participles is a stativizer, even in the double compound perfect and the eventive passive. At the same time, both the double compound perfect and the eventive passive also clearly have an eventive component. We will model their behavior by treating the participles as mixed categories, viz., as adjectival heads that take a large amount of verbal structure as their complement (VoiceP/AspP). While recent work on German stative passives has argued that even those should be analyzed as containing a substantial amount of verbal structure, the behavior 
of participles in the double perfect and the eventive passive in the varieties under consideration is clearly different. They thus contribute to the typology of adjectival passives in German and beyond and show that the familiar distinction between ‘adjectival’ and ‘verbal’ participles needs 
to be further refined.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004778/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004778<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Glossa: a journal of general linguistics, 4(1), 105. http://doi.org/10.5334/gjgl.756</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>participle agreement, adjectival passive, stativity, double perfect, mixed category, alemannic, verb clusters, passive, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>406 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004778">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004778">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
