My goal in this article is to show that hybridity may not only be a surface phenomenon, but that certain forms of it may well be a phenomenon of the base of a given language. With respect to complementizers (which I call C or in glosses COMP), languages of this sort are being found in Northern and Central India, but surely elsewhere too. For instance, certain of Koopman's (1984) examples from Vata suggest that there is a final as well as an initial C: na appears initially in complement CPs in the context V_ as in (1a), while ka appears finally in

complement CPs in the context _V as in (1b).1Since the examples are drawn from various sources, no standardized transcription can be expected. For the representation of the Bengali examples, the following conventions are adopted: R, T for retroflex consonants, c, j for voiceless and voiced palatal stops, S for a palato-alveolar fricative, y for a high semi-vowel, O for a low vowel; after a consonant, h indicates aspiration; double consonants signal gemination.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000677/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000677<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Linguistics 35. 233-271.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>complementizers, complementation, syntactic antisymmetry, south asian languages, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>107 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000677">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000677">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
