We report the findings of a novel study of case transmission in Russian, based on data collected from 30 speakers. The findings contradict some key generalizations that have gone unchallenged in the field for decades; specifically, case transmission is much more prevalent than previously assumed, often co-occurring with the option of independent case. The pattern of case transmission is determined by the interaction of a complex set of factors  the grammatical function of the controller, the shape of the complementizer, the type of control relation (exhaustive or partial), and more. The proposed analysis builds on The Agreement Model of Obligatory Control (OC) (Landau 2000, 2004, 2006) and strongly supports the claim that OC exploits two routes  either a direct Agree relation with PRO, or one mediated by the infinitival C. It is derivationally local and free of the look-ahead properties inherent to earlier accounts. Finally, we provide, for the first time, a description of the full range of crosslinguistic variation in this domain, and situate it within a tight typological model.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000446/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000446<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>obligatory control, case transmission, russian syntax, pro, partial control, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>313 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000446">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000446">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
