That-trace effects in English have been treated as violations of prosodic wellformedness
conditions, i.e. Kandybowicz (2006a) and Sato & Dobashi (2016): the C head and
the trace cannot be parsed in the same prosodic phrase. Satisfying this condition is claimed to
allow for amelioration effects induced by sentential adverbs, narrow focus on the embedded
verb, and pronominal resumption. However, I argue that a [C t] prosodic parse cannot be
the reason for that-trace effects since such a prosodic phrase is not empirically supported by
several data points, and in fact should not be formed in the first place as it violates prosodic
well-formedness conditions. Adopting some insights from the Cyclic Linearization model (Fox
& Pesetsky 2005b;a; Davis 2020b), I offer an explanation for the effects and their amelioration
in terms of an interface condition: the Two-Copy filter. The filter bans two strictly identical
intermediate copies from occurring in the same spell-out domain as it would lead to a lethal
ambiguity problem during linearization. The effects are thus a subtype of the Obligatory Contour
Principle effects. Once the identity is avoided by pre-emptive rules (Radford 1977; Nevins
2012; Neeleman & Koot 2017) early during the derivation (i.e. adverb intervention), or repair
mechanisms at different PF stages, the effects fail to obtain.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005548/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005548<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>that-trace effects; syntax-pf interface; syntactic haplology; identity avoidance; relative clauses; narrow focus; resumption;</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005548/v3.pdf">v3 [November 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005548/v2.pdf">v2 [November 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005548/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1349 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005548">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005548">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
