The semantic effects of HM are often said to be absent, an observation that appears to distinguish HM from phrasal movement and raises non-trivial concerns on the theoretical status of HM in movement theories. The primary goal of this paper is to present a novel piece of evidence for HM with semantic effects from Cantonese. Based on an in-depth investigation into the distribution of quantificational heads such as aspectual verbs and modal verbs in Cantonese, I propose that they can undergo (overt) HM to a higher position and take wide scope in the landing site. These cases constitute instances of HM with semantic effects. Additionally, the application of the pro- posed HM interacts with an independently motivated condition on interpretation, namely, Scope Economy. The findings of this paper further confirms that at least some instance of HM must be syntactic by nature. It also eliminates an alleged difference between HM and phrasal movement, lending support to a unified theory of movement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006282/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006282<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>head movement, scope shifting, scope economy, quantificational heads, head- phrase distinction, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>355 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006282">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006282">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
