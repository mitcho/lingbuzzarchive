	In this response to your letter, I first point out that social grammars (“externalizations”) and mental grammars (“I-languages”) have not been, and cannot be, separated in practice by linguists. There are no specific methods for studying mental knowledge systems, and not only generative grammarians, but many other linguists strive for mental reality. There is no reason to think that some approaches in linguistics are less “hypothetico-deductive” than others.
	Like many other linguists, you are not very clear about the goal of GG in your open letter: Is it to describe particular I-languages, or is it to identify what is necessarily common to all I-languages? If the latter, then we would somehow have to subtract the culture-specific aspects of individual I-languages, but there is no clear method for doing so.
	In practice, GG must assume that the building blocks that it posits are innate, because formal notions like DP, CP, X-bar theory, c-command are thought to be identical across all languages, and there is no other causal mechanism for such identity. Innateness of such highly specific concepts is inherently unlikely, so the idea that languages can only be compared on the basis of uniform building blocks seems to be wrong. This does not mean that Chomsky’s 21st century ideas are wrong, because they no longer rely on a rich innate grammar blueprint. So you may be right that GG in this newer sense can do without innate building blocks, but then much of the practice of current generative grammarians cannot be on the right track.
