The central idea is that the morphosyntactic constituency of the output of the morphosyntactic derivation is spelled out (Match Theory-wise) as prosodic constituency in the input phonological representation of the phonological module of grammar. (This is a revision of Match Theory as proposed in Selkirk 2011.) The accompanying, more conventional, assumptions are that the phonological properties of the lexical items and morphosyntactic features of the morphosyntactic output representation are also given phonological expression (spelled out) in the input phonological representation. This grammatical organization has the property, first, that there is no possible direct effect of morphosyntactic properties (constituency or features) on the output phonological representation. The constraints that do directly determine the properties of the phonological output are only phonological in characterâ€”either phonological markedness constraints on the output phonological representation itself or phonological faithfulness constraints that govern the correspondence between the phonological properties of the input and output representations, as in standard optimality theory. Evidence is reviewed regarding the grammatical sources of mismatch between output prosodic constituent structure and the constituent structure in the output morphosyntactic representation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006546/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006546<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>tone, syntax-phonology interface, prosodic constituency, input phonological representation, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>276 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006546">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006546">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
