This paper argues for a derivational view of nonfinite clause formation, which in turn defuses what have been taken as strong arguments against an otherwise attractive link between nominative case assignment (with a licensing function) and agreement with finite T.   In particular, it is argued that nonfinite clauses are not distinguished from their finite counterparts as a matter of lexical choice. Instead, all clauses are built as full finite CPs, and are infinitivized in the course of the derivation, thus reviving proposals widely entertained in the 1960s — proposals that were abandoned in response to arguments that were watertight in the context of grammatical models of the time, but lose their cogency in the context of more recent models.

Where the current consensus views the special behavior of subjects in a nonfinite clause as a consequence of building an infinitival clause, this paper argues instead that the causal arrow points in the opposite direction. A clause becomes infinitival as a consequence of a higher probe targeting its subject in a particular configuration, in response to a rule of Exfoliation. It is this proposal in turn that suggests a re-evaluation of phenomena that some believe to have decisively militated against previously accepted hypotheses concerning nominal case. These hypotheses mostly concern the assignment of nominative case and the licensing of subjects more generally, and the observation that, viewed through the lens of early standard proposals, these processes seem to be sometimes observed in nonfinite clauses that lack a plausible assigner or licenser. The new view of finiteness advocated here acknowledges the absence of a plausible assigner or licenser in these nonfinite clauses on the surface. but offers evidence for its presence at earlier stages in the syntactic derivation, before infinitivization applies — an instance of derivational opacity ("nominative memories of a past life"), and therefore (if correct) an argument for a crucially derivational character to syntax.  

The proposal unifies this discussion with an account of the complementizer-trace effect — as far as I know,  a unique advantage of the Exfoliation approach.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006469/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006469<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Elena Anagnostopoulou and Christina Sevdali (eds.)
