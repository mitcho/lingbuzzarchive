In this paper we re-examine VocIns from the point of view of DM and argue that it is in need of revision.
The DM system of VocIns is set up such that lexical vocabulary items (LVIs) are inserted into root terminal nodes (RTNs) and functional vocabulary items (FVIs) are inserted into functional terminal nodes (FTNs). Generally speaking, though, if there are two types of terminal nodes and two types of vocabulary items and if VocIns is characterized as the pairing of a terminal node with a vocabulary item, there should in principle be four types of pairings. They are listed in (1).
(1)	a. FVIs in FTNs, b. LVIs in RTNs, c. FVIs in RTNs, d. LVIs in FTNs
The options in (1)a and (1)b are the ones that are allowed by the analysis just outlined, while (1)c-d are ruled out. However, whether or not these final two patterns occur is ultimately an empirical question, one which is rarely taken up in the DM-literature on VocIns, if at all. The present paper aims to fill this void. We examine cases where FVIs show up in RTNs as well as instances of LVIs occurring in FTNs. We argue that while the former pattern is real (and thus constitutes evidence against the standard DM-approach to VocIns), the latter is only apparent. We present a modified theory of VocIns from which this asymmetric picture follows.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001837/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001837<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>distributed morphology, syntax-lexicon interface, vocabulary insertion, roots, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>992 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001837">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001837">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
