If the A-/A’-distinction is to be truly derived, then the characteristic that distinguishes the two classes of structures must emerge from a conspiracy of independently motivated principles and the distinction should explain why the contrasts between A-/A’-constructions are precisely those contrasts and not other contrasts. The key theoretical proposal that underlies my account is that an independently motivated alteration in the terms available to Merge results in a crucial difference between the two construction types. Once a wh-phrase DP moves, a conspiracy of factors insures that it is altered on the way to its landing site or else it will interfere with normal Case and agreement relations (as first proposed by Rezac, 2003). An optional instance of Merge, late attachment of a prepositional head to the moved DP, ‘insulates’ that DP from Case and agreement, but alters the relations it can have with other DPs, with wide consequences for what an insulated DP can antecede and or license. A revision of Chomsky’s (1995) ‘Extension’, the Peak Novelty Condition proposed here, is independently necessary to permit a variety of constructions, such as late attachment, tucking in, and head-adjunction, among others. Thus the possibility to Merge an insulator to a moved DP is just a consequence of what Merge operations are available. Although insulation is optional, it is limited by independently motivated interface requirements that determine the distribution of insulated constituents, thereby explaining what is crucially different about A- vs. A’-constructions and why A- and A’-structures differ in just the ways they do and not in other ways.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002798/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002798<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Linguistic Inquiry</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>principles and parameters, generative syntax, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002798/v1.file">v1 [November 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1399 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002798">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002798">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
