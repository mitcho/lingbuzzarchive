It is difficult to pin down just what this difference amounts to. And it is difficult to account for this difference, since assertions of 'Must p' and assertions of p alone seem to have the same basic goal: namely, communicating that p is true. In this paper I give a new account of the conversational role of ‘must’. I begin by arguing that a ‘must’-claim is felicitous only if there is a shared argument for the proposition it embeds. I then argue that this generalization, which I call Support, can explain the more familiar generalization that ‘must’-claims are felicitous only if the speaker’s evidence for them is in some sense indirect. Finally, I propose a pragmatic derivation of Support as a manner implicature.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004220/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004220<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistics and Philosophy</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>epistemic modals, 'must', karttunen's problem, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004220/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>360 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004220">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004220">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
