Building on the results of recent corpus studies it is argued that having both a structural and a lexical analysis at disposal makes correct predictions for both adverbs. Second, for the area at hand (viz. when the two adverbs are considered in tandem rather than individually), it is argued that pursuing the two-track analysis on a broader basis than this has been done previously accounts for facts that have so far remained unexplained in the appearance of the adverb eft. Specifically, the paper explores the idea that two types of semantic analysis suggested for the so-called decompositional adverbs may be available not only transitioning one another but also systematically during one and the same historical time span. Third, further new observations are made as to why again may have won the competition at the expense of a well-established adverb in the history of English. The relevant observations hinge on clearer conditions for the winning competitor at the syntax-semantics interface.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004719/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004719<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistica Brunensia 65: 51-65.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>linguistic cycles, semantic change, decompositional adverbs, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>111 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004719">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004719">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
