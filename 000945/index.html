Typically, philosophers of language, pragmatists and others working on pragmatic free enrichment consider only a reduced set of facts from English (if at all) to substantiate their claims. But looking at a reduced set of facts from Englishor from any other language in isolationcan only afford limited (and, sometimes, wrong) results, because we can only see whatever this one language chooses to express (the problem with English can be worse: it is very impoverished morphologically). I look in detail at two phenomena that pragmatic free enrichment is currently taken to account for: adjectival fragments and the implicit object of certain verbs. In each case, finding out what native speakers of natural languages actually do turns out to be very informative: we find evidence that the implicit material is generated by the grammar, not provided for pragmatically. This methodology, crucial to linguistics and science in general, allows us to isolate those (aspects of) phenomena that must be dealt with grammatically, a task that is very difficultif not impossibleto carry out from a purely theoretical standpoint.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000945/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000945<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>grammar, pragmatics, free enrichment, division of labor, cross-linguistic comparison, adjectival fragments, ellipsis, implicit indefinite objects, incorporation, personal datives, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>396 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000945">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000945">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
