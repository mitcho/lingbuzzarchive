Phrase(FP), is encoded in simplex EkeGusii declarative
sentences. Quantifiers and arguments realized in the
subject position seem to be sructurally ambiguos between a
an in situ and ex situ focus marking, however in this paper
the ex situ pattern in which all the focssed constructions in
the Determiner Phrase are moved to the CP, which is a
criterial position, is preffered. The main verb and the
predicate complements (objects, oblique, adverbials etc.) in
EkeGusii are displaced from the complement of the v’P
position to a FocP in the CP, or to a hijacked/stranded
position, a FocP within the IP Phase, imediately before the
verb (IBV) position. The focus displacement patterns to the
two stipulated positions are monosemous, that is, they
receive the same interpretation and obey the principles of
focus projection and the minimal link condition by
responding to the operation attract, with the exception of
the in situ case of the indirect object, whose movement
blocked by the realization of a focus marked element in IBV
position. The in situ and the stranded focus pattern exhibit
interpretational mismatches.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007806/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007806<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Jadavpur Journal of Language and Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>focus, innformation structure, minimalist program, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>115 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007806">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007806">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
