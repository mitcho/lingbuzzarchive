syntax are the Strict Cycle Condition (SCC) and the Minimal Link
Condition (MLC). Despite the fact that these two principles have
proved useful in many cases, it has been noted in the literature that
some syntactic analyses, well motivated otherwise, are in conflict
with either the MLC or the SCC. In this manuscript, I make a new
proposal as to how one may reconcile SCC and MLC with these analyses
while at the same time maintaining SCC and MLC in a maximally strong
form. To this end, I propose that the (often implicit) assumption that
the objects generated by syntactic derivations form sequences of
monotonically growing trees should be abandoned. Rather, I suggest
that syntactic trees may shrink temporarily. I call such derivations
"non-monotonic," and I illustrate that they have a series of welcome
side effects. Non-monotonic derivations derive equidistance effects,
account for Holmberg's Generalization and for certain inversion
phenomena; they provide a natural explanation for certain
anti-Principle C effects thereby making concepts such as chain
formation or lethal ambiguity superfluous. And they may offer a handle
for explaining the absence of superiority effects and certain islands.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003005/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003005<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>minimality, strict cyclicity, workspace, object shift, holmberg's generalization, head-movement, principle c, superiority, topic island, complex noun phrase, scandinavian</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>471 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003005">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003005">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
