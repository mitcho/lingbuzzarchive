Prior authors have viewed these additional implications as semantic in nature, encoded directly in the lexical semantics of the morpheme (Leer 1991; Copley 2005; Plungian & van der Auwera 2006). Under this view, the morphemes in question express a special category of tense, one that has been labeled ‘discontinuous past’ (Plungian & van der Auwera 2006). Through in-depth investigation of one such ‘discontinuous past’ marker in the Tlingit language, I argue that – to the contrary – the special implications of these morphemes are not semantic, and are instead defeasible pragmatic inferences. Consequently, putative instances of ‘discontinuous past’ are in their semantics simply past tenses. I provide a formalized analysis of the pragmatic inferences associated with these past tenses, whereby they ultimately follow from (i) the optionality of the tense markers in question, and (ii) a special principle relating to the inherent topicality of the utterance time. The empirical and analytic results align well with a restrictive theory of cross-linguistic variation in tense semantics, one where the ‘traditional’ categories of PAST, PRESENT, and FUTURE are the only ones representable in human language (Cable 2013).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002517/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002517<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>tense, semantics, typology, tlingit, cessation implicature, discontinuous past, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1127 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002517">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002517">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
