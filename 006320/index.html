Differential Object Marking and (ii) (for some speakers) Exceptional Case Marking, Catalan like
Italian and French, displays a transitivity-sensitive pattern in causatives under FACERE whereby
the causee can be realised as dative only where its complement is ‘transitive’. We propose an
analysis of this pattern based on Cyclic Agree (building on Bobaljik & Branigan 2006, Béjar &
Rezac 2009). On our approach, transitivity-sensitive dative arises where a probe agrees with a DP
which requires case licensing, having previously probed (potentially defectively) a closer XP of
any kind. Downward Cyclic Agree is possible, in this context, because neither goal c-commands
the other, making them both visible to a single higher probe. This model captures the basic
transitivity-sensitive pattern and the strict Person Case Constraint (PCC) effects observed in this
domain as well as the fact that dative is triggered not only by DPs requiring structural/dependent
case but also by ‘defective interveners’ (PPs, CPs, case-marked DPs/clitics). We show that this
Agree-based account has potential advantages over competing dependent-case approaches
because of its ability to handle: (i) c-command patterns between the causee and other arguments,
(ii) the behaviour of PP complements and (iii) the strict PCC effects observed under FACERE in
Catalan (and across Romance).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006320/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006320<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Syntax</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>case, agreement, dependent case, pcc, case competitor, causative, dative, transitivity, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>270 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006320">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006320">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
