Relatedly, theorists can specify the contents of universally quantified sentences in first-order or second-order terms. We offer new evidence that this logical first-order vs. second-order distinction corresponds to a psychologically robust individual vs. group distinction that has behavioral repercussions. Participants were shown displays of dots and asked to evaluate sentences with each, every, or all combined with a predicate (e.g., big dot). We find that participants are better at estimating how many things the predicate applied to after evaluating sentences in which universal quantification is indicated with "every" or "all", as opposed to "each". We argue that "every" and "all" are understood in second-order terms that encourage group representation, while "each" is understood in first-order terms that encourage individual representation. Since the sentences that participants evaluate are truth-conditionally equivalent, our results also bear on questions concerning how meanings are related to truth-conditions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004486/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004486<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistics and Philosophy (accepted)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>natural language quantifiers, meaning, logic, experimental semantics, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004486/v2.pdf">v2 [October 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004486/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1120 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004486">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004486">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
