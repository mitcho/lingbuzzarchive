I don’t know who'. In Mandarin, sluice-like strings (‘S-strings’) with argument wh-remnants require the presence of shi, a form that is ambiguous between a copula and a focus marker. This paper proposes a hybrid analysis of Mandarin S-strings as having two possible derivations, a sluice and a pseudo-sluice, unless one of the structures is independently forced. When shi is a copula, the S-string has a pseudo-sluice analysis, [pro be wh-phrase], involving neither movement nor ellipsis. When shi is a focus marker, the S-string is derived by focus movement followed by TP-ellipsis yielding a sluice analysis. Results from a comprehension experiment with 59 Mandarin-speaking children show that 3-4-year-olds have only a pseudo-sluice/copula analysis of S-strings. They acquire the sluice/focus movement derivation at approximately age 5 at which point they show the “subject advantage” typically associated with A’-movement structures in young children. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007575/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007575<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>MA Thesis at UCLA</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sluicing, pseudo-sluicing, mandarin, acquisition, intervention effects, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>219 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007575">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007575">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
