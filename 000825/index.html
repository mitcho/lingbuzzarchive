We distinguish between syntax-internal features and features which have effects at the interfaces. We highlight a distinction between (positionally motivated) categorial features and (cross-classificatory) non-categorial features. We also propose a distinction between first-order features and second-order features (properties of features), and between second-order features which are fixed for a given language (parameters) and second-order features which vary from one token of a feature to another (variable second order features). With these distinctions in place, we argue that, given Inclusiveness, dependencies in syntax must be encoded by variable second order features, such as strength, uninterpretability, or the property of lacking a value, so strict privativity is too strong a constraint on such feature systems. We also explore the various feature theories that emerge from the conceptual distinctions we draw, highlighting the need for a restrictive but optimal theory of second as well as first order features.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000825/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000825<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted to the Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Minimalism</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>features, minimalism, privative, checking, uninterpretable, uninterpretability, feature value, feature valuation, unvalued, attribute-value matrix, hpsg, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000825/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2009]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>6521 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000825">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000825">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
