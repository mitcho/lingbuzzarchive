employs the Universal Dependency corpus to explore the relationship between word order 
feature and surface word order, and reexamining of word order classification models not 
only of Mandarin Chinese but also across diverse global languages. It evaluates the binary 
word orders of 78 languages and reveals the cross-linguistic harmony between word order 
features and surface word order features. Out of more than thirty dependency relations, 
six pairs display a highly significant bidirectional association with word order types. 
Moreover, by considering word order and straightforward textual frequency measurements, 
a substantial linear correlation emerges between word order features and surface word 
order across global languages, highlighting cross-linguistic harmony. Building upon this 
foundation, the paper introduces a two-dimensional model for word order classification. It 
contends that Mandarin typifies a surface VO structure, representing weakly harmonious 
language with feature mixing (include both “neutral feature” and “feature mixture”). This 
characteristic is likely linked to Mandarin's approach to encoding prototypical transitive 
events and its linguistic contact environment.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007628/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007628<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>word order typology; mandarin chinese; harmony; annotated corpus, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>297 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007628">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007628">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
