This paper reconsiders the full range of facts from standard contemporary English, along with a detailed examination of diachronic, dialectal and comparative evidence. The picture that emerges is that a Case-based account is untenable. The clearest parallels to the distribution of 'for' are actually found with that of overt 'that', which is not traditionally thought to be related to Case. The fact that 'for' only appears before overt subjects can then be related to the COMP-trace effect -- which holds for both 'for' and 'that' and essentially rules out an overt complementizer before a silent subject position. The question then is what regulates the overt distribution of complementizers to yield these effects. The later parts of the paper argue that the outlines of the restrictions, in particular the clear relevance of overtness of both the complementizer and what follows it, point toward the relevance of prosodic restrictions. A suggestive proposal along these lines is made, building on An (2007)'s Intonational Phrase Edge Generalization, which places requirements on overt material in the mapping from syntactic structures to prosodic domains.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004432/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004432<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>K.
