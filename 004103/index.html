All these models are concerned with the question of whether morphologically complex words are decomposed during online processing or whether they are stored as chunks in the mental lexicon. We contribute new data from
Polish showing that reaction times to target words semantically related to the heads of transparent compounds were significantly faster than to target words semantically related to the heads of opaque compounds in Polish. This may be interpreted as evidence in favour of the view that semantically transparent compound words are decomposed and we access the lemmas of their constituent elements whereas semantically opaque compounds are not decomposed and there is no access to their constituent lemmas.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004103/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004103<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>http://www.ejournals.eu/SPL/2017/Issue-3/art/10124/</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>morphology, language processing, polish compound words, complex words, semantic transparency, lexical decision, masked priming, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>446 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004103">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004103">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
