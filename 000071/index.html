<br>ABSTRACT

<br>In a non-neglectable number of languages without genetic kinship, consonants that either follow a (heterosyllabic) consonant or occur word-initially display an identical behaviour. That is, absence of alteration diachronically and synchronically as well, or even strengthening is observed in these two positions, whereas the same consonants undergo various lenition-processes when they come to stand in a Coda or in intervocalic position. The 'Strong position' {C, #}__ is thereby defined. It is the exact mirror-image of the Coda-context __{C, #}. For this reason, we refer to it under the label 'Coda-Mirror'. The CVCV-model holds that syllabic structure boils down to a strict consecution of non-branching Onsets and non-branching Nuclei. Unlike classical models that operate with Rhymes and Codas, this theory of syllabic representation is able to describe the Coda-Mirror as a phonological object that is uniform (i. e. non-disjunctive) and unique (i. e. different from any other. It is shown that this result allows for deriving the respective strength (Coda-Mirror) and weakness (Coda and intervocalic position) from the action of two devices that are established in Government Phonology, viz. Government and Licensing. The phenomena reviewed in this article lead to a more precise definition of theses forces and their interaction.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000071/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000071<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>cf. abstract</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>lenition, fortition, government phonology, government, licensing, high german consonant mutation, verner's law, romance diachronics, somali, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>443 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000071">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000071">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
