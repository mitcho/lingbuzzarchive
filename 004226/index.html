speaker-oriented and subject-oriented inferences is crucial for understanding
the motivations and mechanisms of semantic change in grammaticalization
and subjectification, on the one hand, and for clarifying the links between
semantic change and reductive formal changes, on the other. Speaker-oriented
inferences have significant consequences, leading to the relaxation of
selectional restrictions on a construction. In turn, the relaxation of selectional
restrictions can create conditions in which the type and token frequency of a
construction can rise considerably. Furthermore, changes in the selectional
restrictions on a construction can themselves catalyze semantic change by
coercing listeners into new form–function pairings. This framework is applied
to allative futures, a typological comparative concept developed in order to
compare structurally diverse future tenses. Following the typological
discussion, a diachronic case study of the emergence and grammaticalization
of a verbless allative future in Ancient Egyptian is presented. Such verbless
allative futures provide evidence against assumptions that purpose constructions
as such are not grammaticalized as future tense constructions (Schmidtke-
Bode 2009). Rather, they corroborate earlier hypotheses that it is the allative
component of source constructions that crucially leads to intention meanings,
and from intention to prediction (see, e.g., Bybee, Pagliuca, and Perkins 1994).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004226/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004226<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Acta Linguistics Hafniensia</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>grammaticalization; future tenses; pragmatic and semantic change; subjectification, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>148 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004226">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004226">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
