to make sense of all their contexts of use.  The analysis involves an exploitation and extension of Rooth's (1994) `alternative semantics'.  I argue that k-words in Bengali uniformly trigger the construction of a set of `alternatives' in this Roothian sense.  Without  a focus-particle 

suffix, these alternatives are the standard alternative propositions such as are found in Rooth's treatment of contrastive focus.  With the suffix attached, I argue for the construction of an `alternative DP', where the suffix attachment marks the scope of `alternative construction'.  What both these uses have in common is the existence of a `focus semantic value' in Rooth's terms  (or perhaps more generally here, an `alternative semantic value'), in the absence of an actual `ordinary semantic value'.  This fact makes these forms unsuitable for use in standard declarative contexts except under certain linguistic and discourse conditions. We see that downward entailing contexts specifically do provide a linguistic environment which can pragmatically convert this `alternative  semantic value' into definite propositional context.   In addition, non-propositional speech acts such as questioning and imperative `choice' contexts were also found to be felicitous with `alternative semantic values'.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000183/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000183<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>none (short version in NELS 97)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>alternative semantics, free choice, negative polarity, bengali, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1775 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000183">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000183">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
