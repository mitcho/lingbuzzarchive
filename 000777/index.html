Thus, AT is not as restrictive as it seems at first. I demonstrate that the following configurations are not always ruled out by the Linear Correspondence Axiom (LCA): (i) ternary branching; (ii) heads adjoined to non-heads; (iii) non-heads adjoined to heads; (iv) multiple specifiers; and (v) multiple adjunction to heads. They may be allowed depending on the structural context in which they appear. In and of itself, this is neither good nor bad. It is an empirical matter whether additional types of structure apparently overgenerated by AT correspond to representations of natural language sentences. However, since those were initially thought to be blocked by the mechanisms of AT, and initially thought not to exist, it is worth showing that, unless AT is modified accordingly, such structures are indeed predicted to be well-formed, modulo the LCA.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000777/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000777<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Snippets, #18 [http://www.ledonline.it/snippets/allegati/snippets18000.pdf]</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>antisymmetry theory, lca, phrase structure, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000777/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2008]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>317 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000777">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000777">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
