This is partly because of the time period in which the Beowulf manuscript was created, Although the vast majority of today’s population in the United States is literate, very few can read Old English (OE), the language of Beowulf. Contemporary readers are forced to rely exclusively upon a translated edition of the work. By doing so, it is unknown whether the translations remain faithful to the original manuscript of Beowulf. This is a cause for concern amongst not only scholars, but every day readers. How can they be certain that they are reading a translation that is faithful to the original manuscript without having to learn the language of the poem? This paper seeks to ascertain how reliable translations of renowned Beowulf scholars of the 19th and 20th century are in comparison to the original manuscript. In this study, the author also examines the agenda of each other as a means to explain the discrepancies. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003845/current.doc">doc</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003845<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>CSU Bakersfield</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>beowulf linguistics syntax phonology, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>178 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003845">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003845">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
