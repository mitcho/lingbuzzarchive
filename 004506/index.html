The main focus is on “supersloppy” readings of person indexicals in VP-ellipsis, in which 'you' can be bound by 'I' and vice versa. The empirical properties of these cases, tested in a large-scale systematically controlled questionnaire, show that 'I' and 'you' can be construed as e-type pronouns dependent on each other. This challenges the Kaplanian fixity theory of indexicals in a new way: not only can first- and second-person pronouns be bound, they can also contribute descriptive meanings that affect the interpretation of (elided) sentences. Readings similar to supersloppy readings furthermore extend to time and location indexicals, demonstratives and proper names, which indicates the linguistic relevance of other relations between indexicals and between non-indexicals. All these types of dependent readings shed new light on the theories of indexicals, demonstratives and proper names as well as e-type pronouns.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004506/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004506<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Journal of Semantics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>indexical, sloppy reading, e-type pronoun, vp-ellipsis, focus, proper name, demonstrative, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004506/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>783 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004506">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004506">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
