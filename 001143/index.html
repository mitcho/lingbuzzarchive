computational property of natural language that has been so elusive that it has

made all attempts to characterize its real computational property ultimately fail.

Earlier natural language was thought to be context-free. However, it was

gradually realized that this does not hold much water given that a range of

natural language phenomena have been found as being of non-context-free

character that they have almost scuttled plans to brand natural language contextfree.

So it has been suggested that natural language is mildly context-sensitive

and to some extent context-free. In all, it seems that the issue over the exact

computational property has not yet been solved. Against this background it will

be proposed that this exact computational property of natural language is

perhaps the N-th dimension of language, if what we mean by dimension is

nothing but universal (computational) property of natural language.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001143/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001143<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001143">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001143</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Research in Computing Science, Vol. 46, P. 55-66.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>hidden fundamental variable; natural language; context-free; computational property, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>69 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001143">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001143">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
