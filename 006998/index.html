In contrast to most of the existing work that has attempted to provide a unified account of the ban on agreement with reflexive anaphors known as the Anaphor Agreement Effect, the present contribution defends the view whereby the AAE is a by-product of agreement-related patterns independently attested in the languages surveyed. I argue that the AAE is heterogeneous and arises from independent factors specific to a particular language or language family (the internal composition of reflexive anaphors as possessed body parts, or the defective case paradigms for reflexive anaphors). There is no deep-rooted ban on agreement with reflexive anaphors, and there can therefore be no strategies that languages would ‘use’ to avoid violating it.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006998/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006998<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agreement, reflexive binding, anaphor agreement effect, syntax, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>437 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006998">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006998">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
