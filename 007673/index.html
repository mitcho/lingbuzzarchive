InqD combines Inquisitive Semantics (Ciardelli et al. 2018), which is a framework for studying questions, and Plural Compositional DRT (PCDRT, for short, Brasoveanu 2008, 2010), which is a dynamic framework for studying plural anaphora. Like Inquisitive Semantics, a context in InqD is modeled as a non-empty, downward closed set of information states; like PCDRT, an information state is modeled as a set of assignment worlds, i.e, pairs consisting of a possible world and a set of assignments. Combining dynamicness and inquisitiveness allows Roelofsen & Dotlačil to extend the dynamic machinery applying to indefinites in PCDRT to resolve a range of related empirical issues in questions, including mention-some and mention-all readings, pair-list readings, and uniqueness presuppositions.
This commentary focuses on their account for uniqueness presuppositions of wh-questions. According to them, the uniqueness presupposition invoked by a question with a singular which- expression results from the interaction of the maximality requirement of the which-expression and the operator forming inquisitiveness. This differs from the previous two approaches—the globalist approach, in which the uniqueness presupposition is triggered by a sentence-level op- erator (Dayal 1996; Fox 2013; Xiang 2022; a.o.), and the localist approach, in which the unique- ness presupposition is inherited from singular wh-expressions (Hirsch & Schwarz 2019; Uegaki 2021; a.o.). Roelofsen & Dotlačil show that their dynamic analysis can uniformly account for the (un)availability of uniqueness presuppositions in various questions.
Although InqD is a dynamic theory of question meaning, Roelofsen & Dotlačil (this volume) do not demonstrate its power in dealing with discourse phenomena involving questions. In this commentary, I examine InqD based on its predictions regarding uniqueness requirements of wh-questions in discourse and show that the relevant analysis in InqD is too weak. Specifically, it fails to explain why uniqueness requirements are usually attested when wh-expressions are referred to by singular pronouns. In addition, this commentary offers a generalization on the discourse conditions that allow the relevant uniqueness requirements to be obviated.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007673/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007673<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Theoretical Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>uniqueness requirement, wh-questions, discourse, dynamic inquisitive semantics, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>346 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007673">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007673">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
