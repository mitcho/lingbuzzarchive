structures evolved out from paratactic structures. In more recent times,
the parataxis-to-hypotaxis hypothesis was associated with the assumption
that syntactic structures are discourse-based. This means that hypotactic
structures evolved via syntacticization, i.e., via “a process by which flat,
paratactic discourse-pragmatic structures transform over time into tight,
hierarchic syntactic structures” (Givón 1979:82f.). One special aspect of this
assumption is that complementizers are held to have grammaticalized from
nouns, verbs, prepositions, or pronouns in bi-sentential, paratactic source
structures. In this paper, I will re-evaluate the existing evidence for the
parataxis-to-hypotaxis hypothesis with special focus on the emergence of
complementizers. The result of the re-evaluation is that in all cases, where
we have enough historical data to reconstruct the development in detail, we
have to assume a source structure that already displays subordination. In
most cases, the subordinate clause is a relative clause suggesting that relativization is probably the oldest form of subordination. The over-all result of the re-evaluation is that there is no reliable evidence at all for the parataxis-to-hypotaxis hypothesis in its current form.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006991/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006991<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Evolutionary Linguistic Theory 2:1 (2020), pp. 30–55.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>complementizer, grammaticalization, parataxis-to-hypotaxis hypothesis, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>472 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006991">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006991">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
