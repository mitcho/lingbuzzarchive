However, this is not always the case; there is no blocking in in "a man who is married to Mary". We review Alonso-Ovalle, Menéndez-Benito & Schwarz 2011, who noted the phenomenon and proposed an account in terms of the weak/strong definite distinction. We point out problems in their approach, partly based on experimental results of a rating experiment. We then propose, based on German data, that blocking occurs with functional nouns like "husband" and superlatives like "highest mountain" but not when uniqueness arises through modification by prepositional phrases and relative clauses. We give a novel explanation that relies on a syntactic attachment ambiguity between internal and external modification, which results in a semantic ambiguity in case of definites, but no such ambiguity in the case of indefinites. Under low attachment, uniqueness does not hold, and hence the definite article does not compete with the indefinite article. We also consider the case of preposed participial modifiers in German and argue that they tend towards an external modification because they are backgrounded.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007769/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007769<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Sinn & Bedeutung 27, 2023</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>definiteness, indefiniteness, uniqueness, blocking, syntactic ambiguities, superlatives, participial modifiers, syntactic ambiguities, maximize presupposition, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>174 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007769">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007769">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
