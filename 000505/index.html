This result is obtained by studying the hypothesis spaces different formulations of locality in phonology naturally define in the realm of regular languages, that is, those patterns describable with finite state machines. Locality expressed as contiguity (adjacency) restrictions provides the basis for n-gram-based patterns which describe phonotactic patterns over contiguous segments. Locality expressed as precedence---where distance between segments is not measured at all---defines a hypothesis space for long distance agreement patterns. Finally, both of these formulations of locality are shown to be subsumed by a more general formulation---that each relevant phonological environment is defined `locally' and is unique---which I call neighborhood-distinctness.





In addition to patterns over contiguous and non-contiguous segments, it is shown that all stress patterns described in recent comprehensive typologies are, for small neighborhoods, neighborhood-distinct. In fact, it is shown that 414 out of the 422 languages in the typologies have stress patterns which are neighborhood-distinct for even smaller neighborhoods called `1-1'. Furthermore, it is shown that significant classes of logically possible unattested patterns do not. Thus, 1-1 neighborhood-distinctness is hypothesized to be a universal property of phonotactic patterns, a hypothesis confirmed for all but a few stress patterns which merit further study.





It is shown that there are learners which provably learn these hypothesis spaces in the sense of Gold (1967) and which exemplify two general classes of learners: string extension and state merging. Thus the results obtained here provide techniques which allow other hypothesis spaces possibly relevant to phonology, or other cognitive domains, to be explored. Also, the hypothesis spaces and learning procedures developed here provide a basis which can be enriched with additional, substantive phonological structure. Finally, this basis is readily transferable into a variety of statistical learning procedures.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000505/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000505<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of California, Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonotactics, phonology, formal learning theory, regular languages, subregular languages, long distance agreement, n-gram, stress patterns, neighborhood-distinct</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>51 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000505">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000505">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
