It is shown that labeling plays a crucial role in the way the two interact in that unlabeled elements cannot undergo movement, cannot function as interveners, and cannot be targeted by movement. The discussion in the paper also leads to a new contextual approach to the EPP, where the satisfaction of the EPP is not tied to a particular position. This in turn is put into a broader perspective involving broader movement toward contextuality in the grammar in general: the contextuality of syntax is shown to manifest itself in the locality of movement/islandhood (there are in fact no islands as this notion has been traditionally understood—there are no phrases that by their nature, independently of their syntactic context, disallow extraction), the motivation for movement, structure building, labeling, as well as the new conception of the EPP.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005871/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005871<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Connecticut</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>merge, move, locality, epp, contextuality, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>759 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005871">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005871">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
