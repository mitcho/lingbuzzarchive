However, not all rising declaratives are used to pose a question about their content---some are used to assert the content of the declarative, while raising a second issue. In this paper, I offer a unified account of rising declaratives that seeks to explain both of these kinds of uses while positing unitary meanings for clause types and intonations. This goal cannot be achieved if we take the illocutionary force of an utterance to be completely determined by clause type and intonation, as many recent accounts have done. Instead, I propose that clause type and intonation merely constrain what a speaker could intend to do with them; pragmatic inference must play a key role in enabling an audience to uncover the speaker's illocutionary intention. In other words, there can be no hard and fast conventional discourse effects tied to particular clause type + intonation pairings. I demonstrate that the proposed account enables a derivation of assertive force, and comparisons to other recent accounts are made. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006493/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006493<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>rising declarative, assertion, question, speech act, illocutionary force, intonation, pragmatics, implicature, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006493/v3.pdf">v3 [October 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006493/v2.pdf">v2 [March 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006493/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>566 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006493">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006493">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
