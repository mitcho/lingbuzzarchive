The first is the phenomenon of spurious affrication before [u], a phenomenon in which English sequences of [tu] are rendered [tSu] in BPE as well as in English  loanwords adapted into Brazilian Portuguese. The second phenomenon we discuss is rhotic hypercorrection, a phenomenon in which English word-initial [h] is rendered in BPE as [r]. Spurious affrication and rhotic hypercorrection  present a problem for models of loanword phonology such as LaCharite and Paradis (2005), which propose that speakers map the L2 input onto the closest phonological analogue in their L1, since BP contains the sequences [tu] and initial [h] in its native phonology. These phenomena are especially interesting in light of the fact that both phonetic approximation and the orthography of English would militate against spurious affrication and rhotic hypercorrection. We propose an explanation in terms of the underlying representations (URs) that BPE speakers adopt, thereby highlighting a crucial role for URs in L2 and loanword phonology.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000380/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000380<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>rhotics, affrication, hypercorrection, brazilian portuguese, l2, loanword, underlying representation, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000380/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2007]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>556 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000380">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000380">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
