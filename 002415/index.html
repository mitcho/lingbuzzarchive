This generalization parallels what has been proposed under one approach to German focus-sensitive particles by Jacobs (1983, 1986) and Büring and Hartmann (2001) under the banner of “Closeness,” but these analyses have been controversial. This “as low as possible” behavior must result from the comparison of competing derivations, which I model using Optimality Theory. The fact that this requirement only holds within each phase shows that transderivational competition must be evaluated cyclically at each phase (Heck and Müller, 2001; Fanselow and Ćavar, 2001), and more generally offers a new kind of evidence for the idea of phase-based cyclic Spell Out (Chomsky, 2000, 2001).

In Vietnamese, I study the ‘only’ operator chỉ. Vietnamese has a morphologically rich inventory of focus-sensitive operators which makes it clear that chỉ is an adverb. In Mandarin Chinese, I study the focus marker shì and the ‘only’ operator zhǐyǒu/zhǐ. I argue that in the synchronic grammar of Mandarin, despite surface appearances, zhǐyǒu is an allomorph of zhǐ and that both shì and zhǐyǒu/zhǐ are adverbs.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002415/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002415<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002415">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002415</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>vietnamese, mandarin chinese, german, association with focus, only, adverb placement, phases, optimality theory, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1408 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002415">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002415">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
