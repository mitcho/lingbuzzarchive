The PF effect of I-Assignment is blocking the Lexical Insertion rules that otherwise would automatically apply in the maximal domain of the morphological component: morphosyntactic words. The definition of this process is given in (1):
Non-Insertion:
(1)	No Lexical Insertion Rule, IR, applies in the domain of X0, X0 a MWd, if X0, or some projection of  X0, is specified with a [+I] feature.

I-Assignment -seen as the counterpart of F-marking- is triggered by a single formal identity condition and by some structural conditions that are either syntactic or morphological. Identity is defined as a formal condition on abstract features and Roots. So, it is just strict syntactic identity. I-Assignment applies in an all the way fashion. Concretely, it can apply at every point of the derivation from syntax to PF. At syntax, I-Assignment affects phrases under syntactic conditions such as selection or c-command, whereas at morphology I-Assignment affects heads (morphosyntactic words in Embick & Noyer’ 2001 terms) under the same conditions that restrict affix hopping and other post-syntactic displacements (e.g., adjacency). The rationale behind this system is that there are no independent morphosyntactic configurations licensing ellipsis. 

I will claim that competing theories of ellipsis have to be evaluated with respect to their descriptive power for covering a broad set of apparently unrelated phenomena. I will show then that, in this regard, a cyclic theory of ellipsis with focus on the syntax/PF interface is able to provide an explicit answer to questions regarding the grammatical conditions that regulate (non)-pronunciation, the objects that can be affected by ellipsis, and the set of deducible interactions among such silent objects and other morphosyntactic phenomena. Among other set of problems, the I-Assignment system, I argue, derives (a) why a copy or a potential “null subject” has to be pronounced, even when identity is satisfied, (b) why in some cases, but not in others, agreement feeds ellipsis, (c) why phrasal copies, but not head ones, can obviate the identity condition on ellipsis, (d) why partial identity exists (e.g., vehicle change and morphological sloppy identity) and (e) why there are cases of movement in ellipsis structures that are not attested in non-elliptical contexts.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002436/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002436<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD Dissertation, University of Buenos Aires, 2008</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ellipsis, identity, licensing, copy theory of movement, null subjects, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2037 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002436">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002436">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
