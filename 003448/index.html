For example, the sentence "There could be three outcomes to this election" is normally taken to express, not that it is possible for the election to have three outcomes, but rather that there are three possibilities for what the single outcome will be. This paper proposes an analysis of such "summative" readings of existentials which pins them on a novel semantics for cardinal determiners as counting the values of an individual concept across worlds. The analysis is shown to predict the descriptive generalizations about summative existentials, including the highly restricted circumstances under which they arise, and the unorthodox semantics of cardinals it relies on is argued to be independently motivated.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003448/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003448<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Linguistic Inquiry</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>existentials, individual concepts, numerals, intensionality, scope, modality, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>321 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003448">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003448">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
