But what is the exact classification of projective content, and how do we know which type of content projects in which way? In this dissertation I argue for a composition-driven approach to projection of pieces of content that have their own nodes in the morphosyntax, and I argue that this approach applies to both spoken and gestural content. Under this approach, how a given piece of content projects is uniformly determined by how it composes in the syntax/semantics, as opposed to a variety of alternative analyses for different types of content. I show that this approach is efficient in explaining the projection behavior of a range of content types, including spoken adjectives and appositives, hand gestures, facial expressions, phi-features on pronouns, and certain iconic properties of directional hand gestures. This dissertation, thus, has two main implications. First, it offers a general economical and explanatory approach to investigating projection of compositionally integrated content. Second, it establishes the need for treating content-bearing gestures as bona fide linguistic objects at all levels of representation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004676/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004676<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD thesis, New York University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>composition, projection, modifiers, non-restricting modifiers, supplements, adjectives, appositives, gestures, facial expressions, phi-features, semantics, semantics/pragmatics, syntax/semantics, prosody/syntax/semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>596 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004676">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004676">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
