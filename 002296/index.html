Languages can also use phonetic duration to signal a different kind of meaning: emphasis (e.g., English "She's sooooo cool").  While lexical short/long contrasts are well represented in the literature, emphatic lengthening has received less attention.  A primary difference between these two uses of phonetic duration is that lexical contrasts tend to be binary distinctions, whereas emphatic lengthening can make use of more fine-grained distinctions.<br><br>

Recent studies have shown that at least some Japanese speakers can make six-way duration contrasts when they emphatically lengthen vowels (Kawahara & Braver 2013) and consonants (Kawahara & Braver 2014).  One question that remains is whether native language plays a role in speakers' ability to produce such fine-grained distinctions: are Japanese speakers in a better position to make such distinctions because their native language has a binary length contrast?<br><br>

In this paper, we present an experiment which shows that some speakers of English (a language without a lexical length contrast) are able to produce fine-grained durational distinctions, just like Japanese speakers<br><br>

These results support two claims.  First, we argue that speaking a language with a native binary lexical length distinction is not necessary for the production of fine-grained durational differences.  Further, we argue that the cross-linguistic preference for binary (as opposed to, e.g. ternary or quaternary) duration contrasts is not due solely to restrictions on production.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002296/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002296<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the 2014 Annual Meeting on Phonology</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>english, phonetics, duration, emphasis, (non)-binarity, phonology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1433 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002296">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002296">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
