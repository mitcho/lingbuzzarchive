While the language communities are not the
primary object of the study of GL, more and more data are being collected from different languages with the aim to come to solid generalizations. How important is it to consider the viewpoint of the speaker, for generative grammar? Is it really true that the speaker is neglected? 
Our chapter starts by challenging the statements according to which GL practice is oblivious of ethical concerns; we show how in fact the generative methodology is sometimes more "ethically oriented" and inclusive than other methodologies: the need for a small number of speakers gives minorities the same prominence as major languages; asking for the speaker's intuitions puts the "owner" of the language at the very center of linguistic investigation, etc. Then, the chapter analyzes the shortcomings in the GL practice and sets to offer an overview of the main issues and best practices in data collection for generative grammar, with a focus on heritage and minority varieties of Indo-Aryan, Romance, and Germanic in India, Latin America and the US, respectively.
