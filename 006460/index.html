Yet there remains a lack of consensus on why vowels preceding voiced obstruents should be longer than vowels preceding voiceless obstruents. In this paper we provide an extensive review of roughly seventy years of literature, an analysis of the voicing effect in a corpus of natural speech, and production data from a metronome-timed word repetition study. From this evidence we conclude that: vowel duration differences follow from consonant duration differences; the voicing effect is largely limited to words of especially long duration; and preceding vowel duration does not reliably cue obstruent voicing under the following circumstances: when obstruent voicing or duration cues conflict; for lax or unstressed vowels; and for most conversational speech. We show that this behavior can be modeled using a competing-constraints framework, where all segments resist expanding or compressing past a preferred duration. Inherent segment elasticity determines the degree of resistance, and duration is ultimately determined by the interaction of these segmental constraints with constraints on target rhyme duration (as a measure of speaking rate), and a preferred C/V duration ratio. Because these constraints are implemented as continuous probability distributions, under- and over- shoot of target duration is possible, and explicit temporal compensation is not required. This account of the voicing effect has a number of implications for phonological theory, especially the central role that the concept of prominence plays in the analysis of underlying features.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006460/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006460<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>vowel lengthening, final lengthening, temporal compensation, laryngeal contrasts, lab speech, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006460/v2.pdf">v2 [May 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006460/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>447 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006460">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006460">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
