Yet there remains a lack of consensus on why vowels preceding voiced obstruents would be longer than vowels preceding voiceless obstruents. In this paper we provide an extensive review of over fifty years of literature, an analysis of the voicing effect in a corpus of natural speech, and production data from a metronome-timed word repetition study. From this evidence we conclude: that vowel duration differences follow from consonant duration differences; that the voicing effect is largely limited to words of especially long duration; and that preceding vowel duration does not cue obstruent voicing under the following circumstances: when obstruent voicing or duration cues conflict; for lax or unstressed vowels; and for most conversational speech (over 90% of our sample of CVC words). We show that this behavior can be modeled within a competing-constraints framework, where all segments resist expanding or compressing past a preferred duration. Inherent segment elasticity determines the degree of resistance, and duration is ultimately determined by the interaction of these segmental constraints with constraints on target rhyme duration (as a function of rate), and preferred C/V duration ratio. Because these constraints are implemented as probability distributions, under- and over- shoot of target durations is possible, and explicit compensation is not required. This account of the voicing effect has a number of implications for phonological theory, especially the central role that the concept of prominence plays in the analysis of underlying features.
