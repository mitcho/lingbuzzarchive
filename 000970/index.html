<br><br>

After working through de Lacy's handbook in the perspective of a classical review, it is argued that the ambition/self-understanding/perception of OT as a theory of grammar, or of phonology, is misguided. That is, OT is a specific theory of computation (parallel, promoting ranked and violable constraints), but phonology does not reduce to computation (even if this seems to be where the OT mainstream goes, which is documented in the handbook): there are representations, there is the lexicon, there is contrast, and OT per se has got nothing to say about these. Grammar as such of course does not reduce to computation either: extending the parallel ambition to the communication between grammatical modules (phonology, morpho-syntax, semantics) is a mistake: OT claims that computation is parallel, but computation occurs within a computational unit (a module), not among them.

<br>This leads to two tropes that characterizes OT: the trend to scramble all into one single constraint chamber (phonetics, phonology, morphology, sometimes even syntax), and the trend to have everything accounted for only by computation. Making distinct things indistinct is blurring or doing away with modular contours - the modular architecture however belongs to the generative core. The promotion of indistinction roots in the non-generative (and non-rationalist) part of OT's genetic endowment: connectionism.

Below is the conclusion of the paper.

5. Conclusion: a lot of things that OT is not

<br>At bottom, then, what is OT? It is NOT a theory of representations (there are no genuine OT representations). It is NOT a theory of the architecture of grammar (most versions fall prey to the anti-modular scrambling trope, but there are also modular implementations). It is NOT a complete theory of grammar (there are versions of OT that subtract certain decisions from the constraint chamber, for example by transferring them to representations and/or restrictions on GEN). It is NOT an anti-derivational theory (only computation must be parallel; the communication among computational systems may well be serial). It is NOT a theory of the lexicon (there are versions of OT where Richness of the Base plays no role, i.e. where lexical entries may or even have to be specific in one way or another, cf. Blaho et al. 2007). It is NOT a functionalist theory (building functionalist content into constraints is a private decision made by the analyst). 

<br>OT is a theory of computation which holds that computation is parallel, and that it is based on ranked and violable constraints. All the rest is a matter of private decision, which however is oriented by the two tropes which belong to the theorys genetic endowement: the trope for scrambling and for being content-free. Both embody an invitation to expand OT's competence: to relationships among computational systems and to representations. And both expansions are unwarranted: OT is not a theory of grammar, and OT cannot replace representations by (parallel) computation. Computation needs something to work on, and this something must be ontologically independent: rather than being a function of computation (emergent), representations must exist in their own right and contribute a sovereign (i.e. unoutrankable) arbitral award to the definition of grammaticality.

<br>The scope and self-understanding of OT thus needs to be shrunk: rather than BEING the grammar, OT is just a piece of it, namely the grammatical device that defines how computation works. All other pieces  the lexicon, representations, the general architecture  are subject to independent assessment and choice. 

In his introductory chapter (14ff.), de Lacy reviews the advantages of parallel over serial computation: a better way of handling ordering paradoxes, global conditions, conspiracy.  This is where the debate between OT and theories of serial computation should lie, and this is what OT has contributed to the field. All other debates must be conducted independently. It is unfortunate that the field of phonology, and hence its reflection in the handbook, gives the appearance of being empiricist, functionalist, representation-unfriendly and non-modular as a consequence of OT. Poor OT is not responsible for any of these properties, even if it has to struggle against its genetic predisposition for the indiscriminate promotion of indistinction and computation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000970/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000970<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonology, architecture of grammar, ot, representations, computation, connectionism, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>198 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000970">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000970">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
