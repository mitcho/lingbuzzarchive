Based on possibly surprising instances of ungrammaticality from language acquisition and dialect geography, this paper shows, first, that dealing with cases of absolute ungrammaticality is not easy for other phonological theories either, in spite of appearances. Secondly, there is evidence that children sometimes refuse to produce forms which they arguably know, showing the reality of ineffability in a domain very different from pardigm gaps. Thirdly, a suprising case of ‘relative ungrammaticality’ is discussed — some forms are more grammatical than others — which cannot easily be accounted for in other models of grammar, which tend to be ‘all or nothing’. All of these point to a refinement of the notion of grammaticality which can be formalized in a version of OT that has similarities to OT syntax and
