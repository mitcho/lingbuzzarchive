grammatical variation phenomenon between near-synonymous constructions. We
investigate a particular variation phenomenon, word order variation in Dutch
two-verb clusters, where it has been established that word order choice is
affected by processing cost. Several multifactorial corpus studies of Dutch
verb clusters have used other measures of processing complexity to show that
this factor affects word order choice. This previous work allows us to compare
the surprisal measure, which is based on constraint satisfaction theories of
language modeling, to those previously used measures, which are more directly
linked to empirical observations of processing complexity. Our results show
that surprisal does not predict the word order choice by itself, but is a
significant predictor when used in a measure of uniform information density
(UID). This lends support to the view that human language processing is
facilitated not so much by predictable sequences of words but more by sequences
of words in which information is spread evenly.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003252/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003252<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the first workshop on Computational Linguistics for Linguistic Complexity (CL4LC)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>processing hypothesis, processing complexity, language processing, word order, variation, trigram model, surprisal, dutch, verb cluster, information density, uniform information density, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>512 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003252">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003252">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
