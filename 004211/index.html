The VICTR Hierarchy is a hierarchy of functional heads corresponding to the part of the clause generally known in the minimalist literature as â€˜vPâ€™ or the â€˜thematic domainâ€™. Nominal arguments are merged in the specifiers of one or more of these heads and receive their thematic interpretations on the basis of their merged positions. Evidence for a model of thematic roles and syntactic argument structure based in the VICTR Hierarchy is presented for a range of domains, with a focus on split intransitivity, explored in regard to a  range of split intransitive diagnostics in English (e.g. out-prefixation, the resultative construction), auxiliary selection patterns in Western European languages, and split intransitive case and agreement systems. A formal account of the case and agreement patterns in these latter languages based in the VICTR hierarchy is presented, derived in part from the inherent case theory of ergativity (Legate 2002, Aldridge
2004 and others) and drawing on a detailed typology, followed by analysis of the semantic basis of split intransitive alignment in two languages, Basque and Georgian. The VICTR approach is compared throughout to the proposals of Perlmutter (1978) and Ramchand (2008). Much support, with some caveats, is also found in the data considered for the applicability of Soraceâ€™s (2000) Auxiliary Selection Hierarchy (ASH) to a range of split intransitive phenomena cross-linguistically.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004211/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004211<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Cambridge PhD thesis</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>split intransitivity, unaccusativity, english, georgian, basque, split-s, auxiliary selection, case, agreement, ergativity, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004211/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>513 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004211">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004211">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
