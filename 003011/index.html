specific language impairment (SLI) and peers with typical language development (TLD). Experimental
data come from picture-naming and retell narratives. Fourteen school-aged children with SLI (mean
age = 6 years, 9 months) participated alongside 50 language- and age-matched peers with TLD. The
results revealed that children with SLI do not use light verb constructions but only general all-purpose
(GAP) verbs when unable to produce single-word, specific lexical verbs. Moreover, they do not differ
from language-matched TLD children in this respect. As such, GAP verbs should be viewed as symptoms
of immature language or absent representations rather than impaired language. Consequently,
when discussing not fully lexical verbs productions in (a)typical development, researchers should
make the fundamental distinction between GAP verbs and light verbs, and focus on GAP verbs as the
relevant category in SLI.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003011/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003011<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Applied Psycholinguistics 36 (2015), 1029–1057, doi:10.1017/S0142716414000034</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>(discrete) bilectalism; general all-purpose verbs; light verbs; not fully lexical verbs; picture-naming; specific language impairment; typical language development, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1693 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003011">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003011">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
