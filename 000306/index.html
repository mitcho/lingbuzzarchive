Fake Indexicals as Windows Into the Properties of Pronouns</a></b></font><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000306">Angelika Kratzer</a><br/>December 2007</center>&nbsp;<p></p>The paper challenges the widely accepted belief that the relation between a bound variable pronoun and its antecedent is not necessarily submitted to locality constraints. It argues that the locality constraints for bound variable pronouns that are not explicitly marked as such are often hard to detect because of (a) alternative strategies that produce the illusion of true bound variable interpretations and (b) language specific spell-out noise that obscures the presence of agreement chains. To identify and control for those interfering factors, the paper focuses on fake indexicals, 1st or 2nd person pronouns with bound variable interpretations. Following up on Kratzer (1998), I argue that (non-logophoric) fake indexicals are born with an incomplete set of features and acquire the remaining features via chains of local agreement relations established in the syntax. If fake indexicals are born with an incomplete set of features, we need a principled account of what those features are. The paper derives such an account from a semantic theory of pronominal features that is in line with contemporary typological work on possible pronominal paradigms.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000306/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000306<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000306">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000306</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Inquiry 40(2), 2009 (substantially revised)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pronouns, pronominal features, fake indexicals, pronoun typology, bound variables, fake indexicals, syntax, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000306/v3.pdf">v3 [December 2007]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000306/v2.pdf">v2 [December 2007]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000306/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2006]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>314 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000306">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000306">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
