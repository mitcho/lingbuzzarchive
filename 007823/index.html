There are two layers involved in answering a wh-question: (i) its maximally informative analytical answer (which is analytical and world-independent) plus (ii) additional information (which can be various kinds of world-dependent information).

This proposal is in the same spirit as Karttunen (1977)’s view that a question denotes its true answers and Dayal 1996’s view that a wh-question presupposes the existence of a maximally informative true answer. I show that a good wh-question always has a maximally informative analytical answer, which is true and complete and can be considered equal to the question meaning and constitutes the first layer of the answerhood. Built on this first layer, a typical, acceptable short answer contributes a second layer that provides additional information. Thus, a question like ’who smiled’ yields an analytically complete true answer: ‘the one(s) who smiled’. A short answer like ‘Melody and Khloe’ contributes further information about this definite item: ‘the one(s) who smiled’ is identical to (or includes) the sum Melody⊕Khloe.

Inspired by the works of Brasoveanu (2013), Charlow (2014, 2017), Bumford (2017) on phenomena that demonstrate split (or multi-layered) semantics (e.g., cumulative-reading sentences, Haddock descriptions), I consider the ‘two-layered answerhood’ similar to post-suppositional phenomena and implement the proposed perspective within dynamic semantics. I show that the two layers involved in answering a wh-question correspond to (i) non-local, relativized definiteness and (ii) cardinality in a cumulative-reading sentence. I analyze various question-related phenomena with the proposed perspective and discuss theoretical implications, especially with regard to (i) L-analyticity (see Gajewski 2002/2016, Abrusa ́n 2014) as the driving force behind question interpretation and (ii) the distinction between an answer-based vs. an issue-based perspective on wh-clauses.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007823/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007823<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>wh-questions, answers, short answers, dynamic semantics, definiteness, uniqueness, maximality, informativeness, post-suppositions, split semantics, modified numerals, cumulative reading, wh-items, degree questions, qud, issues, l-analyticity, embedded questions, mention-some questions, multi-wh-questions, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007823/v3.pdf">v3 [January 2024]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/007823/v2.pdf">v2 [January 2024]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/007823/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2024]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>477 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007823">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007823">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
