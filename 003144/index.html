It is a general observation that NN compounds are productive in Germanic languages, but unproductive in Romance languages. In this paper, we will try to look at this contrast by examining NN compounds in English and Romanian.
The paper is structured as follows. In Chapter 1, we present the various types of NN compounds existing in English and in Romanian, and we show that, while NN compounds are numerous in English, they are rather scarce in Romanian, where, instead of the NN pattern (sunflower, rattle snake), we find either the N+N in the Genitive pattern (floarea soarelui ‘flower-the sun-GEN’, i.e. ‘sunflower’) or the N+ de/ cu (‘of/ with’)+ N pattern (şarpe cu clopoţei ‘snake with rattles’, i.e. ‘rattlesnake’).
In Chapter 2, we discuss various syntactic representations that have been proposed for NN compounds in English. What these syntactic representations show very clearly is the fact that NN compounds are not linear strings of nouns, but they are hierarchically organized.
Chapter 3 deals with the acquisition of NN compounds in English and Romanian. In the case of English, we relied on longitudinal and experimental data as reported in previous studies, showing the productivity of NN compounds in child English. In the case of Romanian, we devised experiments in which we tested the comprehension of NN sequences by children and adults, and the production of NN compounds by children and adults. In the comprehension test, we asked the subjects to choose out of a range of four drawings that which they thought best fitted the NN sequence they heard (e. g. broască porc (lit. ‘pig frog’), cȃine măgar (lit. ‘dog donkey’)). The drawings correspond to four possible interpretations of the NN sequence: both animals, a hybrid creature (half one animal, half another), the first animal with the attributes of the second, the second animal with the attributes of the first. Given the fact that there are few NN compounds in Romanian and that the other patterns take care of the endocentric interpretations, we would expect the hybrid creature interpretation to be the dominant one. Indeed, the prediction is confirmed by the results of the experiment. In the production experiment, we showed the subjects pictures made of halves (half an animal, half another), and we asked them to name the creature. While Romanian adults opted for NN compounds almost exclusively, very few children did so, unlike in English, where NN compounds are productive from early on. The experiments thus reveal that, although NN compounds do exist in child Romanian, they are not as productive as in child English.
Finally, in Chapter 4, we try to provide an account for the reason why NN compounds are productive in English, but not productive in Romanian. To this purpose, we have evaluated various accounts. On the Compounding Parameter account (Snyder 1995), the reason for the lack of productivity of NN compounds in Romanian is the fact that Romanian has a negative setting for the Compounding parameter, a parameter which is responsible both for the occurrence of NN compounds and of complex predicate constructions (such as resultatives). On the Rich vs. Poor Morphology Account (starting from Di Sciullo 2005), the reason for which Romanian has few NN compounds is related to the fact that it is a language with rich morphology, and so, its compounds are formed in the domain of syntax, escaping thus the NN pattern. On the Case Account, the reason is the fact that, in Romanian, there can be no caseless nouns. On the Noun Movement Account, the presence of the patterns N+N in the Genitive and N+ de/ cu (‘of/ with’)+ N can be explained by the fact that nouns always move out of the N0 position in Romanian, while this is not the case in English. We have tried to show that, while the Compounding Parameter account is problematic (it assumes, for example, that more or less the same mechanism is at stake both in the formation of compounds and in the formation of resultatives), and there are serious counterarguments against the Rich vs. Poor Morphology account (German, for instance, is a language with rich morphology, but, in spite of this, it does have NN compounds), the accounts which seem to be more able to cope with the issue of productivity versus lack of productivity of NN compounds are the Case Account and the Noun Movement account. Moreover, the two accounts can be related given the fact that case assignment usually involves noun movement.
The paper thus brings experimental evidence in favour of the fact that Romanian NN compounds are not productive and tries to come up with an account for why this is so.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003144/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003144<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>unpublished </td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>root nn compounds, productivity, acquisition, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>663 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003144">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003144">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
