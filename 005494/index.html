It was brought about by the publication of a book review by one of the authors of the exchange (https://inference-review.com/article/just-a-thought), which in turn was brought about by the publication of a book (https://global.oup.com/academic/product/inner-speech-
9780198796640?cc=gb&lang=en&#). The two pieces were meant for publication elsewhere, but they have ended up here.
