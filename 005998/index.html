The semantic connections between nouns and other categories are also the focus of this paper. We introduce semantic types and their uses for analysing `extrinsic' function-argument relations in English and Warlpiri. Extrinsic typing does not distinguish nouns from verbs, adjectives and prepositions. Rather, these categories are distinguished by their phrase-internal semantic arguments, which play a central role in modification. Modifiers allow us to characterize category-specific semantic arguments for verbs (states and events), adjectives (degrees) and prepositions (spatial objects). Other than exceptional cases like incorporation in Chamorro, only such `intrinsic’ arguments are modified in non-nominal categories. Nouns, by contrast, are assumed to have no intrinsic semantic arguments, and their extrinsic argument is also used for modification. Another important semantic distinction between categories is the ability of nouns to restrict quantificational domains. We illustrate this property by the disambiguation of noun/verb words in Hebrew. Further challenges for the idea that nouns introduce identity criteria are discussed, and we review on-going attempts to address them. Lastly, we review the semantics of nouns in relation to their ability to refer to kinds and mass substances. This shows the intimate relation between mass terms and property expressions, which affects the choices that languages make when manifesting property meanings as adjectival (most European languages) or nominal (Bisa, Hausa, and Basaá, among other languages).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005998/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005998<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in The Oxford Handbook of Word Classes (E. van Lier, ed.)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>categories, semantics, types, lexicon, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005998/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>664 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005998">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005998">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
