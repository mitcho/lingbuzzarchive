However, such a derivation is possible if the structure of a proposition is enriched. In this paper, I argue that the sentential denotation in dynamic semantics has enough structure to support the retrieval of short answers from full answers. Specifically, WH-expressions have dynamic discourse contributions in the sense of introducing discourse referents (drefs), as evidenced by their ability to support cross-sentential anaphora. Correspondingly, a WH-question denotes a set of dynamic propositions, each of which not only has propositional content but also is associated with a dref introduced by the WH-expression. These drefs can be retrieved to model short answers. In addition to proposing a new way for deriving short answers, this paper also demonstrates the usefulness of this way for analyzing a non-canonical WH-construction in Mandarin known as WH-conditionals. In particular, I analyze WH-conditionals as quantification over short answers derived from dynamicized Hamblin sets. This approach to WH-conditionals is compared with previous studies based on the categorial approach and is argued to be more adequate.
