Instead the difficulty associated with constructing non-clause-bound inverse scope interpretations is attributed to increased processing costs arising for covert (but not overt) movement, which is calculated based on the complexity of the structure, specifically the number of syntactic domains crossed. Based on the results of several experimental studies, speakers’ acceptance of QR from different types of clausal complements is shown to be gradient, yielding a scale of difficulty which tracks syntactic complexity defined over a clausal sub-domains. An ac-count is proposed that derives the acceptability patterns of QR from different types of infinitives and finite clauses, as well as certain differences between QR in QP»QP contexts and QR in antecedent-contained deletion contexts.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002599/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002599<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>qr, scope economy, clause-boundedness, locality, infinitives, restructuring, gradience, acd, processing, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002599/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2823 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002599">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002599">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
