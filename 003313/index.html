Superficially, structures of this type - which are very commonly attested cross-linguistically - violate the Final-over-Final Condition (previously, the Final-over-Final Constraint; see i.a. Biberauer, Holmberg, Roberts 2008, 2014, Sheehan 2013). Here I start with an overview of the types of apparently FOFC-violating structures found in the particle domain. Thereafter, I introduce the formal configurations that would give rise to superficially FOFC-violating structures without actually violating the version of this Condition in Biberauer, Holmberg & Roberts (2014), i.e. that which, crucially, references extended projections. All of these configurations are shown to exist. I conclude with consideration of what the particle-derived insights reveal about the nature of FOFC, and about the fractal make-up of human language more generally. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003313/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003313<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>The Final-over-Final Condition: A Syntactic Universal (to appear with MIT Press in 2017)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>word order, extended projection, final-over-final condition, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1297 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003313">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003313">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
