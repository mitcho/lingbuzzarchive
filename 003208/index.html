And this has consequences: words we decide <em>not</em> to pronounce have critical effects on the messages we end up conveying. For instance, in saying <em>Chris is a good teacher</em>, we may convey that Chris is not an <em>amazing</em> teacher. How this happens is an unsolvable problem, unless a theory of <em>alternatives</em> indicates what counts, among all the things that have not been pronounced. It is sometimes assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that any word counts, as long as that word could have replaced one that was actually pronounced. We review arguments against this powerful idea. In doing so, we argue that the level of words is not the right level of analysis for alternatives. Instead, we capitalize on recent conceptual and associated methodological advances within the study of the so-called "language of thought" to reopen the problem from a new perspective. Specifically, we provide theoretical and experimental arguments that the relation between alternatives and words may be indirect, and that alternatives are not linguistic objects in the traditional sense. Rather, we propose that competition in language is better seen as primarily determined by general reasoning preferences, or thought preferences (preferences which may have forged the lexicons of modern languages in the first place, as argued elsewhere). We propose that such non-linguistic preferences can be measured and that these measures can be used to explain linguistic competition, non-linguistically, and more in depth.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003208/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003208<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>concepts, language of thought, formal semantics, linguistic competition, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003208/v2.pdf">v2 [March 2018]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003208/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1272 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003208">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003208">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
