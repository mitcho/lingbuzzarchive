For instance, the competition between sentences such as <em>Some of the shapes are red</em> and <em>All the shapes are red</em> is taken to explain why an utterance of the former implicates that the latter is false. It is generally assumed that such competition is regulated by the relative syntactic simplicity of the competing utterances. Using theoretical and experimental tools devised to study human non-linguistic, conceptual abilities, we provide evidence for a new perspective: the rules that govern competition in natural language may be better and more deeply understood as rooted in relative <em>conceptual</em> simplicity, and thus are inherited from non-linguistic domains. We also provide evidence that the various construals of numerals preferentially attested in human language may likewise be rooted in non-linguistic, conceptual preferences.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003208/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003208<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>concepts, language of thought, formal semantics, linguistic competition, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>523 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003208">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003208">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
