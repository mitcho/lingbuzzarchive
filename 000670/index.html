The article presents an argument that both prosodic principles and narrow-syntactic principles play a role in the linearization of syntactic structures. I take Richard Kaynes (1994) Linear Correspondence Axiom as a starting point: (asymmetric) c-command maps onto precedence relations. Two wide-ranging consequences of Kaynes theory are that specs precede their heads and that a head can only have one spec or adjunct. Although there is abundant evidence to support these predictions, there is nonetheless a well-known class of apparent counterexamples: dislocations in the Romance languages can be rightward and multiple. I take the LCA to be a soft constraint, overruled by a constraint of the WRAP family that seeks to phrase together a verb and its extended projection in one intonational phrase. Apparent rightward movement is the outcome of right linearization forced by WRAP. The possibility of having multiple dislocations is shown to be compatible with the LCA within the assumptions made in this article.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000670/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000670<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Inquiry (forthcoming Spring 2009)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>lca, dislocations, wrap, prosody, romance, spanish, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>652 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000670">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000670">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
