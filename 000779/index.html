Our answer is nothing. We show that wh-phrases are not inherently interrogative and do not participate in clause-typing in any way. In terms of the proposed analysis, wh-phrases do not embed an interrogative feature that can be checked against Inter. Instead, we argue that the outer functional layer of yes-no questions and wh-questions involves InterP, which encodes interrogative force and clause-types the sentence as required by the Clausal Typing Hypothesis (Cheng 1991). More precisely, we suggest that wh-questions involve a question particle (distinct from wh-phrases) that merges in Inter or in SpecInterP. The proposed analysis therefore dissociates wh-movement from clause-typing in suggesting that, in languages where wh-phrases occur in wh-questions, they do so for interpretive reasons other than clause typing. Following this line of reasoning, we further demonstrate that wh-movement per se is dependent on the structural make-up of the wh-phrase, that is, whether it embeds a quantificational feature that can be
