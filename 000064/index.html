It is argued that dative arguments introduced by 'se' occur in double object benefactive and goal constructions and in prepositional goal ditransitives, unlike 'to' in English which is limited to prepositional goal constructions. This difference between Greek and English is accounted for in terms of differences between 'se' and 'to' with respect to the feature DIRECTION/ PATH and the related function of resultativity. Greek 'se'-datives are compared to arguments introduced by comparable prepositions in Japanese, French and Spanish. It is demonstrated that the meaning, distribution and syntactic properties of 'a'-datives in French are very similar to those displayed by 'se'-datives, except that the former behave like DPs and the latter like PPs under co-ordination. This leads to the conclusion that the category of indirect objects is orthogonal to their distribution in ditransitives. Indirect object DPs may occur in so called prepositional ditransitives and, conversely, indirect object PPs are allowed to surface in double object constructions. The crucial property of the double object construction is the fact that the indirect object is introduced by a light applicative head and the direct object is part of the domain headed by the verbal root (Marantz 1993). This extra layer of functional structure is missing in so called prepositional ditransitives where indirect and direct objects are both introduced at the root level.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000064/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000064<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Melita Stavrou and Arhonto Terzi (Eds.)
