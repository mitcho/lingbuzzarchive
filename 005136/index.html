Multiple-merge theories of movement pose known challenges for the semantic interpretation of quantifier raising, as there are no variable-denoting traces in lower positions. The most common means of resolving this conundrum is trace conversion (Fox 2002, 2003), in which either a syntactic operation makes alterations at lower merge sites in order to generate trace-like interpretations, or the semantics behaves as if such a syntactic operation had occurred. In this paper, I discuss problems faced by presently formulated versions of trace conversion: the syntactic variant requires undesirable countercyclic insertion, while the semantic variant violates principles of compositionality. I propose an alternative, "compositional trace conversion", in which multiple-merge structures can be directly interpreted in a straightforwardly compositional manner. This approach is shown to generalize well, extending to modals and degree phrases as well as DPs.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005136/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005136<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted for peer review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>scope, copy theory, multidominance, quantifiers, modals, comparatives, trace conversion, compositionality, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>141 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005136">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005136">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
