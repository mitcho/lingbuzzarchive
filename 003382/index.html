Building on Hernanz (2007 and subsequent work), we propose that sí, which marks focal affirmative polarity, originates in ΣP and then moves to FocusP. By contrast, sí que is directly merged in AssertiveP in the left periphery, since it emphasizes the truth of the proposition. Thus, we argue that sí que involves more CP structure than sí, which makes a variety of correct empirical predictions. Additionally, several facts indicate that sí que behaves much like a predicate of truth, which further substantiates the AssertiveP analysis advocated here. We then investigate the possibility that que in such contexts also performs an echoic function, along the lines of Demonte & Fernández-Soriano (2014). More generally, the findings reported here allow us to draw a more accurate mapping of the Spanish left periphery, a topic of much discussion in the Romance literature.
