They present a rare mismatch where different elements occupy SpecvP and SpecTP, which is shown to have consequences for the treatment of subject-oriented anaphors, anti-subject oriented pronouns and anaphor binding more generally, including agreement approaches to it and logophoricity.  

Agreement patterns in such constructions are shown to provide evidence that TPs can trigger agreement and that the following scenario is possible: X probes Y, then X moves up and probes Z from a higher position, with the features of Z realized on X. 

Such constructions are also shown to provide a new type of argument for the VP internal subject hypothesis and shed light on the precise locus of subject agreement. The behavior of Japanese object honorification in such constructions is also discussed, and shown to have consequences for the proper analysis of ATB.  <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006706/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006706<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Proceedings of WCCFL 40</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>subject-oriented anaphors, logophors, anti-subject oriented pronouns, agreement, agree, coordination, vp internal subject hypothesis, across-the-board movement, honorification, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006706/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1055 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006706">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006706">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
