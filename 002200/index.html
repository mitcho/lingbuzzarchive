Contrary to what has been previously proposed by Brovetto (2002), it is shown that complementizerless clauses cannot be analyzed as IP complements. The analysis advocated in this paper is that, just like sentences introduced by "que", complementizerless clauses also present a left periphery layer, albeit with an important difference. Based on the cartographic view of the C-system (Rizzi 1997), it is argued that the particularity of complementizerless clauses is that, differently from sentences where the complementizer is overtly realized, the peripheral heads Force and Fin are projected in a syncretic way.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002200/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002200<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Selected Proceedings of the 16th Hispanic Linguistics Symposium</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>left periphery, complementizerless clauses, verb movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>782 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002200">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002200">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
