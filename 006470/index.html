I present a case study of linking elements in Dutch which do fulfil a morphosyntactic role. I note first that when ‘linking elements’ are of this type, the linguist should be aware of the fact that they may be null morphemes. I show that, indeed, Dutch may have such a null affix in its inventory. I then argue that the Dutch linking elements are in fact noun class markers and as such, I derive the fact that two of them are identical to plural marking through cumulative exponence. I point out that these noun classes co-exist with gender marking and may cause so-called erroneous reference. The analysis shows that a careful study of such elements provides us with new insights into two domains simultaneously. Firstly, we learn more about the morphosyntax of the compound’s left-hand part, the structure of the compound itself and the inventory of compounding types in the language. The importance of the left-hand part cannot be underestimated in my opinion. It is a unique domain: it shows how a category behaves functionally in the absence of functional material that guarantees reference, such as number and the D-layer. As such, we learn, secondly, something about the morphosyntax of a category. In this contribution it appears that the Dutch nominal domain has nominal classes which are less visible in the nominal group as they are syncretic with number marking. Take away number marking and they become visible.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006470/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006470<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ackema, P., Bendjaballah S., Bonet E. and Fábregas, A.
