We attempt to capture five-year-old English passivization behavior via a probabilistic learning strategy that relies on the frequencies of features associated with individual verbs in children’s input. We implement this with a Bayesian developmental model, where children’s prior beliefs and abilities associated with the passive structure also impact their observed passivization behavior. We (i) identify how English children may be integrating lexical feature frequency information when learning which verbs are passivizable by age five, and (ii) find that children may not be harnessing all of the information available to them in the input. Our results also suggest that, if children do indeed learn to passivize this way, five-year-olds may not perceive the passive structure as very costly a priori. We conclude with discussion of the implications for language development, and future computational and experimental directions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004424/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004424<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>BUCLD 43 proceedings</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language acquisition, passives, english, developmental modeling, input filtering, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>186 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004424">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004424">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
