It consists of a series of GR backbones, which hold the arguments,  cases and agreement morphemes, and they are laid out as a sine wave. The representation is referred to as a 'pool', where relevant elements can exchange case and agreement morphemes under a strict Universal Linking Convention, plus a Well-formedness Condition. The Pool Theory shows that the ergative and the absolutive case are respectively the nominative and the accusative case, and that ergativity, which appears to be an undesirable trait, can only appear if the subject and the object show an asymmetry induced by the missing of the accusative morpheme in an otherwise rich case system. Data from various languages, including Basque, Dyirbal, Hindi-Urdu, Korean, and Warlpiri are thoroughly accounted for under the Pool Theory. It appears that Dyirbal, traditionally considered the archetypal ergative language, in which the case system is split in two interlocked subsystems by a feature mismatch, provides one of the strongest theory-free evidence against the existence of a sui generis ergative and absolutive case.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001655/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001655<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>DRAFT</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>nez perce, agreement, antipassive, argument, case stacking, case, concordance, double case construction, feature, grammatical relations, harmonization, linearization, linking, passive, psych-verb, scalar, sinusoid, symbiosis, vector.</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001655/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2012]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1034 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001655">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001655">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
