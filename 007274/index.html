Though this distribution does not allow for easy identification of an underlying form via an elsewhere case analysis, researchers typically derive the dark allophone from velarization or lenition of an underlying light coronal l in syllable codas (e.g. Sproat and Fujimura 1993, Browman and Goldstein 1995). 
	The present paper expands on the finding by Hayes 2000, Jensen 2000, Wrench and Scobbie 2003, Oxley et al. 2006, Scobbie et al. 2007, Foulkes and Docherty 2007, and Scobbie and Pouplier 2010 that the phonological and phonetic relationships between light and dark L are typically more complex than this, both within and across speakers. In order to investigate the phonological dimensions of this complexity we conducted a study of 383 speakers of English along 24 prosodic and segmental parameters. Building on Gallistel et al.'s 2004 finding that averaging over individuals produces illusorily gradient results that obscure the categorical behavior of individuals, we analysed our results in terms of individual grammars and rule components rather than blindly averaging over the outputs of all grammars. Our results revealed 325 distinct grammars, with significant interspeaker variation for many of the environments tested. Within this set, the most common grammars had (i) all light L, (ii) all dark L, or (iii) the classic onset/rime distribution. Less common patterns revealed participation of a wide range of other phonological factors, including ambisyllabicity, vowel backness and height, onset complexity and place of articulation, and cyclicity.
	Our findings suggest that (i) the distribution of light and dark L shows extensive nanovariation, both phonetically and phonologically; (ii) this variation displays categorical phonological properties that are wrongly seen as gradient by studies such as Boersma and Hayes 2001 that average across subjects; and (iii) the attested range of variation is consistent with a model of phonological acquisition in which learners choose from a fairly large range of PLD-compatible hypotheses assembled from combinations of a limited number of phonological elements.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007274/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007274<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Old World Conference on Phonology, London</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>english, phonetics, phonology, light l, dark l, allophony, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007274/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>479 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007274">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007274">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
