According to the dominant view, correlatives are essentially (free) relative clauses attached in a non-canonical left-peripheral position (Srivastav 1991, Bhatt 2003, Liptak 2004). A competing view holds that correlatives are akin to conditional antecedents (Bittner 2001, Brasoveanu 2008). Since conditionals are known to be acquired earlier than relative clauses (Reilly 1986, Diessel 2004), L1-acquisition of correlatives has a chance of shedding new light on the theoretical controversy. We have designed a sentence imitation experiment and tested Czech preschool children in their ability to imitate correlatives and string-identical light-headed relatives, which differ only in their position: correlatives are left-peripheral and light-headed relatives are right-peripheral. Our results support the correlatives-as-conditionals analysis: correlatives received similar scores as conditionals and at the same time were significanlty easier to imitate than the corresopnding light-headed relatives.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007086/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007086<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>BUCLD 47 proceedings</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>correlatives, free relatives, relatives, l1-acquisition, sentence imitation experiment, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>359 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007086">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007086">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
