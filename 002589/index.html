subject-preference in long-distance dependency formation, both in terms of processing
(in particular, subject gaps in relative clauses are processed more easily than
other types of gaps) and accesibility for extraction (there appears to be an implicational
universal that the availability of relativization with a gap entails the availability
of subject relativization with a gap (Keenan and Comrie 1977)). This subject
preference does not, however, carry over uniformly to languages with ergativeabsolutive
alignment; in some morphologically ergative languages, the ergative subject
cannot extract with a gap at the extraction site, a phenomenon termed syntactic
ergativity. In this paper, we explore the viability of a processing-based explanation
of syntactic ergativity. Much as has been proposed for various island phenonemona
(Kluender 1998, Kluender 2004), the extraction of ergative arguments may simply
be more taxing on the parser than corresponding absolutive extraction. If this is
true, following Hawkins (2004, 2014), syntactically ergative languages could then
be taken to differ from their morphologically ergative counterparts in their tolerance
for difficult structure, eliminating the less efficient, more difficult ergative extraction.
To test this account, we explore the processing of relative clauses in Niuean,
a morphologically, but not syntactically, ergative language. Niuean is an ideal test
case, given that it is closely related to the syntactically ergative Tongan, and thus
might be expected to show an obvious bias against ergative extraction (a bias that
Tongan turns into a categorical restriction). We present novel experimental data
showing that ergative subject gaps in Niuean RCs do not impose any additional
processing difficulty as compared to the processing of absolutive object gaps, thus
calling into question the viability of the processing account in this domain.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002589/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002589<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of AFLA</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>niuean, processing, ergativity, syntactic ergativity, subject preference, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002589/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1362 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002589">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002589">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
