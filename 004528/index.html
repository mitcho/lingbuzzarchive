Hungarian is especially interesting in this respect since it has both rich agreement morphology and a variety of reflexive anaphors. The paper argues that the primary reflexive anaphor and the reciprocal anaphor do not occur in syntactic positions construed with agreement, but complex reflexives trigger trivial 3SG agreement. This is surprising because even the primary reflexive has a possessive structure. It is argued that the primary reflexive has a phi- defective stem and is smaller than a DP, whereas the complex reflexives surveyed here are not defective in this respect and they have a DP shell. This accounts for the observed differences in their distribution.
