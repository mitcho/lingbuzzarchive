I propose a unified account, considering the interfaces between phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax. Specifically, I challenge the toneless view of Mandarin NTs and argue that NTs are not something special but can be analyzed as unstressed mono-moraic tones. Mandarin NTs are classified into three types, based on their morpho-syntactic distributions and tonal operations. Type 1 NTs are underlyingly Lr, L, including affixes and reduplication. Type 2 NTs are clitics as grammatical markers, with high-low tone distinction. Type 3 NTs are de-stressed with L-insertion and involve morphologically reduced words, most of which are function words, compounds, and monomorphemic words. NTs are intimately associated with degrees of grammaticalization. Furthermore, I highlight the asymmetric nature of the phonological processes, with Type 3 processed later than Types 1 and 2. The analysis contributes to the potential existence of grammatical tones (GTs) and the unification of Mandarin T3 sandhi and NT-sandhi, where both are the low-tone sandhi triggered by the Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP). Overall, the paper offers a novel perspective on Mandarin NTs and addresses the puzzling status of NTs, along with their interaction with several phonological issues in Chinese languages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008476/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008476<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under revision</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>neutral tone (nt), unstressed tone, obligatory contour principle (ocp), grammatical tone (gt), grammaticalization, stress, tone sandhi, morphology, phonology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/008476/v2.pdf">v2 [October 2024]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/008476/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2024]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>486 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008476">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008476">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
