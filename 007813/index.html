I make the novel observation that we must distinguish at least three kinds of LDA patterns in the language: (i) LDA into complements of verbs like 'kocicihtun ‘know’ (which I call "epistemic complements"), which is generally free (subject only to Ā locality), but is restricted to an Ā-moving DP under long-distance Ā extraction; (ii) LDA into direct perception complements, which is always free, even when long-distance Ā-extracting a DP; and (iii) LDA into complements of verbs like 'pawatomon ‘want’ (which we can call "subordinative complements", as they feature verbs inflected in the subordinative verbal paradigm), which is always subject to A locality, even when long-distance Ā-extracting a DP. I propose that these three patterns arise from independently-diagnosable differences in clause size: epistemic complements are full, phasal CPs, direct perception complements are reduced, nonphasal CPs, and subordinative complements are (nonphasal) bare TPs.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007813/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007813<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>long-distance agreement, clause typing, a bar movement, passamaquoddy. algonquian, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>21 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007813">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007813">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
