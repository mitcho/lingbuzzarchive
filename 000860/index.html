I propose a Strong Modularity Hypothesis for Discourse Features, according to which no discourse-notion can be encoded by formal features. In contrast to cartographic approaches, only truth-conditional notions may constitute formal features active in the CS. Movements corresponding to non-truth-conditional notions, such as notions of information structure, must thus be interface phenomena, rather than driven by a feature-checking mechanism. To test this hypothesis, the paper investigates (a) the so-called contrastive "Focus movement", well-known from Hungarian, involving exhaustive identification, and (b) a distinct class of widely attested contrast-related movements  contrastive topic and contrastive focus movements  that involve a closed set whose members are explicit in the context, and have no entailment of exhaustivity. The distinct types of discourse-related, and in particular contrast-related, movements analyzed are argued to be due, respectively, to (a) an independent quantificational operator of the CS, such as the truth-conditional maximality operator motivated for Hungarian, or (b) interface effects, such as accommodation of nuclear stress assignment or facilitation of the mapping of syntactic representations to information structure.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000860/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000860<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Lingua special volume</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>contrast, modularity hypothesis, formal features, feature-driven movement, information structure, focus movements, a-bar movement, contrastive focus, contrastive topic, exhaustive identification, pf-interface effects, syntax-information structure mapping, hungarian, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1001 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000860">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000860">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
