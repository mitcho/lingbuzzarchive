Specifically, we investigate what kind of phrases allow preposition drop in Russian spoken in Highland Daghestan and aim at understanding the rationale for this phenomenon. 

Design/Methodology/Approach: We conduct a quantitative analysis of data extracted from the Corpus of Russian spoken in Daghestan, which includes interviews with 53 native speakers of 15 Daghestanian and Turkic languages, amounting to 228 thousand tokens.

Data and Analysis: Data from forty-seven (29 male; 18 female) L2 Russian speakers who produced a sufficient number of prepositional phrases (PPs) were included in the analysis. 50 PPs were collected from each speaker resulting in a dataset of 2350 PPs. Each PP was annotated for preposition drop and several sociolinguistic and linguistic parameters. We fitted a logistic mixed-effects regression model to determine which parameters are significant predictors for preposition drop.

Findings/Conclusions. We show that the probability of preposition drop depends on preposition type, phonetic context and the speakerâ€™s fluency in Russian. We propose that the prominence of preposition drop in the speech of Daghestanian highlanders results from an interplay of two factors: a typological tendency for certain spatial and temporal locations to be formally unmarked and incomplete acquisition of the Russian prepositional system. 

Originality: This is the first detailed quantitative study of preposition drop, based on an inferential statistical analysis of data from a large number of L2 Russian speakers from Daghestan. 

Significance/Implications: The results show that the apparently contact-induced phenomena like preposition drop may be explained both by typological tendencies and incomplete acquisition of L2. This paper is thus important both for the typological study of this phenomenon and for L2 acquisition research.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005772/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005772<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>International Journal of Bilingualism</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>prepositions, preposition drop, language contact, second language acquisition, typology, russian, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>427 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005772">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005772">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
