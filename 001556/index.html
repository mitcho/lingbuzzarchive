Overwhelmingly, these formal analyses fail to address the fact — often noted in the typological literature — that while many languages are consistently accusative, very few appear to be consistently ergative; rather, ergative systems are characterized by "splits". This paper surveys the existing empirical and theoretical work on split ergativity and proposes that split ergativity is epiphenomenal, and that the factors which trigger the appearance of splits are not limited to ergative systems in the first place.

In both aspectual and NP-type splits, we argue, the split is the result of a bifurcation of the clause into two distinct case/agreement domains; this bifurcation results in the subject being, in structural terms, an intransitive subject. Since intransitive subjects do not appear with ergative marking, this straightforwardly accounts for the absence of ergative morphology in the "split". The same factors exist in accusative-patterning systems, but the fact that both transitive and intransitive subjects pattern alike (i.e., as nominatives) obscures the "split", in this case. The proposed analysis is independent of any specific theory of how case assignment is determined, and casts doubt on the need for a third, "split" type of alignment system along side purely accusative and purely ergative, at least as far as the underlying syntax is concerned.
