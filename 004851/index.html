of a processing preference for nested as compared to crossing dependencies
(Kuno and Robinson 1972; Steedman 1985). We propose that restrictions on the A'-
movement of the ergative subject arise because such movement would cross the prior
A-movement path of the absolutive object creating an illicit crossed dependency. In
contrast, the A'-movement of an argument whose merge position is lower than that
of the absolutive object creates a licit nested dependency, as in the A'-movement of
accusative objects in nominative-accusative languages. Our account further develops
the ‘standard theory’ of syntactic ergativity (terminology from Deal 2016 for accounts
based on absolutive inversion, e.g. Bittner and Hale 1996; Aldridge 2004; Coon et
al. 2015, Coon et al. 2019) by strengthening its empirical foundation with insights
from sentence processing and by increasing its empirical coverage within the Mayan
language family and beyond. We correctly predict that i) no argument merged between the A-movement tails of the absolutive DP may be extracted, while
at the same time ii) arguments merged either below or above the A-movement tails are
able to undergo extraction. In addition, the proposed restriction on crossing dependencies accounts for related and unrelated cross-linguistic phenomena, such as syntactic ergativity and word order in Tongic Polynesian, as well as an asymmetry in the wh-questions
derived from double object passives in a number of nominative-accusative languages
