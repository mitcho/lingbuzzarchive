Deriving Parallel Meaning Dimensions from Architectural Considerations</a></b></font><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004818">Andrés Saab</a><br/>June 2020</center>&nbsp;<p></p>The main claim of this chapter is that certain non-truth conditional meanings are exclusively triggered by properties of vocabulary items (in the sense of Halle & Marantz 1993 and subsequent work). In other words, those meanings arise “late” and are not part of the syntactic-semantic derivation. Thus, we capture the notion of parallel meaning dimension from architectural considerations without the need for any metalogic operator (e.g., the symbol ●  in Potts 2005 and McCready 2010, among others) especially designated to separate meaning dimensions. This proposal finds interesting support from certain interactions involving biased words and ellipsis. Our basic expressive paradigm involves pairs of mixed words whose contribution to truth-conditional meaning is equivalent: They are only differentiated by register (e.g., comer ‘to eat’ vs. morfar ‘to eat.inf’) or by register plus a derogative dimension (e.g., slurs: boliviano ‘Bolivians’ vs. bolita ‘Bolivians(pejorative)’). I also propose to model the bias of slur words as stereotypes, understood here as kinds of Kratzerian modal bases, i.e., set of propositions that constitute vague and misinformed theories of particular human groups which are the target of derogation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004818/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004818<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>First Draft</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>expressivity, ellipsis, slurs, register, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004818/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>633 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004818">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004818">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
