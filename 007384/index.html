It concentrates on the analysis of specificatinonal copular clauses (The murderer is John) and clefts (It is John who murdered the butler). Cross-linguistically, these structures are frequently based on the language-specific form of the copula and they are used to express focus, in English focus on the post-copular phrase. Despite a larger body of work on these individual structures, the question of the fundamental relation of information-structure and predication has not been addressed much explicitly from a cross-linguistic perspective. This habilitation thesis addresses this question. 

The main hypothesis is that the assymmetric subject-predicate relationship provided in the syntax and semantics of predication is exploited in languages to establish an asymmetric relation of focus and background. In order to formalize and spell-out this relationship, a model of syntax-information-structure interaction is developed that allows the interface to enrich syntactic constituents with feature bundles during the derivation. On the basis of this model, the syntax and information-structure of specificaitonal copular clauses and clefts are analysed and new corpus data as well as experimental data is considered and included for the analysis. The main claims are: (i) Specificational copular clauses are focus structures; as a a result they are inversion structures in English and German (and other languages). (ii) It-clefts in Englisch and German are also specificational copular clause, with the difference that the underlying syntactic predicate consists of a light-headed relative clause, which is split during the derivation. (iii) Focus in it-clefts expresses the assertion of the origional proposition plus the exclusion of one relevant focus alternative, which focus alternative is excluded depends on the implicit set of alternatives established in the context. (iv) The interpretation of it-clefts is exhaustive, based on the definiteness of the cleft-clause. The exhaustive interpretation, however, depends on the implicit set of alternatives. As discourse participants are cooperative and can adjust the set of implicit alternatives accordingly, exhastivity seems more flexible on the surface, which is visible in the experimental results as well. (v) The underlying core predication is identical cross-linguistically, however, differences arise based on the syntax of focus.
