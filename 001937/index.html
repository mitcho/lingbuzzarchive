In this study I recast this intuition in terms of the semantic distinction between attitude and non-attitude complements. I argue that the latter establish control by simple predication ("predicative control") but the former establish it by variable binding, where the bound variable is a projected coordinate of the embedded context of evaluation ("logophoric control"). I offer an explicit syntax-semantics analysis of the two types, utilizing the idea that logophoric control structures are constructed as a second tier above predicative control structures. In both, PRO figures as a minimal, featureless pronoun, which functions as a lambda-abstractor upon movement.

The analysis derives the obligatory de se reading of OC PRO as a constructional property of attitude complements without ascribing any inherent feature to PRO (a minimal pronoun). It fares better than the prominent semantic alternatives – the property theory and the indexical shift theory of OC – in various respects, theoretical and typological. Importantly, it is capable of deriving a striking universal asymmetry between OC in attitude and non-attitude contexts: the fact that agreement on the embedded verb blocks the former but not the latter. This is handled by reference to the differential agreement properties of predication and variable binding. Further contrasts between the two types of OC follow, some of which unnoticed before, such as the visibility of implicit controllers and the [±human] value of PRO.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001937/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001937<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Revised; To appear in MIT Press</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>control, minimal pronouns, predication, de se, logophoricity, attitude, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001937/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2013]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3221 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001937">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001937">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
