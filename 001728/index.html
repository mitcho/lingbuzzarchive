It sheds more light on the tenability of the often proclaimed opinion that MP and OT are incompatible frameworks given that the explanatory power of the former mainly resides on the generative device whereas the explanatory power of the latter mainly resides in the filtering device. Papers from various perspectives discuss and compare the two devices in the two frameworks. The volume thus collects a large number of the arguments in favour of more a strictly derivational approach, a more strictly filtering approach, or a more hybrid approach.
