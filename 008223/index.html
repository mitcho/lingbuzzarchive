these mutations under the theories of Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz 1993) and
analyzing their effects using Optimality Theory (Prince & Smolensky 1993/2004). Irish Gaelic
(henceforth Irish), as well as the other Modern Celtic languages, have a variety of initial phonological
mutations which occur in morphosyntactic (and not necessarily phonological) contexts (Fife
2010, Sims-Williams 1998, i.a.). The primary focus of this research is on the mutations that affect
word initial consonants. In this paper I show that these mutations are morphemes whose vocabulary
items are comprised of autosegmental phonological feature bundles (similar to what has been
argued for by Ní Chiosáin 1991, Pyatt 1996, a.o.). These phonological feature bundles are realizations
of various inflectional and possibly derivational morphemes which surface as mutation
when they interact with other segments in their phonological environments. This analysis permits
a simpler system for storing morphemes in the lexicon—one that does not require mutation specifications
to be a property of the words that serve as ‘triggers’ for mutation; nor is there a need to
appeal to syntactic structure to derive mutation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008223/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008223<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings from the 58th Annual Meeting of the Chicago Linguistics Society (CLS 58)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>consonant mutation, distributed morphology, optimality theory, irish, nonconcatenative morphology, morphology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>192 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008223">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008223">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
