Furthermore, we point out that another reformulation of Pair-MERGE as Set-MERGE based on a subspecies of MERGE (i.e., Asymmetric MERGE) of Nakashima (to appear) has a self-contradiction problem. Omune (2018) attempts to reformulate Pair-Merge/MERGE as Set-Merge/MERGE within ZFC. We show that his analysis has both conceptual and empirical problems. On the conceptual side, we point out that head raising under ZFC-based analysis inevitably violates the principle of Determinacy (Chomsky 2019a,b, Chomsky et al. 2019). On the empirical side, we show that the ZFC-based reformulation of Pair-MERGE as Set-MERGE does not explain the observation that a head-raised NEG in English licenses an NPI in its c-commanding domain (Roberts 2010). Given these limitations, we conclude that any reformulation of Pair-MERGE based on ZFC is untenable. Moreover, we demonstrate that Nakashimaâ€™s (to appear) recent attempt to derive adjuncts from a variant of MERGE has a conceptual problem, which can be rephrased as an element in the Workspace (WS) being accessible and inaccessible from Minimal Search at the same time. We conclude that the current minimalist model which adopts the system of MERGE (Chomsky 2019a,b) must assume Pair-MERGE as an independent operation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007405/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007405<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Proceedings of WCCFL 41</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pair-merge, set-merge, determinacy, workspace, adjuncts, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>467 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007405">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007405">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
