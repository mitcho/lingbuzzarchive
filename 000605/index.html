Arguments based on the distribution of the question marker -kah (Fortin (2007)) and the lack of the complementizer yang in wh-questions are presented to show that the sluicing construction with PP remnants in Indonesian is derived by regular wh-movement as in English. Based on this discovery, a new parametric theory of the three-way contrast among English, Indonesian, and French with respect to P-stranding is proposed that draws on independently motivated assumptions concerning the percolation of the [+wh] feature onto the PP and the D-to-P incorporation for the purposes of D-P coalescence. 	The proposed theory adopts the recent idea of interface repair that has been developed in recent research as in Merchant (2001), Lasnik (1999, 2001, 2005), Boeckx and Lasnik (2006), and others. The proposed analysis provides strong evidence that the syntax-external phonological component conducts several domain-specific operations they avail of to legitimatize an otherwise illegitimate syntactic object but only within the range of options that is parametrically set by a particular language.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000605/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000605<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>p-stranding, sluicing, indonesian, interface repair, d-to-p incorporation, feature percolation, phonology, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>282 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000605">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000605">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
