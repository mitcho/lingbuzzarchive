The two arguably most far-reaching goals/arguments of Kiparsky’s paper are (i) to show that there are no opaque interactions in Basque (contrary to our claims in the book) (ii) that the Morphotactics version of DM fails to characterize wordhood. We respond to both of these claims. We observe, more generally, that a common argument against DM is that it is redundant to have a syntax and a postsyntax which partially overlap but are distinct modules. However, when one holds the LM analysis up to the light, it necessarily contains a syntax and a presyntax. As such, progress in the field will arguably come not from a comparison of which framework has ‘fewer’, partially overlapping modules — as both in fact have two — but which specific set of generalizations and proposals lead to a better understanding of the nature and limits of the constraints and repairs that characterize these closely related dialects.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002330/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002330<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in a volume edited by V.
