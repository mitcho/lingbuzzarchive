Previous research has observed that this process, which is commonly referred to as pronominal cliticization, has characteristics of A-movement in Spanish and related languages. However, in this paper we describe and analyze the fact that in the Iberian Spanish of rural Valladolid, such cliticization also has a canonical A-bar property: the licensing of parasitic gaps (PGs). We argue that such cliticization in this particular variety is derived by composite A+A-bar movement, which has traits of both movement types. Spanish also has a clitic doubling construction, in which the expected gap left behind by the clitic’s movement is filled by a co-referent full DP. We show that PG-licensing by clitic doubling fails, and suggest that this phenomenon involves pure A-movement, unlike the composite movement of non-doubled clitics. We also show that PG-licensing by pronominal cliticization behaves precisely as expected in a number of other ways,  focusing on PGs in multiple movement contexts. In Iberian Spanish, both a direct object and an indirect object can be cliticized. We show that the patterns of PG licensing in multiple cliticization contexts mirror those seen in multiple A-bar movement configurations in English explored by previous work, and verify similar predictions about contexts where pronominal cliticization and WH-movement co-occur.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006757/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006757<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>WCCFL 40 proceedings</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>parasitic gaps, pronouns, clitics, a/a-bar distinction, multiple movement, spanish, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>508 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006757">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006757">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
