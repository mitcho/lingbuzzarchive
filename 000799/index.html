The new element is their involvement in branching onsets, a previously unconsidered fact that I submit is critical. This opens the way for a uniformly right-branching analysis of syllabic consonants (Blaho 2001, 2004) 1) in root-internal position regarding the analysis of prefix vocalization, 2) in root-final position where they alternate with non-syllabic liquids, and 3) in the evolution of trapped consonants from Old to Modern Czech.

The right-branching analysis produces two additional benefits: a solution for the problem that left-branching analyses have in the right periphery of syllabic consonants, and an explanation for the fact that trapped consonants cannot bear stress (they are not associated to a nucleus).

The price to pay is a softening of the definition of branching onsets (reintroduction of the debate regarding relative sonority). Also, internal empty nuclei must be granted lateral actorship: they are able to license TR clusters at least in some systems.

The latter take follows Charette (1992) and Cyran (2003). It raises the question of the lateral actorship of internal empty nuclei.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000799/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000799<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of Formal Description of Slavic Languages 7</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonology, syllabic consonants, trapped consonants, licensing scales, branching onsets, muta cum liquida, old czech, czech, polish</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>463 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000799">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000799">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
