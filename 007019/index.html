By analyzing novel evidence from ditransitive and wh-in situ constructions, I argue that the postulation of low focus movement in Brazilian Portuguese faces a number of empirical challenges and that, contrary to the literature, such operation is in fact unavailable in the language; in other words, postverbal focalization and wh-in situ are better analyzed as being truly in situ. As a consequence, I maintain that the clausal structure of Brazilian Portuguese does not include a low focus projection such as Belletti’s (2004) and that Rizzi’s (1997) Focus Criterion is not operative in the language. I finally discuss the consequences of those claims to the analysis of traditional left-peripheral focalization, which I maintain is not due to the need to satisfy the Focus Criterion, but is instead licensed when other semantic and/or pragmatic effects co-occur with focalization.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007019/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007019<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Accepted by Natural Language & Linguistic Theory (NLLT)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>information structure, focalization, focus criterion, ditransitives, wh-questions, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>361 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007019">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007019">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
