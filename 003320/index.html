logically conceivable pattern – ABA under some arrangement of cells – is
unattested. Existing approaches assume that such *ABA generalizations
provide evidence for feature inventories which are restricted to features that
stand in containment relations, and are thus subject to Pāṇinian rule order.
We present a novel approach to *ABA generalizations that derives from
general properties of feature-based morphology. To this end, we develop a
formal account of the widespread view that morphological paradigms derive
from rules that relate abstract features from an inventory to morphological
exponents. We demonstrate that the feature-based view restricts the space
of typological patterns even without any further assumptions. We show furthermore
that the feature-based theory derives *ABA as a special case of a
broader class of generalizations if the number of features in the inventory
must be minimal, and that these generalizations arise under a variety of general
assumptions about feature-algebras (extrinsically ordered or Pāṇinian
and with or without feature intersection). We discuss which explanation
might be correct for actual cases of *ABA constraints, and we explore the
consequences of the feature-based general approach for a range of paradigm
sizes including those with more than three cells.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003320/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003320<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>features, morphology, combinatorics, syncretism, typology, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003320/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2017]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>953 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003320">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003320">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
