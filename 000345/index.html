Credo (I believe) is the subject-less first person present tense verbal form of the epistemic verb credere (to believe). Dicono (they say) is the subject-less third person plural present tense verbal form of the verb dire. 

These verbal forms can be followed by a subordinate clause. However, under certain circumstances  for instance in Complementizer Deletion structures  the (apparently) embedded clause exhibits several properties typical of main clauses, which are incompatible with the syntax of subordinate sentences. Moreover, in these cases, from the semantic point of view, both the main verbal form and the alleged complement clause present some peculiarities, which call for an explanation.

We will argue that the sequence consisting of credo or dicono followed by a complementizer-less clause should often be seen as a mono-clausal structure and that credo (I believe) and dicono (they say) are better treated as heads occupying functional projections, expressing an epistemic and an evidential value respectively. 

The theoretical question we address concerns the architecture of the so-called left periphery with respect to the epistemic and evidential projections in the clause. These projections are deeply connected with the speech event in itself and with the role of the speaker in the conversational situation. In this paper we propose that such a role should be further articulated into the speakers own psychological epistemic state  the epistemic projection  and her evaluation of the source of evidence  the evidential one.

This issue is particularly relevant in that it contributes to clarifying what the representation of the speaker is in the syntactic structure of the sentence.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000345/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000345<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>epistemicity, evidentiality, left-periphery, speaker, first person, subjunctive, adverbs, complementizer deletion, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>216 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000345">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000345">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
