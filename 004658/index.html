It provides a semantico-pragmatic analysis of the ban on wh-subextraction out of DPs with the "strong" articles in Austro-Bavarian and demonstratives in English which assumes their direct referentiality. The ungrammaticality of question formation is proposed to result from the pathological uninformativeness of its possible answers. The ban on wh-subextraction thus emerges as a new testing tool for direct referentiality.

I further propose an analysis of the cases where strong articles and demonstratives do not behave directly referentially. Assuming structural decomposition of strong articles and demonstratives into a determiner head and a relational head, I propose that directly referential interpretation results from a silent individual pronoun occupying the specifier of the relational head, whereas covarying interpretations arise as a result of either a restrictive relative clause occupying this position, or else a relational noun functioning as the relational component itself. I proceed to extend this approach to account for the distribution of strong and weak definite articles in DPs with restrictive relative clauses. A strong-DP is predicted to be used in all contexts where it is taken for granted that there is more than one individual with the nominal property because of the pragmatic pressure to use an LF with a component which triggers an "anti-uniqueness" presupposition. I show the latter to be a required feature of the semantic model for strong articles and demonstratives on independent grounds.

In the second part I analyze the pattern of the free-standing article omission in Swedish. I identify the omission with the use of a covert restrictor-less definite article, which accounts for why it is easily available with context-sensitive modifiers whose semantics has to make reference to a domain restrictor, but is limited to the cases of "global uniqueness" with context-insensitive ones. Thus Swedish, I propose, illustrates the case of a "rudimentary" article which, if the only one available, would make the problem of incomplete descriptions unsurmountable. This conclusion relies on, and thus provides evidence for, the unavailability of either domain restriction at the NP-level or implicit global restriction of the domain of individuals as a means of modelling the behaviour of Swedish definites.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004658/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004658<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>McGill University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>determiners, dp island, scopelessness, domain restriction, definiteness, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>411 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004658">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004658">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
