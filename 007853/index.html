However, there are consistent differences between various types of factive verbs, for instance between the so-called cognitive factives (know, find out, discover) and emotive factives (regret, resent, be sad). The former are generally said to be more permissive and have even been reported to allow adjunct extraction. The current study tests the availability of adjunct extraction in the case of cognitive and emotive factive verbs in English, by means of a comprehension task. The results show that adjunct extraction is indeed banned, with no difference between the two sub-types of factive verbs. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007853/current.docx">docx</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007853<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Studii de lingvistica</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>island effects, weak islands, factive verbs, cognitive factives, emotive factives, adjunct extraction, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>154 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007853">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007853">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
