We survey the various ways in which we report what was said and argue
for a fundamental semantic distinction between two types of speech reporting. In
evidential speech reports, the fact that something was said is not-at-issue, i.e. it is meant to signal that the at-issue content is based on hearsay evidence. Certain evidential markers in languages like Cuzco Quechua, Gitksan, and Cheyenne, as well as some uses of modals (e.g. Dutch moeten (‘must’)) and speech act adverbials (e.g. English allegedly) belong to this class. In eventive speech reports, by contrast, the main contribution is the existence of a speech event with certain properties. Direct, indirect, and free indirect speech reports belong to this class. Moreover, we argue that so-called quotative evidentials are actually eventive, as are parenthetical reports and reportative mood constructions in German and Ancient Greek.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003526/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003526<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>evidentiality, reportative, direct/indirect speech, quotation, gitksan, parentheticals, event semantics, not-at-issue content, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003526/v3.pdf">v3 [October 2018]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003526/v2.pdf">v2 [October 2018]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003526/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2017]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>480 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003526">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003526">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
