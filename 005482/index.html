This article discusses phonetic arbitrariness, i.e. the fact that the relationship between a phonological category and the way it is pronounced (its phonetic exponent) is arbitrary. A cartography of voices which endorse phonetic arbitrariness in one way or another is established: they come from different quarters, cut across theories and reach their conclusion for a variety of reasons. A question pursued is about the settings that enable, enforce or prohibit phonetic arbitrariness. It is argued that phonetic arbitrariness is a necessary consequence of modularity, except if the association of phonological and phonetic categories (spell-out) is made universal and innate. This is the direction taken in the work of Hale-Reiss-Kissock-Volenec. The assessment of this perspective requires discussion of L1 acquisition and learnability issues, which cannot be provided here due to space restrictions. But an argument challenging universal and innate mapping is made in the conclusion: would the equivalent at the upper interface with morpho-syntax be a serious candidate, i.e. if, say, past tense had the exponent  ed in all languages of the world because humans are genetically coded for this association? The alternative to universal and innate mapping is available in much of the literature: phonological categories (features) are emergent, i.e. constructed by the child during L1 acquisition solely on the grounds of environmental data. This perspective has phonetic arbitrariness in-built, since it will phonologize whatever the environment provides for. Finally, it is shown that a fully substance-free approach to phonological primes (features, Elements) is a radical departure from current systems on the conceptual side, but does not change much in the every-day practice of phonologists, who may happily continue to use the familiar substantive vocabulary when talking about sound patterns: these terms are simply shorthand for the true phonological structure where substance is absent and only comes in upon spell-out, just like chemists talk about water when they mean the real chemical object H2O.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005482/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005482<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td> Phonological Studies (Japan) 22: 105-118</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>substance-free primes, features, elements, emergent features, phonetics-phonology mapping, arbitrariness, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>368 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005482">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005482">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
