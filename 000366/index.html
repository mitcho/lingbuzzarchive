Our main objective is to argue that the proper treatment of Basque verbal morphology must take into account both syntactic and postsyntactic (PF) principles and rules, as delineated in the framework of Distributed

Morphology.<p>



The general theoretical proposals we advance are the following: <br>

(1) a. The finite auxiliary is a complex that contains ergative, dative, and absolutive clitics. <br>

b. What is normally referred to as the root of the auxiliary is actually a T head that agrees with the absolutive argument in the clause. <br>

c. Basque has no third person absolutive clitics.<p>



We show that an analysis along these lines has a number of positive consequences. First, it renders a syntactic Person Case Constraint (PCC) account of Basque clitic combinations otiose. In other

words, contrary to what has been written, Basque does not have a bona fide PCC that disallows the syntactic combination of third person datives and first/second person accusatives. Rather, the apparent Basque PCC falls out from the fact that Basque has only one clitic position for internal arguments, and from the fact that Basque simply has no third person absolutive clitics.



Second, our analysis paves the way for an explanation of ergative displacement as the result of metathesis (cf. Harris and Halle (2005)), which turns out to provide an economical and explanatory account of ergative doubling with the same machinery. Third, our proposal explains

root allomorphy, i.e. the distribution of root morphemes in the auxiliary, in terms of well-known restrictions on the locality of agreement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000366/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000366<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In Roberta D'Alessandro, Susann Fischer and Gunnar Hrafn Hrafnbjargarson (eds.)
