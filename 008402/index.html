The core proposal is that there are two necessary conditions, which, together, are also sufficient, for a question to be understood as rhetorical: (i) the question must be presupposed to be closed in the input context, i.e., the input context must be assumed to be maximally informative relative to it; (ii) the speakerâ€™s publicly recognized goal in performing the speech act must be to trigger a mandatory conversational implicature that connects the question to the previous context. In establishing the first condition, I argue against the widely held assumption that in order for a question to be rhetorical, the common ground of the input context must contain its answer. The argument is based on the existence of unresolvable rhetorical questions, noted in Rohde (2006). In establishing the second condition, I argue that the answer to a rhetorical question, in case there is one, need not be assertable in its input context, pace Biezma and Rawlins (2017), and propose an explanation for when such an answer is assertable and when it is not. The approach developed below, I argue, allows us to capture the status of rhetorical questions both relative to ordinary assertions and questions, and relative to other non-canonical questions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008402/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008402<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Proceedings of CLS 60</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>questions, rhetorical questions, non-canonical questions, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>233 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008402">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008402">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
