their grammatical properties (e.g., Borillo, 2000). Though details vary across
proposals, an influential view on their taxonomy can be synthesised as follows.
Simple prepositions act as heads directly governing the NP that introduces the
landmark object, or ground (e.g., à, devant: Talmy, 2000: ch. 1). Complex
prepositions may include Internal Location Nouns (ILN’s). These nouns specify
which location the located entity or figure occupies, given a ground (e.g.,
l’intérieur in à l’intérieur de: Borillo, 1988; Aurnague, 1998). These two
morphological types act as poles in a cline of increasing complexity. While à
and devant can govern a ground NP, devant is a bi-syllabic preposition that
originated in the conflation of de and avant (e.g., Fagard & Sarda, 2009).
Prepositions such as près de and à l’intérieur de include two, and four
morphemes, and may qualify as (increasingly) complex prepositions.
Recent semantic works have capitalised on this rich morpho-syntactic
research and proposed the Semantic Cartography hypothesis (Aurnague &
Vieu, 2013, 2015). This hypothesis suggests that a cluster of morphologically
simple prepositions (e.g., à) cover functional relations among figure and
ground. Increasingly complex prepositions can instead introduce reference
to internal and external regions, mostly via ILN’s (e.g., à l’intérieur de vs. à
l’extérieur de). The relation(s) between figure and ground is thus mediated
via a third entity: a region that the figure can occupy. The Semantic
Cartography hypothesis thus suggests that morphological and semantic
types are related, though not necessarily in an isomorphic manner. The goal of this chapter is to confirm the Extended Semantic Cartography (ESC) hypothesis for Italian, Chinese and Korean. We choose these languages because they include different sets of categories related to prepositions and ILN’s (cf. Hagège, 2010). We show that the ESC hypothesis can be derived from a compositional analysis of the senses assigned to spatial categories and their constituting parts.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007631/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007631<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Les prépositions complexes en français: Théories, descriptions, applications.
