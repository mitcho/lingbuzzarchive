In earlier models of the architecture of grammar, the former is carried out by cyclic derivation or by levels in Lexical Phonology; under current theories it is achieved through strata in Stratal Optimality Theory or phases. In the representational approach, phonologically relevant chunks are expressed as juncture phonemes in structuralism, as hash marks (#) in SPE, and, since the early 1980s, as prosodic constituency (Prosodic Word etc.) 
Since SPE, both ways of defining chunks have been considered to be compatible, and since the development of Prosodic Phonology in the early 1980s, the division of labor has been roughly defined by word size: cycles determine domains below the word level, while prosodic constituents delineate domains of word size or larger. That is, roughly, Lexical Phonology can handle strings of morphemes but cannot identify larger units because postlexical phonology is non-cyclic. Strings of words are therefore structured by prosodic constituency. 
If phase theory is on the right track, this division of labor must be wrong: the very essence of phase theory is to define items that are bigger than the word, and to send them to PF (and LF). Against this backdrop, our first goal is to show that there can only be one chunk-defining device: theory cannot afford to have the same work done twice. 
The second goal of the paper follows on from this idea. As it stands, phase theory is unable to describe all phonologically relevant chunks, as these are too small and too diverse to be delineated in the current working. In order to qualify as the only chunk-defining device in grammar, phase theory needs to be made more flexible: in other words, it needs to be adapted to the demands of phonology.
We refer to this modified version of phase theory as Modular PIC as it allows for the PIC to produce an effect in one module, but not in another.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001993/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001993<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001993">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001993</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>draft</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax-pf mapping, phase impenetrability condition, spell-out, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>621 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001993">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001993">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
