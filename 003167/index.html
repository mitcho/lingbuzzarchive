Production data of LD wh-movement have been elicited from 97 adult Mongolian speakers in Ulaanbaatar. The participants were at the age between 19 and 23 (female = 94, male = 3, mean age = 20), who were classified into advanced and developing groups. While LD wh-movement was infrequently observed, wh-scope marking predominantly emerged, possibly because it dispenses with Internal Merge of the wh-phrase pied-piping Q across the clausal boundary. On the other hand, the developing group depended more on silent-scope marking, possibly because the wh-expletive might not have been available in their lexicon. Moreover, the advanced group initially displaced the least possible elements containing the wh-phrase when attempting to derive LD wh-movement, while the developing group could not even displace any elements but spelled-out the wh-phrase in situ. Overall, economy conditions in language acquisition turns out to govern the Mongolian-English interlanguage; hence, more economical derivations emerge at the onset as long as they are admissible, not necessarily grammatical. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003167/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003167<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>not submitted, as of October, 2016</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>l2 acquisition, long-distance (ld) wh-movement, wh-copying, wh-scope marking, silent-scope marking, wh-expletive, q-morpheme, mongolian, interlanguage, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>234 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003167">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003167">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
