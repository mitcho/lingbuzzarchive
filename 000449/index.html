Core arguments in Basque typically surface in one of two case forms: ergative and absolutive. Absolutive has been identified as a special instance of nominative case by many linguists (Bittner & Hale, 1996; Woolford, 2006; Legate, 2006), while Holmer (1999) argues that it is actually accusative case. Opinions on ergative case are more split, with some (Bittner & Hale, 1996; Holmer, 1999; Fernaandez & Albizu, 2000) arguing that ergative case is assigned by I<sup>0</sup>, either under Government or Agree, and others (Legate, 2006; Woolford, 2006; Spring, 2000) arguing that ergative is inherent case assigned by v<sup>0</sup> to its specifier.</p>

<p>In the process of examining the claims above, I will conclude that absolutive is nominative and ergative is inherent. However, I will also provide conceptual and empirical arguments that nominative and inherent are misunderstood notions that require a considerable amount of reanalysis themselves. The primary motivation for this is the proposed elimination of the [CASE]-feature, whose status as an element in Minimalism is problematic.</p>

<p>The thesis is divided into five chapters. The first chapter introduces a basic vocabulary for discussing argument roles and outlines some descriptive data about case marking in Basque. In chapter 2 I summarize two earlier approaches to the problem (Bittner & Hale (1996) and Holmer (1999)), both within the Government and Binding framework of Chomsky (1981, 1982). In chapter 3 I outline the main elements of the framework that I have adopted for this thesis, including the radical claim that nominative case is an uninterpretable [TENSE] feature on D<sup>0</sup>, rather than a sui generis [CASE]-feature. In chapter 4 I argue that absolutive can only be nominative case (uT on D<sup>0</sup>), while ergative case is assigned by a totally different mechanism (inherent case assignment) and is not mutually exclusive with absolutive case. I also argue that the theory as it currently stands cannot provide a mechanism for inherent case assignment without considerable conceptual and empirical costs. Finally, in my conclusion I discuss the importance of empirical coverage compared to conceptual coherency and reiterate the importance of eliminating [CASE]-features from Minimalism, then I speculate about the relevance of my findings to a general typology of ergativity.</p><table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000449/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000449<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Portland, Oregon: Reed College</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>basque, ergativity, ut, case, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>909 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000449">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000449">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
