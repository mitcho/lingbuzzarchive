Linear strings with the surface order V-Adv-Aux are argued to have one of two underlying hierarchical structures. Either they have the structure [[XP[V]-X]-Aux], where the apparent adverb is actually a projecting head, or they have the structure [[VPO-V]-[XP X-[Aux-tVP]]], where a head-final VP has raised over two inflectional heads. The apparent impossibility of *[[VPV-Adv]-Aux] appears to suggest that adverbs also count as ‘interveners’ for FOFC, so that the generalisation might actually be more general than previously thought. It is proposed, though, that the ban on *[[VP V-Adv]-Aux actually follows from existing accounts of FOFC in conjunction with the independent ban on *[[O V]-Adv] noted by Ernst (2003, 2004). The derivation of V-O-Adv order is also discussed as it appears prima facie to be derived  a FOFC-violation. Evidence suggests, however, that in instances of V-O-Adv, the verb and object move past the adverb separately rather than as a phrase, meaning that such orders fall outside the constraint. This kind of derivation is unavailable with V-O-Aux because of Travis’ Head Movement Constraint, which blocks head-movement of V past Aux.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001473/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001473<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001473">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001473</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Book chapter to appear in Biberauer, Holmberg, Roberts & Sheehan (in progress) The Final over Final Constraint: A word-order universal and its implications for linguistic theory.
