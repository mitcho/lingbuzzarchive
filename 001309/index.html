This dissertation looks at what happens when moved material “projects” and it does this using a theory of constituent structure without phrasal projection (cf. Brody's mirror theory). More precisely the question then is: what happens when material that is not in the deepest position of a chain heads a structure? /// The rejection of Chomsky's “target projects” condition means that here extended projections are not made up of functional categories taken from the lexicon. Instead, the (empty) heads in an extended projection are “derived heads” whose category can be calculated from the properties of their complement and specifier. /// This proposal has implications for the analysis of complementizer optionality in the context of verb movement and adjunction structures (Chapter 2), the difference between verb-initial and verb-second languages (Chapter 3), and free relatives, which involve the “projection” of a moved wh-phrase (Chapter 4). /// The dissertation also introduces a new set-based system of structure representation. This system is more restrictive than tree-based alternatives and provides the basis for an analysis of verb-second that does not stipulate EPP-features to derive “filled specifier” effects.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001309/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001309<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>UCL, University of London</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>head movement, complementizer, verb-initial, verb-second, free relatives, adjunction, projection, extended projection, dominance, tree structure, functional categories, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3117 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001309">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001309">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
