In this paper, I propose that case assignment and overt voice alternations in these languages are different reflexes of the same interaction between the lexical features of Voice and the distribution of valued phi-features in the syntax. The result is an expanded system of Voice, varying along two dimensions: (i) external argument introduction, which is lexically specified on Voice, and (ii) the presence of a valued phi-feature, which is derived on Voice through feature sharing with lower verbal functional heads. The analysis presented for simple transitives in Austronesian-type voice languages is extended to account for productive causatives in Austronesian, which are proposed to involve Voice over Voice, as well as voice morphology in nominative-accusative languages such as Japanese.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003750/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003750<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>voice, transitivity, ergativity, austronesian, case, argument structure, causative, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>637 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003750">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003750">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
