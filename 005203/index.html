Martí’s account hypothesizes that the number marking we see on nouns in this construction is the result of the interaction between the compositional semantics of number features, as conceived of in Harbour (2014), and of cardinal numerals, as conceived of in Scontras (2014) and others. Extending Martí’s account to singular-dual-plural languages makes concrete predictions about the types of number marking we should observe on their nouns when they combine with numerals, and the question that arises is whether these are the patterns that we indeed find cross-linguistically. I argue below that the numeral+noun construction in Yimas and Hopi conforms straightforwardly to these predictions. I also discuss Imere and Ljubljana Slovenian, languages which can be shown to conform to the predictions once a proper understanding of complex numerals (in the case of Ljubljana Slovenian) and number prefixes (in the case of Imere) is in place. The consideration of Ljubljana Slovenian requires an analysis for complex numerals, aspects of which I borrow from Ionin and Matushansky (2006, 2018) and adapt to fit Martí’s proposal. The analysis makes additional predictions that remain to be investigated and that are spelled out as well. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005203/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005203<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Catalan Journal of Linguistics, 19, 159-198</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dual, number features, numerals, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>442 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005203">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005203">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
