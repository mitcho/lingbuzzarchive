biological consequences of being a mechanism with a single source of

energy.    A careful look at the representations needed show that each

mental module has a separate form of  representation.   And therefore

interfaces require careful matching.     Merge and labeling describes

a hierarchy in language but perhaps not other mental hierarchies.  It is distinct from Concatenation, which  may be a broader mental capacity; Language calls for  recursive Merge and Label  hierarchies.

      We argue that âfrequencyâ is not a meaningful concept in psychology

without a representation whose frequency is being tabulated.   Therefore  every  model of  change must work with representations.   However it is possible for  representations that are not perfectly captured by grammar to be identified.  For instance, the notion of leftward focal stress can apply at the word, phrase, or morphological level at first before being liniked to sepate modules in the mature grammar.   Lebeauxâs notion of Adjoin-Alpha as an acquisition primitive is thereby  supported.  In sum, it is possible that frequency-linked representations, still connected to an innate UG, play a role in acquisition.  We conclude with an analysis of gradual âed acquisition that re-introduces a role for LAD.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001008/current.doc">doc</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001008<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Lingua (to appear) K.
