We found that children tended to associate focus operators zhiyou "only" and shi "be" with the verb phrase (VP), whereas adults uniquely associated them with the subject noun phrase (NP). To account for this difference, we propose that children initially treat focus operators as adverbials, thus ending up associating with the VP. In order to assess our proposal, we examined children's understanding of zhiyou-constructions with negation like Zhiyou Yuehan meiyou chi pingguo "Only John didn't eat an apple". It was found that  children, like adults, consistently associated the focus operator with the subject NP in this construction. The findings have an important bearing on language learnability, since negation assists children in reaching the adult interpretation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000891/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000891<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To Appear, Journal of Child Language</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>focus operator, child mandarin, negation, vp-oriented, adverbial, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>626 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000891">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000891">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
