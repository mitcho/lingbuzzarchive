Specifically, I suggest that first Merge as well as internal Merge can target subconstituents of structures already built by Merge. This creates structures which I call Banyan trees, in which there is more than one undominated node. I suggest that this model, together with certain assumptions about phases and about the functional sequence of syntactic heads derive important facts about the structure of idioms.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000191/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000191<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Variation Yearbook 5: 227-263</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>idioms, merge, phrase structure, banyan tree, discontinuous constituents, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1967 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000191">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000191">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
