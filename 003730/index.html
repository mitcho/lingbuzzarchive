Brazilian Portuguese (DBP): double object constructions and the ethical dative. Double object
constructions (DOC) consist in the form [V NP NP], generally with verbs that denote (transfer
of) possession or movement. The ethical dative consists in a non-argument 1st or 2nd person
dative clitic that is interpreted as in an indirect relation with the event.
The work begins with a review of literature on DOCs in BP, namely Scher (1996), Salles (1997),
Torres Morais & Salles (2010), Moretti (2010) and Armelin (2011). No consensus is found in
this bulk of research – even regarding the definition of DOC or dative shift.
After presenting the theoretical frameworks assumed in the present thesis – namely the
Minimalist Program (MP), the interface between syntax and lexical semantics, and Distributed
Morphology (DM) – we present a review of literature on the category Applicative, its definition
and properties, namely Bresnan & Mchombo (1990), Pylkkänen (2002, 2008), McGinnis (2001,
2004, 2008), Jeong (2006) and Wood (2014, 2015).
Going further, we suggest that the constructions found in DBP can be accounted for as low
applicative constructions, as proposed by Pylkkänen (op. cit.). Additionally, we relate the
alternation between [V IO DO] and [V DO IO] to discursive factors, based on research on
cartography/left periphery and informational structure.
We then presented an account of clitic datives, focusing on the ethical dative. Based on
Pylkkänen's applicative tests and informational/discursive properties, we suggest that ethical
datives can be analyzed as high applicative constructions, as proposed by Pylkkänen (op. cit.).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003730/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003730<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>faculdade de letras - universidade federal de minas gerais</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>formal syntax, argument structure, applicatives, double object construction, datives, ethical dative, dative shift, brazlian portuguese, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>466 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003730">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003730">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
