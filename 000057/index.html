Consonant Gradation is illustrated in (1).

<p>

(1) a. guolli 'fish' nominative

b. guoli 'fish' accusative

</p>

Historically, the alternation was phonologically conditioned (see Sammallahti 1998 for details), but in the modern language, it is morphologized, so that it occurs without any phonologically overt trigger. The form used in the nominative singular (for this class of nouns) is known as the Strong Grade, and the form used in the accusative is known as the Weak Grade.

<p>

Northern Sámi has a three-way length contrast in consonants, so that alternations like that in (2) are also found.

</p>

(2) a. gol:li 'gold' nominative

b. golli 'gold' accusative

<p>

The extra-long consonant center in (2a) is known as Quantity 3 (Q3), while the geminates seen in (2b)  and (1a) are known as Quantity 2 (Q2), and short consonant centers like that in (1b) are known as Quantity 1 (Q1).

</p>

The general pattern is the one already illustrated:

<p>

(3) a. Strong Grade Q2 --- Weak Grade Q1

b. Strong Grade Q3 --- Weak Grade Q2

<p>

Grade constrasts are not always a simple matter of consonant length; the alternations may surface as preaspiration (of stops), preglottalization (of nasals), schwa epenthesis (in heterorganic clusters), and various other manifestations. Furthermore, phonological processes may conspire to obscure the quantity contrast (see Bye 2001). In particular, lengthening processes give rise to Q2---Q2 alternations (where there is no length contrast, but a different phonological manifestation of gradation), Q3---Q1 alternations, and even Q2---Q3 alternations, where the Weak Grade is phonologically longer than the Strong Grade.

<p>

In this paper, I discuss the system of Consonant Gradation and its significance for our understanding of morphological paradigms. Consonant Gradation pervades the morphological system of Northern Sámi; it is an important part of the verbal, nominal, and adjectival inflectional systems, as well as interacting with morphological derivation. It affects not only roots, but also derivational suffixes and even some inflectional suffixes. It is phonologically complex, but systematic, affecting even recent loan words. 

<p>

Because of the productivity of Consonant Gradation, the system that generates paradigms must be able to effectuate Consonant Gradation; the root alternations in Northern Sámi are not learned by rote, and Bals (2002) has shown that children learn to correctly use the Consonant Gradation process before the age of three (in fact, the phonologically simplest alternation is already being correctly used by the age of two).

<p>

I propose that Consonant Gradation be analyzed as an autosegmental morphological process; I consistently represent the Strong Grade as an infixal timing slot, attached to certain suffixes in the inflectional paradigms but also to certain derivational suffixes. The result is an elegant and simple morphology, with the complicated surface pattern being due to the details of how the phonological system handles the extra timing slot.</p><table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000057/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000057<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000057">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000057</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>2008 in The Bases of Inflectional Identity, edited by Asaf Bachrach and Andrew Nevins, pp. 73-100.
