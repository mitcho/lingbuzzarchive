One of these local models, dubbed Pursuit, uses an associative learning mechanism to estimate word-referent probability but pursues and tests the best referent-meaning at any given time. Pursuit is found to perform as well as global models under many conditions extracted from naturalistic corpora of parent child-interactions, even though the model maintains far less information than global models. Moreover, Pursuit is found to best capture human experimental findings from several relevant cross-situational word learning experiments, including those of Yu and Smith (2007), the paradigm example of a finding believed to support fully global cross-situational models. Implications and limitations of these results are discussed, most notably that the model characterizes only the earliest stages of word learning, when reliance on the co-occurring referent world is at its greatest.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003012/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003012<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Cognitive Science</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language acquisition, word learning, computational modeling, morphology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003012/v2.pdf">v2 [June 2016]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003012/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1236 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003012">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003012">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
