A natural question arising here is its potential relationship with the lack of Subject Condition in Japanese. In this paper, we will show under the Minimalist Program that this hypothesis correctly accounts for transparency of subjects. In so doing, we will explore some consequences of simplest Merge (i.e. Merge (α, β) => {α, β}) advocated by Epstein, Kitahara, and Seely (EKS 2012, 2013) and φ-defectiveness in Japanese (i.e. the absence of φ-feature agreement/C-T inheritance) defended by Saito (2011). More specifically, three cross-linguistic generalizations can be deduced naturally from these two general assumptions: (i) subjects are opaque for extraction in English whereas transparent in Japanese (Lasnik and Saito 1992), (ii) the Comp-Trace effect does not exist in Japanese, as opposed to English (Ishii 2004), and (iii) adjuncts, unlike subjects, are basically opaque for extraction universally (Stepanov 2007). From the theoretically perspective, our idea is minimalist in nature in that no ad hoc language/construction-specific mechanisms are stipulated to capture both principled and parametric aspects of syntax.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002334/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002334<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002334">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002334</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the 10th Workshop on Altaic Formal Linguistics (WAFL 10)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>merge, φ-feature agreement, subject condition, comp-trace effect, japanese, turkish, mongolian, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1339 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002334">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002334">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
