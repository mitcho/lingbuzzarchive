Our results show that subject islands vary in strength depending on the type of the predicate, with unaccusative subjects being the weakest islands because of their initial status as internal arguments. This in turn validates the idea that extraction is sensitive to the base position of the constituent from which it moved. This is particularly evident in Russian, where subextraction out of unaccusative subjects and postverbal objects is equally acceptable. In English, however, unaccusative subjects are less transparent than objects; we attribute this difference to the fact that English speakers have to deal with the tension between the permissible extraction out of a base position and the impossible extraction out of an external subject. This tension can also explain disparities in the acceptability of unaccusative subject islands reported in the literature. Taken together, our results allow us to compare two types of explanations for island effects, CED-based accounts on the one hand, and freezing accounts on the other. Our results are consistent with CED accounts, and underscore the importance of derivational history in extractions; the extraction out of an unaccusative subject is sensitive to the base position of that constituent. Furthermore, the finding that Russian scrambled objects, which are arguably in an adjoined position, are also strong islands, further supports CED-type accounts.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001619/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001619<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>subject islands, ced, freezing, english, russian, processing, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>753 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001619">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001619">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
