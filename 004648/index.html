The analysis implies that phi-agreement between binders and bindees results from a syntactic dependency that applies at the derivation to LF, and not through a separate PF operation. It makes use of the special binding mechanism proposed originally in Kratzer 1991 to encode focus dependencies more generally ("Tanglewood" sentences). The new data, from English and Hebrew, shows that fake indexicals in relative clauses without "only" are sensitive to the presence of contrastive focus, which poses a challenge to current "minimal pronoun" approaches to pronominal binding (Kratzer 2009, Wurmbrand 2017). The cross-linguistic variation in this domain is also briefly discussed.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004648/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004648<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of NELS 49 </td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>fake indexicals, binding, pronouns, phi-features, agreement, minimal pronouns, focus, alternatives, tanglewood, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004648/v2.pdf">v2 [June 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004648/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>277 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004648">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004648">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
