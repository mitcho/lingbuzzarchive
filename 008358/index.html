A common argument for this concept comes from the observation that AL is obviated when visible material such as a high adverb is added between the extraction site of the subject (SpecT) and its landing site in the C-domain. In this paper, we provide a new type of evidence for an AL-component that does not involve the addition of visible material between CP and TP. We rather increase the structural distance between the extraction site and the target position through subextraction from the subject. This configuration has not been considered much in the AL-literature because subjects are islands in most languages. We provide novel data from Igbo (Benue Congo, Nigeria), a language in which DP subjects are not (absolute) islands, and show that it exhibits a pattern related to subject extraction that is expected to arise if AL constrains A'-movement. For concreteness, we show that (a) short and long subject extraction is blocked in Igbo, while (b) short as well as long subextraction from a subject is possible. The discussion of long dependencies will involve repairs of the that-trace configuration in Igbo. Our empirical arguments mainly come from language-specific A'-movement diagnostics (reflexes of A'-movement, phi-(mis)matching between resumptives and their antecedents). These make it possible (i) to show that there is no local subject A'-movement in the language (something which is notoriously difficult to show in subject-initial languages; we also provide new empirical evidence for this claim,  which we had already made in Amaechi & Georgi 2019), and (ii) to tease apart various derivational options for long A'-dependencies (movement, base-generation, prolepsis). (Version 2 is identical to version 1 except for the correction of a typo that concerns the tones of the matrix verb in example (19a).)<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008358/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008358<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Proceedings of NELS 54</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>antilocality, subextraction from subjects, that-trace effect, subject/non-subject asymmetries, igbo, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/008358/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2024]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>656 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008358">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008358">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
