(2) John didnâ€™t come (to the) pub yesterday. In this paper I report the basic empirical facts of P-D-drop and constraints on its availability, and propose an analysis for the phenomenon. I argue that in cases of P-D-drop there is no structurally represented P or D, and, following Gehrke & Lekakou (2013), I show that properties of P-D-drop goals suggest that they can be analysed as pseudo-incorporated nouns. If P-D-drop really does involve pseudo-incorporation of truncated nominal structure, then some nominal elements that look structurally large (viz., proper names) must actually be base generated as reduced structures, much smaller than DP (as has been suggested in much previous literature). I adopt the idea from Levin (2015) that pseudo-incorporation in this case is a last resort licensing mechanism, allowing a reduced nominal to be licensed where it would otherwise lead to a Case Filter violation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004771/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004771<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Proceedings of NELS 49</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pseudo-incorporation, prepositionless goals, p-drop, dialect syntax, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>263 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004771">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004771">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
