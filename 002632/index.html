In recent literature it has received a number of syntactic treatments in terms of feature-checking. This paper presents a previously unattested PCC pattern from Slovenian, where the freedom in the linear order of clitics gives rise to both standard Weak and Strong PCC patterns as well as “inverse” PCC patterns in which the restrictions on the accusative (direct object) and dative (indirect object) clitic are reverse from the one in the standard PCC patterns. It is shown that the PCC is unrelated to Case assignment, contrary to what most current syntactic accounts assume. To deal with this and a new approach to the PCC is proposed, which based on valuation of person features on clitic and weak pronouns through Agree with a functional head. It is also shown that this approach extends rather straightforwardly to PCC patterns in other languages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002632/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002632<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002632">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002632</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms. UConn</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agree; clitic movement; deficient pronouns; person-case constraint; pcc; slovenian; unvalued interpretable features, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1076 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002632">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002632">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
