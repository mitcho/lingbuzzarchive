Whether the two constructions exhibit asymmetries has served as empirical support for a unified or non-unified approach. Contra the lack of judgment consensus on the English facts, I show that Mandarin Chinese provides data exhibiting variable binding reconstruction effects in both constructions and confirming the generalization that PGs are indeed more restrictive than ATB gaps in their licensing categories. I argue that these findings can be captured along the lines of the sideward movement approach (Hornstein & Nunes 2002) with parametric variation taken into consideration, thus in support of a version of the unified approach to deriving the two constructions. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007207/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007207<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Syntax (To appear)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>parasitic gap construction, across-the-board construction, unified approach, sideward movement, variable binding reconstruction, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>398 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007207">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007207">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
