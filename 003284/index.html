Output-drivenness requires any discrepancies between underlying and output forms to be driven exclusively by phonotactics. Tesar (2013) and Magri (to appear) provide tight guarantees for OT output-drivenness and idempotency through conditions on the faithfulness constraints. This paper derives analogous faithfulness conditions for HG idempotency and output-drivenness and develops an intuitive interpretation of the various OT and HG faithfulness conditions thus obtained. The intuition is that faithfulness constraints measure the phonological distance between underlying and output forms. They should thus comply with a crucial axiom of the definition of distance, namely that any side of a triangle is shorter than the sum of the other two sides. This intuition leads to a faithfulness triangle inequality which is shown to be equivalent to the faithfulness conditions for idempotency and output-drivenness. These equivalences hold under various assumptions, crucially including McCarthy’s (2003b) generalization that (faithfulness) constraints are all categorical.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003284/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003284<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Logic, Language, and Information</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>constraint-based phonology; formal analysis; opacity; theory of faithfulness, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>490 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003284">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003284">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
