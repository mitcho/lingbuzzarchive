This idea is captured by the linguistic relativity hypothesis, also known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which proposes that language shapes cognition and behavior. According to this hypothesis, different languages may lead to different cognitive patterns and behaviors among their speakers, depending on how they encode various aspects of reality. One of the domains that may be influenced by language is temporal and spatial cognition, which are fundamental aspects of human cognition that allow us to perceive, remember, and reason about time and space. However, it is still poorly understood how language influences these cognitive domains and whether different languages lead to different ways of thinking. This study aimed to address this gap by examining the effects of language on temporal and spatial cognition among speakers of six languages from three language families: West Slavic (Polish and Slovakian), Finno-Ugric (Hungarian and Finnish), and Indo-European (English and German). The study used a series of tasks that assessed the participants’ perception of time and space in various dimensions, such as duration, distance, and reference points. The results showed significant differences in the time estimation tasks between Finno-Ugric and West Slavic/Indo-European speakers, indicating that language affects how people perceive time. Specifically, Finno-Ugric speakers tended to perceive time intervals as more compressed than West Slavic/Indo-European speakers. The findings are important because they demonstrate that language can have a significant impact on human cognition and behavior. They also have implications for cross-cultural communication, education, and cognitive science. The study suggests that language may not only reflect, but also shape our perception of reality. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and generalizability of this finding.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007547/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007547<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Pre print</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>descriptive linguistic relativism, temporal cognition, spatial cognition, memorization task, finno-ugric, west slavic, indo-european, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>184 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007547">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007547">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
