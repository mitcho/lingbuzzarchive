I have looked at various classes of denominals in English and Romanian, trying to capture the differences between languages. The most important difference is that the noun and the denominal verb generally have the same form in English (dance-to dance, corral-to corral, butter-to butter a.o.), while this is not the case in Romanian (dans- a dansa), where the verb presents an additional suffix which has a different form depending upon the conjugation at stake. I have shown that, if one desires to create a more homogeneous analysis for denominals in English and Romanian, one can claim that there is only one item in the lexicon in both languages (a noun), and that the verb is generated syntactically. On the other hand, if one wishes to create a contrast between languages, one can claim that English stores only the verb, while Romanian stores the thematic vowel and the noun, but does not store the verb, or it stores both the noun and the verb. I personally find the homogeneous view more appealing, as an account that accommodates more languages is preferable to one that does not.
English and Romanian denominals do not differ only in that Romanian has a verbal ending for the verbs, there are other differences as well: the prefixation with în- of so many denominals in Romanian, in contrast with English (but not with other Germanic languages), the absence of complex resultatives in the presence of locative denominals in Romanian (but their presence in English) a. o. From a productivity stand, Romanian is poorer in denominal verbs than English: while Romanian more often than not chooses periphrastic means of expressing a verb-noun meaning (for instance, a aranja pe raft ‘to put on shelf’), English chooses a single item (to shelve).
Throughout the thesis, I have evaluated the explanatory power of the phrasal spell-out approach, the DM approach and the spanning approach with respect to the behaviour of denominals. I have looked at Theme denominals (to dance) location verbs (to shelve), locatum verbs (to butter), in other words, the major classes of denominals that Hale & Keyser (2002) have dealt with and some very important problematic cases (pseudoagentives, like 'to spy' , instrument verbs , like 'to hammer, weather verbs), and I have come to the conclusion that the spanning approach provides a much more elegant and economical account than nanosyntax.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002923/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002923<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>still unpublished</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>spanning, phrasal spell-out, denominals</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>293 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002923">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002923">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
