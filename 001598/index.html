This view of pro-forms explains why, if traces are viewed as original copies,  these originals can convert to pronouns without violating inclusiveness, and is a more satisfying account of how pro-forms are represented in a symbolic cognitive architecture than a feature [+pronominal] (or, generalized, [+pro-form]), and accounts for the similarities between pronouns and deletion sites that have led some to take deletion sites to be pro-forms.  This analysis, however, argues the reverse- that pro-forms involve deletion, and that rather than assimilating deletion to pro-forms, deletion is basic.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001598/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001598<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, anaphora, pro-forms, deletion, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>644 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001598">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001598">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
