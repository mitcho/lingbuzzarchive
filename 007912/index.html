In RD, elements are displaced to the right of the sentence, either leaving a gap (gapped right dislocation, GRD) or a correlate (dislocation copying, DC). Despite remarkable structural similarities, GRD is often analyzed as having a monoclausal structure and DC as having a biclausal structure. Drawing on novel evidence from Cantonese and Mandarin, this paper argues that a non-uniform treatment is unwarranted and both GRD and DC are biclausal. It is proposed that GRD and DC share a unified syntax involving two underlying clauses, where the second one involves movement and deletion. The difference between GRD and DC is in the use of empty categories, which are abundant in Chinese but whose role has been largely unaddressed in previous studies of RD. I show that properties of empty categories in the first clause not only capture different variants of GRD, but also correctly rule out a range of illicit cases. The findings allow for a simpler yet empirically more adequate grammar of RD in Chinese, and moreover support a uniform view on RD across languages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007912/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007912<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>right dislocation, biclausal approach, empty categories, cantonese, mandarin chinese, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>269 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007912">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007912">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
