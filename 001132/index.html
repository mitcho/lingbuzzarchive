For example, while predominantly discrete, phonological representations also vary continuously, as evidenced by instrumental studies of both grammatically-induced sound alternations and speech errors. Can an integrated theoretical framework address both aspects of structure? The framework we introduce here, Gradient Symbol Processing, characterizes the emergence of grammatical macrostructure from the Parallel Distributed Processing microstructure (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1986) of language processing. The mental representations that emerge, Distributed Symbol Systems, have both combinatorial and gradient structure. They are processed through Subsymbolic Optimization-Quantization, in which an optimization process favoring representations that satisfy well-formedness constraints operates in parallel with a distributed quantization process favoring discrete symbolic structures. We apply a particular instantiation of this framework, &#955;-Diffusion Theory, to phonological production. Simulations of the resulting model suggest that Gradient Symbol Processing offers a way to unify accounts of discrete grammatical competence with both discrete and continuous patterns in language performance.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001132/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001132<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In press, Cognitive Science</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>distributed representations, combinatorial structure, optimization, harmonic grammar, selection, incomplete neutralization, speech errors, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001132/v3.pdf">v3 [May 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001132/v2.pdf">v2 [August 2011]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001132/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2010]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1314 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001132">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001132">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
