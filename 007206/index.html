We investigate several perfect/iamitive/‘already’ markers in Nafsan, Toqabaqita, Unua, Javanese, and Mandarin Chinese. We argue that characteristics that have been taken as evidence to necessarily posit iamitives, including the availability of the change-of-state meaning or the lack of the experiential function, can be explained by the interaction between the perfect/‘already’ and the following language-internal mechanisms: (a) aspectual coercion in languages with underspecified verbal aspect can explain the presence of the change-of-state meaning with perfect aspect; (b) paradigmatic blocking can explain the lack of some perfect functions of a given marker in a language; and (c) compatibility in meaning can explain certain overlaps between perfect and ‘already’. This approach of identifying fine-grained meanings can also facilitate large-scale typological comparisons, as the distribution of these fine-grained meanings can be systematically tested for correlation with other language-internal mechanisms.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007206/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007206<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>in revision</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>aspect, perfect, already, iamitive, linguistic category, austronesian, oceanic, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>394 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007206">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007206">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
