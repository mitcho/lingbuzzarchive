We offer a wide range of arguments for why exclamatives are assertive, including the facts that they can be directly negated, and that they can be used as responses to information-seeking questions. Like emotive verbs, exclamatives convey a presupposition not of factivity but of subjective veridicality: i.e., they rely on the speaker’s belief that the propositional content is true and do not require that it is actually true. Exclamations, in other words, presuppose belief of truth about p (veridicality) by the speaker, and assert the emotion of surprise or unexpectedness about the degree expressed in p. This produces intensity. Our analysis extends to many mirative phenomena, and implies that there is no need to posit a special speech act for exclamatives or to suppose that exclamatives are a distinct clause type.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004838/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004838<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>assertion; emotive predicate; exclamative; german; greek, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>96 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004838">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004838">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
