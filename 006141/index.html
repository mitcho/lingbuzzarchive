We show how computational cognitive modeling can be used to identify which options could lead to specific non-adult-like language behavior, using the case study of Spanish subject pronoun interpretation by typically-developing children. In a picture-selection task, children interpret subject pronouns differently from adults; modeling results suggest that both child and adult pronoun interpretation behavior is best captured by inaccuracy somewhere in the pronoun interpretation process, though how exactly children are inaccurate differs from how exactly adults are inaccurate. So, to become adult-like, children need to learn how to be inaccurate in adult-like ways. We discuss the promise and the limitations of the computational cognitive modeling approach demonstrated here for evaluating specific hypotheses about the underlying cognitive computations leading to observed language behavior.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006141/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006141<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>bayesian inference, computational cognitive modeling, knowledge deployment, knowledge representations, picture-selection task, pronoun interpretation, spanish, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006141/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>571 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006141">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006141">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
