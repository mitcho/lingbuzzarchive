The question that this thesis addresses is where the boundary of the clause-internal phase lies in light of more enriched structures. The thesis claims that when the range of modal and aspectual projections of English are considered, the empirical evidence points towards a conclusion in which progressive aspect, together with voice and the lexical verb, constitutes a discrete domain of structure to the exclusion of perfect aspect which, together with modality, TP and CP, comprises a separate, higher domain of structure. In other words, the boundary of the traditional clause-internal phase in English is in fact located between progressive and perfect aspect. Evidence for this aspectual divide arises from the fact that progressive aspect is unique amongst aspectual forms in sharing a number of properties with voice and the lexical verb across a range of phenomena including ellipsis, fronting, idioms and existential constructions. The next aspectual form above this, perfect aspect, does not share in such properties and appears to pattern more with modals and TP across the aforementioned phenomena, suggesting for a structural divide between the two aspects.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001975/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001975<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phase theory; progressive aspect; ellipsis; fronting; existential constructions; idioms, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>458 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001975">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001975">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
