`fear’ are reanalyzed from object experiencer verbs to subject experiencers with a change 
in inner aspect from telic to stative. Thus, in older English, `like’ used to mean `please’ 
and `fear’ meant `frighten.’ Cognitive factors may prefer subject over object experiencers 
because sign languages also use subject experiencers and early acquisition shows that 
subject experiencers are acquired first. However, new object experiencers arise, e.g. from 
borrowings (e.g. please and anger) and from internal change (e.g. stun and worry). One 
of the latter will be the focus of this short paper, namely stun. I explore two possible 
kinds of conditions that may make it possible for a verb with an Agent and a Theme, 
meaning `to give a blow’, to be reanalysed as a verb with a Causer and an Experiencer, 
meaning `to impress’. The two are the animacy of the arguments and coercion by outer 
aspect.
