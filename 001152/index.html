The agreement relation is extensively documented in a wide variety of syntactic contexts, establishing the empirical generalization that the complementizer agrees with its most local superordinate subject. The claim is then set forth that the complementizer agreement relation is essentially a logophoric phenomena, where a null logophoric operator within the embedded CP triggers complementizer agreement.  The paper proposes that this logophoric operator is a subject-oriented anaphor, explaining the subject-orientation of complementizer agreement, and that logophoric operators cross-linguistically vary in their syntactic nature, explaining cross-linguistic differences in logophoric phenomena.  It is shown that the agreeing complementizer occurs with all clause-selecting verbs with the exception of emotive factive verbs and that the agreeing complementizer has a specific evidential interpretation; both facts are explained by appealing to previously-established left-peripheral structures of logophoricity and evidentality.  Additional empirical contexts which are discussed include subject-to-subject raising, raising-to-object constructions, causative constructions, alternative agreement effects, passives, agreement in CP-complements of NPs, intervention effects, and subject inversion contexts, among others.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001152/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001152<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001152">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001152</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Pomona College</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>bantu, lubukusu, complementizer agreement, agree, logophoricity, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>220 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001152">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001152">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
