In the recent literature, there have been claims that the dichotomy of subordination and coordination cannot be maintained and that some constructions seem to be in between these two categories.

In this thesis, I investigate these constructions in detail. The first part is concerned with the so-called clause chaining construction and the second part is concerned with different cases of asymmetric coordination in English. 

In both parts, it is shown that the different tests to distinguish clausal relations indeed yield different results for the specific constructions. According to some tests, these constructions are subordinate; according to others, they are coordinate. It is argued, however, that this does not
necessarily mean that the established theories of clausal relations must be discarded. Most of the recent analyses of coordination assume an asymmetric coordination structure headed by an &-head selecting two arguments. This, in principle, provides for the possibility to map a subordinate structure onto
a coordinate one by means of regular transformational rules: Movement to Spec&P. As I argue, this one movement step derives all the peculiar properties of the phenomena discussed in this thesis.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002378/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002378<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002378">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002378</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Leipzig</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>subordination, coordination, clause-chaining, asymmetric coordination, conditional conjunction, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002378/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1654 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002378">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002378">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
