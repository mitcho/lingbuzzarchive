The first approach reduces Fission to a special case of iterated Vocabulary Insertion applying just in case previous cycles incompletely matched/discharged the full set of features of a syntactic terminal (Noyer 1992; Halle 1997; Harbour 2008; Campbell 2012). The second approach, laid out in Arregi and Nevins (2012), posits a distinct Fission operation which occurs derivationally prior to Vocabulary Insertion, splitting up certain features and copying all others. I argue for the latter approach on the basis of a novel set of allomorphic alternations which demonstrate that Fission (and linearization) feed (and therefore cannot be equated with) Vocabulary Insertion. I argue that a detailed comparison of discontinuous agreement paradigms across Semitic languages provides strong evidence for a modular view of the postsyntactic component whose operations are constrained by higher order principles such as locality and featural markedness.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005140/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005140<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Qualifying Paper</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>morphology; fission; discontinuous agreement; allomorphy; semitic</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>248 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005140">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005140">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
