Therefore, any phenomena that appear to challenge the argument/adjunct distinction deserve scrutiny. This squib investigates an almost unremarked-upon phenomenon of just that type: apparent in situ mixed wh-coordination (ISMW: "Mary ate WHAT and WHEN to impress Sue?!"), in which argument and adjunct wh-phrases are apparently coordinated in situ. Two analyses of ISMW are compared: the Wh-Coordination Analysis, on which the conjuncts are the wh-phrases, and the VP-Coordination Analysis, on which the conjuncts are VPs whose head Vs undergo across-the-board head movement to v. The squib argues for the VP-Coordination Analysis on conceptual and empirical grounds. Conceptually, the VP- but not the Wh-Coordination Analysis is compatible with our understanding of the argument/adjunct distinction, and involves an unremarkable derivation that it would take a stipulation to rule out; hence, the VP-Coordination Analysis is preferable. Empirically, the VP- but not the Wh-Coordination Analysis makes several correct predictions: (a) that ISMW should be impossible with obligatorily transitive verbs; (b) that adverbs should be able to follow the first wh-phrase in ISMW that cannot follow it in the left periphery; and (c) that there should be apparent in situ coordination of argument wh-phrases with different Î¸-roles. That ISMW involves VP-coordination rather than wh-coordination indicates that it in fact does not threaten the argument/adjunct distinction, contrary to initial appearances, a theoretically welcome result.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005083/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005083<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Glossa</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>argument/adjunct distinction, wh-coordination, mixed wh-coordination, vp-coordination, v-to-v, across-the-board movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>191 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005083">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005083">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
