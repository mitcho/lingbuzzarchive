We first argue that syntactic, morphological and semantic properties of object clitics in Spanish support a &#8213;mixed&#8214; analysis where 3rd person DO clitics, lo(s)/la(s), are best analyzed as determiners, and all the rest are agreement markers. Second, we analyze some important theoretical consequences of this split; it is argued that once we leave Determiner-like 3rd person DO clitics aside, all other clitics constitute a single agreement system that does not discriminate between Direct Objects and Indirect Objects, neither morphologically nor in the syntax, a conclusion supported by different kinds of evidence. First, the behavior of the object Case/animacy marker a shows (i) that inanimate and animate objects are subject to different syntactic requirements, especially in se constructions; and (ii) that only one argument may appear overtly marked by a. Furthermore, microdialectal variation receives a straightforward explanation within this model. Northern leísta dialects exhibit a complete Case/agreement paradigm, including 3rd person animate object agreement, while other dialects, including Standard Spanish and Standard leísta dialects show a gap in 3rd person of the agreement paradigm, but resort to different morphosyntactic strategies to represent phonetically null 3rd person objects.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001032/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001032<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>clitics, agreement, animacy, person, spanish, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2244 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001032">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001032">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
