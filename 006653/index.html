Significant advances are made in understanding the processes by which modern language has evolved from earlier and simpler communication systems, i.e protolanguage, or pre-language, defined by the predominant use of content words in their bare forms and labeled as grammarless. 
That said, very little is known of the evolution from the  communicative  grunts of primates to protolanguage. It is fair to say that this period of the evolution of language has attracted much less  interest, given the lack of factual support  which in the past has driven scholars to resort to conjectures and speculations as a substitute.  
The goal of the present article is to minimize this gap by making the best use of known findings and offering alternative analyses of these . The article argues that by evaluating traces of ancient forms in modern languages, i.e. “ language fossils”, the formation of language systems de novo in modern times, the formation of modern semasiographic systems, one can detect general patterns and extrapolate valuable insights into language origins. In addition, by examining  bio-cognitive features, participants in some language-relevant functions and  shared with pre-human pre-linguistic species, one can project how a new communicative behaviour could have emerged from pre-existing bio-cognitive properties, i.e. without a Language Faculty. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006653/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006653<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language origins, protolanguage, self-organization, signs, iconicity, language capacity, semasiographic systems, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>305 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006653">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006653">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
