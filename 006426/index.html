While the absolute reading and relative reading with NP-external focus are universally available across languages, the availability of the relative reading with NP-<i>internal</i> focus is restricted. In languages like English, which has overt determiners, the relative internal reading is only allowed when the focus undergoes overt movement out of the DP (Tomaszewicz 2015); as such, it is argued to be available in fragment answers to wh-questions, but not in full declaratives (Shen 2018). We designed a guessing game to investigate English-speaking adults’ and 4- and 5-year-old children’s interpretations of superlatives in full and fragment answers to wh-questions. The results reveal that for adults, the availability of the relative internal reading is indeed restricted to fragment answers; on the other hand, 4- and 5-year-olds can be led to accept the relative reading in both full and fragment answers. We discuss a possible explanation for the observed difference between adults and children involving the recasting of the puppet’s declarative sentences as fragments, effectively neutralizing the difference between full and fragment answers. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006426/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006426<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the 46th Boston University Conference on Language Development</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>superlatives, fragment answers, ellipsis, acquisition, child language, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>276 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006426">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006426">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
