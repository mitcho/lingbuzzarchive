According to some accounts, when listeners hear a sentence like, “Sarah solved some of the math problems” they infer by default that the stronger statement involving “all” is not true (i.e., that Sarah did not solve all of the problems). However, drawing on tests of reading time, eye-tracking, and manipulations of cognitive load, multiple studies have argued that this form of inference - called scalar implicature - is not computed by default. In this study, while acknowledging this claim, we explore whether important sub-processes of implicature might nevertheless involve default inferences. In particular, we tested whether listeners assume by default that speakers are knowledgeable about the utterances that they make - a critical precondition for computing scalar implicature. To do this, we tested 60 English speaking participants, who heard utterances made by either knowledgeable speakers - where scalar implicatures were expected - or ignorant speakers - where implicatures were not expected. Also, half of these participants were placed under cognitive load using a dot-array memory task. We replicated the previous finding that, when under load, participants compute fewer implicatures than expected when a speaker is knowledgeable. However, we also found that participants placed under load over-computed implicatures when speakers were ignorant - as though assuming that they were knowledgeable by default. These results are compatible with Neo-Gricean accounts of implicature, but difficult to explain on accounts which argue that scalar implicatures are computed entirely by default.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006865/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006865<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>scalar implicature, ignorance implicature, default reasoning, cognitive load, epistemic reasoning, contextual processing, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>263 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006865">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006865">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
