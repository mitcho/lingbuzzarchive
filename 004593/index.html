The aim of this paper is to give some information about Amharic-English code-switching. It addresses different issues in related with Amharic-English code-switching. Amharic is SOV language, whereas English is SVO language. 
Since Ethiopia is a multilingual country, code-switching is obviously known between different language speakers. Especially the educated people is mostly switch a code to English while speaking Amharic. And Amharic is serving as a lingua franca and the working language of the federal government for this multilingual nation-Ethiopia. Therefore, some linguistic issues in Amharic-English code-switching are raised in this paper.
According to Kiranmayi, N.C (2010) code-switching is mixing more than one language by bilinguals or multilinguals in a discourse. Code-switching is existing between two or more bilingual or multilingual speakers. When they are speaking together they may use different languages in alternative way. Someone may code-switches using two different languages (Interlingua) or different dialects of the same language (intralingua) interchangeably in a single communication. 
Code-switching may occur in different linguistic aspects in both conversational functions and structural aspects like to indicate a direct quotation, reported speech, interjection, reiteration, message qualification, referential and idiomatic expressions, content and system morpheme distinction, syntactic categories and frequency of switched segments, universal constraints, etc.
