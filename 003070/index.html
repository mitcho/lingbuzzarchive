This is the case, for example, for Kiezdeutsch, a new German dialect, as well as urban vernacular varieties of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish: descriptively speaking, in these varieties, subject-verb inversion may be absent under certain well-defined conditions. In this article I outline those conditions and the type of syntactic analysis required to account for them, claiming that an articulated left periphery is needed to account for the findings. The similarity of the V3 patterns found in these new varieties, which are geographically isolated from each other but which share a characterization in terms of the demographics of their speaker groups, invites a diachronic account in terms of language contact. I argue that transfer cannot account for V3, but that a scenario of sequential simplification and complexification is able to do so. Finally, turning to Old English, which exhibits similar (though not identical) V2/V3 alternations, I argue that a similar synchronic analysis can be upheld and that its diachronic origins may well also have been similar – a case of using the present to inform our approach to the past.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003070/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003070<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Comparative Germanic Linguistics 20(1), 49–81</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language contact, verb-second, verb-third, new germanic varieties, old english, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003070/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>339 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003070">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003070">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
