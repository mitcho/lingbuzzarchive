The account is based on a proposal that there is a difference in the timing of labeling between the basic case where a head and a phrase merge and the case where two phrases merge, as well as a particular labeling-based approach to antilocality.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002452/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002452<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in The Linguistic Review: Special issue on labeling</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>adjunct condition, antilocality, labels, locality, phases, subject condition, that-trace effect, tucking in</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002452/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2715 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002452">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002452">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
