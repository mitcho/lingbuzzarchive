A major theme in the discussion is how different theories define _morphology_, and how such definitions relate to research in morphological theory. The paper is organized around three large questions. The first concerns what it might mean to reduce syntactic variation to morphology or to the lexicon. Well-known approaches that are regarded as doing this have relatively little to do with morphology as understood in morphological theory; at the same time, one of these likes of research provides a plausible way of encoding variation in the features of syntactic terminals. A second question concerns what syntactic approaches to morphology like Distributed Morphology add to the study of universals and variation. I examine these questions with a focus on the PF (Phonological Form) interface, which plays a prominent role in this type of theory. A key theme is that there are possible universals in this part of the grammar, but care must be taken to seek them at an appropriate level of abstraction. Finally, I examine an alternative conception of PF that arises in certain Minimalist discussions. According to this view, the need to have syntactic structures connect with language-external systems– what is referred to as _externalization_– is responsible for apparent syntactic variation. If this conjecture were correct, much of what has previously been analyzed as part of the syntax is actually part of the PF component. However, it remains to be seen how it can be investigated empirically.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007251/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007251<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in The Cambridge Handbook of Comparative Syntax</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>morphology, p(honological) f(orm), lexicon, externalization, locality, universals, variation, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>607 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007251">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007251">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
