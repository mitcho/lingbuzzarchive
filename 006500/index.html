Given that by now a substantial amount of empirical evidence in support of such an operation has been accumulated, impoverishment can be viewed as a good argument in favour of the post-syntactic approach, given a Chomskyan Y-model of grammar in which inflectional morphology is an autonomous component of grammar. Against this background, the main goal of the present contribution is to show that a pre-syntactic approach to impoverishment becomes available if the complete well-formed sets of morpho-syntactic features that are required in any non-syntactic realizational approach to inflectional morphology (Stump (2001), Inkelas (2016)) are not given a declarative characterization (as is normally assumed), but arise incrementally, by iterated addition of features. On this view, pre-syntactic impoverishment is actually late addition of context features, giving rise to premature exponence. Consequently, the interaction between impoverishment and morphological exponence is not one of bleeding (as in post-syntactic approaches) but one of counter-feeding. While pre-syntactic impoverishment is basically a mirror image of post-syntactic impoverishment, it turns out to be more restrictive since it cannot affect inherent features: Features that are not added cannot be added late. This prediction is confirmed by evidence from gender and inflection class. Finally, the new concept of impoverishment is implemented in a pre-syntactic model of inflectional morphology based on Harmonic Serialism (Mueller (2020)).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006500/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006500<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>distributed morphology, optimality theory, harmonic serialism, syncretism, gender, inflection class, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>370 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006500">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006500">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
