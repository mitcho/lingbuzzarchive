I argue that polarity-sensitivity of these clauses in Russian arises because the subjunctive particle "by" comes with a focus feature from the lexicon, and activates subdomain alternatives of the predicate it combines with. These alternatives are later on acted upon by a focus operator (O-ALT), which requires that all the alternatives to the prejacent are entailed by it. This makes meanings of sentences with subjunctive complements under 'remember' logically trivial in cases when the sentence is not SDE with respect to the embedded proposition, giving rise to the polarity-sensitivity of subjunctive embedding. One consequence of this proposal is that clausal weak NPIs are treated on par with pronominal weak NPIs: the only difference between the two is that the latter are indefinite expressions ranging over individuals, whereas the former are indefinites ranging over situations.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007471/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007471<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under Review (FASL31)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>clausal embedding, polarity, focus, subjunctive mood, russian, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>172 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007471">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007471">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
