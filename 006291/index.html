These complement clause types are selected by different classes of verbs. The current paper sets out to study how exactly the selection of the complement clauses works.

In contrast to English and many other languages where the types of complementizers heading over the complement clauses appear to determine the selection, the complementizers have a little direct role in the selection mechanism in Amharic. The important attribute for the selection turns out to be the features available in the sub-CP domain. For a class of verbs selecting finite complement clause, the perfective aspect appears to be the crucial feature, whereas the imperfective feature is the target of nonfinite clause selecting predicates.

This kind of nonlocal kind of selection is at odds with the standard assumption that selection is effected via a strictly local relationship between the selector and the selectee syntactic objects. In this paper, I will argue that while the selection relation appears to be nonlocal, the locality assumption can still be saved if we allow Agree relationship to be established between the lower functional layers of the complement domain and the C head.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006291/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006291<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Work in progress: comments are welcome</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>amharic, complement clauses, complementation, complementizer, selection, c-selection, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006291/v3.pdf">v3 [December 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006291/v2.pdf">v2 [November 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006291/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>467 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006291">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006291">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
