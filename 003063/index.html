In English answering ‘no’ to a negative yes-no question confirms the negative alternative, in Chinese it disconfirms the negative alternative. In Chinese, particularly Taiwanese, the answer cannot be a bare negative answer particle, in English it can be. At the same time two theories of the syntax of questions are compared. One claims that the yes-no question particle maps the content proposition of the question, positive or negative, to a set consisting of it and its negation, and the answer  confirms or disconfirms the content proposition. The other claims that the yes-no question contains a polarity variable assigned a value by the answer. It is argued that most yes-no questions in Taiwanese conform to the first theory, while most yes-no questions in English conform to the second. The reason why the answer ‘no’ in Taiwanese has to be supplemented with spelled out sentential material is that the sentence inherited from the question cannot be deleted because it is modified by the answer particle, hence is not identical with its antecedent. In English the inherited sentence is assigned a polarity value by the answer particle. It can thereby be identical, in Merchant’s (2001) sense, with the antecedent sentence, and be deleted.  <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003063/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003063<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>yes-no questions, answers, ellipsis, identity, negation, taiwanese, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003063/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1105 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003063">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003063">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
