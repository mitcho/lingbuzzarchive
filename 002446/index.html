Such feature based account introduces a sense that syntax is “language-free” (see Starke 2009 for details); cross-linguistic similarities and differences are rather due to the feature/s, and all linguistic phenomena and structures can be analysed syntactically which can be summarised as 'there are features, and none other enters into computation.'
	This tenet seems to be promising in cross-linguistic, cross-modality studies specially in the study of various aspects of structure in sign language which have no parallel in spoken language which are generally dubbed as sign language universals. One such phenomenon is a type of pointing gesture in sign language that the signer uses to point to someone or something either manually and/or non-manually with the eye gaze or the body orientation. It is often labelled as INDEX, and is used to refer to an object, referents, spatial location, or events around the signer and the addressee in a common observable space. In sign language literature, such phenomena are generally ascribed to the modality differences that the sign language employ. Such ascriptions, however, paradoxically fail to provide account of phenomena arising from the same C-I system as the difference between sign and spoken language is the difference of the S-M system that impose different optimal conditions for convergence rather than the difference of the C-I system. 
	This paper aims to address that the 'modality differences' do not make sign language unique by virtue of its S-M system, rather the interface requirements of the S-M system creates the differences in terms of the feature, and INDEX refers to such feature(s). It aims to provide an account of the structure building feature(s) associated with various instances of INDEX in Indian Sign Language based on feature inventory sugggested by Wiltschko (2009), Nevins (2007), Harbour (2006), Déchaine and Wiltschko (2002, 2007), Ghomeshi, Paul and Wiltschko (2009), etc. among others. 
	This paper is divided into four broad sections. In section 2, the facts relating to INDEX in Indian Sign Language are described specifically showing the multiple syntactic functions of INDEX in the grammar of Indian Sign Language. A summary of the previous analyses of INDEX in sign language literature is provided to highlight the inadequacies in the explanation of the phenomenon under discussion in section 3. In the following concluding section, based on feature inventory, the papers draws a feature inventory of INDEX in Indian Sign Language, and shows that it is associated with multiple features in congruity; and each instance of INDEX refers to the feature(s).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002446/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002446<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002446">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002446</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>localisation, index, feature, value, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1388 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002446">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002446">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
