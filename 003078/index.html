Both realizations display restrictions on subject selection: in embedded contexts, the subject of a directive clause cannot be co-referential with the matrix context. This restriction, known as subject obviation, has been previously discussed mostly in relation to subjunctive embedding, and not observed with imperatives. A similar restriction arises with all directive clauses also in matrix contexts, namely: the subject of a matrix directive clause cannot be first person exclusive. I argue that both restrictions are manifestations of the same phenomenon, a generalized subject obviation. I propose that the restriction arises due to a binding restriction which applies between the subject of directive clauses and a perspectival PRO in the specifier of MoodP. I suggest that this PRO is required for the interpretation of a directive operator in Mood and serves as a grammatical representation for the source of the directive speech act realized by directive clauses. As such it is semantically bound by either an expression referring to the speaker, in matrix clauses, or the matrix subject in embedded clauses. The latter is a parallel to subject control constructions. I show that this analysis not only derives the generalized subject obviation effect, but that it also correctly predicts other restrictions that occur with directive clauses, such as the absence of the exclusive first person subject ban in questions. The ban is correctly predicted to apply to second person subjects in questions instead, which explains the cross-linguistic absence of imperatives in matrix questions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003078/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003078<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms. UConn (submitted)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>imperatives, embedded imperatives, subjunctives, directive clauses, slovenian, subject obviation, control, binding, performative modals, de se attitudes, interrogative perspective shift, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003078/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>772 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003078">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003078">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
