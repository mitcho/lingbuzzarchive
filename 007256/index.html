I focus on the impact of Armenian data on current theories of underspecification, feature geometry, consonant-vowel interactions, syllabification, vowel harmony, and constraints and repairs. Some of the more interesting theoretical claims of this thesis are that languages can assign consonants to syllable nuclei at an intermediate point in derivations, even though these consonants always surface as syllable margins; uvulars, epiglottals, and pharyngeals are in a relationship analogous to that between high, mid, and low vowels, and the Lower Vocal Tract node dominating these segments occupies a position directly parallel to the traditional Place node; contour segments show only edge effects and no antiedge effects; voiceless but not voiced fricatives are [+spread glottis]; the common phenomenon of nasal voicing is controlled by a marking statement *[+nasal, +spread glottis], contrary to the traditional view involving the configuration *[+nasal, -continuant]; and voiced aspirates are best viewed as simple segments characterized by the features [ stiff vocal folds, +spread glottis].
The thesis is divided into five chapters: the first sets out the theoretical assumptions on which I base my work; chapter two presents a basic overview of Armenian phonology focusing on stress assignment,
syllabification, and vowel harmony; chapter three develops an account of syllabification and epenthesis in the literary dialects; chapter four considers evidence bearing on the feature geometric component of universal grammar; and chapter five examines the phonological behavior of laryngeal features in the Armenian dialect of New Julfa and presents an analysis of the consonant shifts which occurred in the modem Armenian and Indo-Aryan dialects.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007256/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007256<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Harvard University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>armenian, phonology, indo-european, syllabification, vowel harmony, stress, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>238 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007256">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007256">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
