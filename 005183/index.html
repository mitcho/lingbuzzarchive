which leads to the assumption that they should be analyzed independently,
even though they both illustrate an asymmetry between
subjects and objects. By looking at various phenomena in English,
German, Spanish and Norwegian I propose that this parallel behavior
is not accidental, but that there is a previously unnoticed generalization:
subextraction is allowed iff extraction is possible and
the target of subextraction is not an indirect object. In order to account
for the facts, I propose that a revised version of Spec-to-Spec
antilocality (Erlewine 2016) is necessary: movement of and out of
an XP must cross a Projection Line (PL) (Brody 1998), i.e. the set
of all projections of a head. I show that this version of antilocality
is appropriate to derive Freezing effects, Huang’s (1982) CED, and
their exceptions; and Comp-trace effects and their neutralization, including
subextraction cases. However, antilocality on its own cannot
derive the extraction-subextraction asymmetry in indirect objects. I
propose that the Principle of Minimal Compliance (PMC) (Richards
1998) can suspend antilocality if agree between a probe and a goal
has happened first. The version adopted here will allow extraction
of the whole XP, but disallow extraction of its specifier due to the
lack of a prior agree relation. Antilocality and the PMC combined
also make the right predictions in other domains such as the lack of
do-support in matrix subject questions and A-movement of the subject
in declarative clauses, providing evidence that antilocality is a
constraint that should apply to (at least) both A and A’-movement<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005183/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005183<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Accepted for publication Linguistic Variation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>extraction, subextraction, freezing, antilocality, principle of minimal compliance, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005183/v3.pdf">v3 [January 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005183/v2.pdf">v2 [January 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005183/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>858 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005183">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005183">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
