The obtained data, as well as cross-linguistic evidence, suggest that the clausal construction must have been the source of the adverbial one. A proposal is presented that could explain that development. The data show, in addition, that the grammatical properties and usage patterns of the clausal and adverbial constructions were very similar until the 16th century but have been diverging ever since. This divergence coincides with an exponential increase in the textual raw frequency of the adverbial construction, where word order fixation, erosion of the inflectional morphology and a change in the possibilities for time adjunction among others are found to occur at around the same time. This points towards a desentencialization, loss of inner structure and grammaticalization of the adverbial construction in those periods.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004478/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004478<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Historical Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>temporal hacer, spanish, diachrony, grammaticalization, desententialization, corpus linguistics, categorization, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>237 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004478">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004478">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
