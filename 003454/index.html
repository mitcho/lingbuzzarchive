Firstly, when Hungarian pronouns bear an oblique case, the case marker must be followed by possessive agreement. Secondly, this pronoun-case-agreement order contrasts with the order found in garden variety possessive structures: ordinary possessive DPs feature the order noun-agreement-case. The goal of this paper is to offer an account of these puzzling phenomena. I argue that a PP structure in which PPs are projected from a silent place noun and the Ground is merged as the possessor of place (Terzi, 2005, 2008, 2010; Botwinik-Rotem, 2008; Botwinik-Rotem and Terzi, 2008; Pantcheva, 2008; Cinque, 2010a; Noonan, 2010, and Nchare and Terzi, 2014) allows an elightening analysis of the appearance and position of the possessive agreement in PPs. I also discuss how certain surface differences between PPs and ordinary possessive constructions can be accounted for while maintaining the possessive analysis of PPs. By showing that a PP structure with a possessive core yields a natural account of the intricate Hungarian data, the paper strengthens the case for a possessive-based approach to PPs in Universal Grammar.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003454/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003454<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Natural Language and Linguistic Theory 36(2): 365-400. 2018</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pp, place, oblique case, possessive structure, possessive agreement, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>351 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003454">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003454">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
