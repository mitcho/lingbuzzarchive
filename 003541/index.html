Frederick Klaeber defines Old English motan as “may, have opportunity, be allowed”, all of which are quite different from the modern “must”. To explain the patterns of usage of motan in ninth-century Old English, Igor Yanovich convincingly proposes that the verb really had only one sense somewhere between “may” and “must”, and that its range of translations arises from the fact that this meaning is hard to express in modern English. Yanovich’s analysis, however, was limited to the ninth-century corpus of Alfredian texts, so he did not discuss whether the semantics of the verb, which had already mutated dramatically by Chaucer, remained the same in other Old English works. Beowulf is a good Old English text in which to examine the usage of motan for several reasons. Firstly, it is quite long, so there are many occurrences of what is a remarkably infrequent modal verb. In addition, it has several unclear passages containing motan, so any insight about the verb’s general meaning in the language of the poem could help explain these sections. Finally, the dating of  Beowulf  is hotly contested. Thus, placing the poem’s use of motan within a timeline of development could offer clues about when the poem was composed. After examining many occurrences of motan within  Beowulf , it is clear that the usage of motan fits the schema observed by Yanovich in Alfredian Old English. Moreover, Yanovich’s semantics for motan offer insight about how we should interpret several of the notoriously unclear passages in  Beowulf.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003541/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003541<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>modality, variable force modality, old english, motan, beowulf, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>184 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003541">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003541">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
