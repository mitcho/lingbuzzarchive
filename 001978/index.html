We will show that some long-standing assumptions about the distribution of nonnominal subjects (going back to Koster 1978 and Stowell 1981) are incorrect, and that the distribution of these subjects is broader than previous analyses have acknowledged. We suggest that previous conclusions about this class of data were driven by facts whose explanation likely lies outside the realm of syntactic structure. While much of the debate about the status of sentential subjects occurred twenty to thirty years ago, the issue is still quite relevant, inasmuch as a number of current syntax textbooks still present what turn out to be questionable analyses of these structures (see Culicover 1997; Haegeman and GueÂ´ron 1999; Lasnik 1999, 1995; and Radford 1997). This is, to some degree, surprising, especially given the fact that the Case theoretic explanations for the facts have declined in importance with the paradigm shift from Principles and Parameters (i.e., GB) to the Minimalist Program. What follows is an attempt to lay out previously established facts as well as some new ones, to call attention to long-standing misconceptions about sentential subjects, to distill the correct generalization for subject positions in English, and to point to
potential sources of new data on the topic.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001978/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001978<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Donna B.
