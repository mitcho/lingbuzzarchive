This approach derives a scale of rational numbers between 0 and 1 for such adjectives, a totally closed-scale in the sense of Kennedy & McNally (2005). I show that the approach successfully accommodates the interaction of closed-scale adjectives with a full range of fractional modifiers, such as "half" and "three quarters," but also modified fractions, such as "more than half" and "less than two thirds." I analyze these fractional modifiers as fractions themselves, and thereby assimilate their analysis to that of ordinary (modified) numerals. I show that the analysis naturally extends to both color terms,  as well as to denominal adjectives, such as "wooden" and "golden," which are also compatible with fractional modifiers (Kennedy & McNally 2010; Paill√© 2021). I further discuss data that calls into question the idea that fractions cannot modify open-scale adjectives, with implications for the basic meaning of adjectives as sets of states (Wellwood 2014; Wellwood 2015; Cariani et al. 2023).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007437/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007437<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in the Proceedings of CLS59</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>adjectives, measure functions, ratios, fractions, modifiers, states, degrees, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>220 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007437">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007437">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
