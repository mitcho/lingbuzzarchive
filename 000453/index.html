The status of linguistics as psychology, the psychological reality of grammars, the character of tacit knowledge and the role of intuitions as data remain heatedly disputed today. I argue that the recalcitrance of these disputes is symptomatic of deep misunderstandings. I focus attention on Michael Devitts recent extended critique of Chomskyan linguistics along the lines of earlier critiques by Quine, Searle and others. I suggest that Devitts characteristic complaints are based on a failure to appreciate the special status of Chomskys computational formalisms found elsewhere in cognitive science. Devitt ascribes an intentional conception of representations that Chomsky repudiates and that is independently implausible. I argue that Devitts proposed linguistic reality as the proper subject matter of linguistics neglects the problems of tokens as opposed to types and he misses the force of Chomskys arguments against Behaviourism and nominalism. I suggest that Devitts case against intuitions as data misunderstands their standard role throughout perceptual psychology. Finally, of more general interest, I argue that Devitts position exemplifies compelling errors concerning mental representation seen throughout cognitive science and philosophy of mind.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000453/current.doc">doc</a> ][ <a href="/lingbuzz/000453/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000453<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>psychological reality, knowledge of language, cognize, competence, performance, tacit knowledge, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1684 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000453">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000453">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
