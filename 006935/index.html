A previous Pokémonastics experiment with Russian speakers has found that they tend to judge names with [Ca] to be more suitable for larger, post-evolution characters than names with [Ci] (Kumagai & Kawahara 2022). This result left one question unanswered, however, since in Russian, consonants before [i] are palatalized, and hence it was not clear whether it is the vowel quality difference ([a] vs. [i]) or consonant palatalization that affected the responses in this previous experiment. This paper reports an experiment that teases apart these two interpretations by comparing three conditions: [Ca] vs. [Cja] vs. [Ci]. The result showed that names with [Cja] were judged to be least appropriate for post-evolution characters, suggesting the important role of phonemic palatalization that determines the sound symbolic judgment patterns by Russian speakers. Additionally, the current experiment tested another sound symbolic effect—--the iconicity of quantity (Haiman 1980)—--in which longer names tended to be associated with larger post-evolution Pokémon characters. We found that, like previous Pokémonastic experiments on other languages, longer names tend to be judged to be more suitable for post-evolution characters. This pattern, however, was clearly observed only when the name length was increased by the presence of a coda consonant, but not so clearly when it was increased by the presence of an onset consonant. This result suggests that for Russian speakers, mora counts, rather than segment counts, are of primary importance for determining size-related sound symbolism.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006935/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006935<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>resubmitted to Languages</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonetics, sound symbolism, pokemon, palatalization, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>379 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006935">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006935">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
