1986) in diachronic linguistics, is that doing so makes it difficult to talk about
even the most well-established results and the simplest notions. A statement
like “The English word knight began with a kn cluster in Middle English” seems innocuous
enough, until we realize that there is no scientifically useful or coherent
definition of “English”, or “Middle English”, or “the word knight”! There is obviously
no direct sense in which a mental representation in Chaucer’s mind/brain
(or even a sound Chaucer made) that we might refer to as “Chaucer’s word for
knight” has turned into a representation or sound that we might refer to as “Chomsky’s
word for knight”.
One strategy for dealing with such difficulties is to ignore them—it is shockingly
easy, as we ourselves have done for much of our professional lives, to teach
students and write papers as if English, Marshallese, and Vedic Sanskrit were
legitimate objects of scientific study. Such work engages our intellect and provides
a certain amount of satisfaction, but our acceptance of the correctness
of the I-language approach, and the problems and inconsistencies that arise by
not adopting that approach, sometimes force us to confront the contradictions
that we ourselves have helped to perpetuate. There is no question that doing
so is difficult and sometimes tedious, but we hope the investment will generate
a deeper understanding of what is traditionally called “language change”, and
ultimately allow us to reformulate informal statements, like the one about “the
word knight”, in terms that do not conflict with our basic scientific understanding
of languages as properties of individuals.
