The asymmetry states that complex event nominals such as graduate can license ellipsis of its verbal counterpart, but not vice versa. I have argued that this asymmetry can only be accounted for by a morphosyntactic containment condition to the effect that the syntactic structure of an antecedent must properly contain that of an elided constituent. I have further shown that this position receives independent support from Sugimotoâ€™s (2018) recent discovery of a similar asymmetry observed with causative alternation verbs such as break and melt, in which the causative vP structure allows the ellipsis of the inchoative VP structure, but not the other way around. The asymmetry under investigation and the analysis thereof furnish an excellent testing ground in favor of an abstract morphosyntactic derivation for zero-derived noun-verb pairs in contemporary syntactic theory, while retaining the important sights from the level-ordering hypothesis of Kiparsky (1982a, b) within his framework of Lexical Phonology.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004461/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004461<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the Workshop "Nominals at the Interfaces"</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>conversion, category mismatch, vp-ellipsis, syntactic identity, containment condition, lexical phonology, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>194 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004461">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004461">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
