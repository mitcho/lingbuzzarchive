(2014) concluded that frequency and morphological irregularity are in Spanish, unlike in English, independent variables. In this paper I take issue with that claim. On the one hand, it is argued that the borders between regularity and irregularity are diffuse. Many of the verbs classified by Fratini et al. (2014) as irregular might, therefore, not be so. In addition, the choice of lexemes they analyzed was far from adequate. Their set of irregular verbs contained many verbs formed by adding some prefix to a more frequent irregular verb (e.g. a-venir, a-tener, con-decir, con-mover...) and many highly infrequent lexemes in general, barely in use in the speech community (e.g. abnegar, ablandecer, amoblar, amodorrecer...). In an alternative corpus analysis it has been found that, when these and other shortcomings in Fratini et al. (2014) are dealt with, morphological irregularity and frequency are indeed strongly correlated variables also in Spanish.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004480/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004480<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>spanish, irregular verbs, frequency, corpus, fratini et al.
