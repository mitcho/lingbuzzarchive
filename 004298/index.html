The two types of wh-copying show distinct behavior in terms of prosody, pragmatics, binding, left branch extraction and the type of wh-phrases they license as copies. I argue that these difference follow neatly from an analysis that treats regular wh-copying as standard long distance extraction and pseudo wh-copying as an instance of wh-slifting. More specifically, the properties of regular wh-copying are identical to those of regular long distance extractions, so regular wh-copying instantiates a standard bi-clausal structure. Pseudo wh-copying, on the other hand, instantiates a bi-sentential structure. What looks like the matrix clause in pseudo wh-copying is in fact a wh-slifting sentence in which the interrogative clause is affected by sluicing. And what looks like the embedded clause in pseudo wh-copying is a repetition of the interrogative clause affected by sluicing in the wh-slifting sentence. I show that the properties of pseudo wh-copying reduce to the properties of sluicing, slifting, and the identity between the two interrogative clauses.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004298/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004298<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in: Proceedings of CLS 54</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>embedded v2, slifting, wh-copying, parentheticals, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>127 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004298">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004298">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
