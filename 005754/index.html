Even though it is studied by many, the book still closed its secrets. The drawings suggest that the 
manuscript is an herbal book and it may contain valuable information thus decoding it may 
increase human knowledge. This study has presented, a decipherment for Voynich manuscript and
examines if it conveys any meanings. It states that, Voynich is written in codes and in fact there 
are hidden text with meanings in a natural language. The final results demonstrated the existence
of words in sentence structure. Furthermore, it gives an insight into the first lines, which is a 
description of an itinerary like story; the mysterious book speaks of a person named Homer Jattari 
who passes a long distance from Pars to Parete, in search of amazing attars. The finding will prove 
the book to be a code and not a hoax.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005754/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005754<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>voynich manuscript, pattern, code, language, syntax, phonology, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>479 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005754">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005754">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
