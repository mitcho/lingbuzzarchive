In a range of environments, it has been shown that pronouns appear to mark a position in a movement chain (e.g. Zaenen et al. 1981; Koopman 1982, 1984; Sells 1984; Engdahl 1985; Pesetsky 1998; Kandybowicz 2007; Holmberg and Nikanne 2008; Harizanov 2014; Sichel 2014). I presents a novel instance of this from the Nilotic language Dinka, in which copies left by successive-cyclic movement through the edge of the vP are spelled out as pronouns. I develop an approach to these facts that forces DP copies to undergo partial deletion in the context of multiple copy spell-out, under the view that prnouns represent DPs with an absent or elided NP complement (Postal 1969; Elbourne 2001, 2005). Evidence for this approach comes from the observation that there are a variety of ways in which copied pronouns differ from ‘trueborn’ pronouns. Specifically, as I show for Dinka and a range of other patterns, copied pronouns may be imperfect copies, and display both featural mismatches and gaps (patterns in which only a subset of possible DPs are doubled by a pronoun). I show that both of these patterns can be made to follow from the way partial deletion applies.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002978/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002978<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pronouns, pronoun copying, successive-cyclic movement, resumption, clitic doubling, copy theory of movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>367 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002978">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002978">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
