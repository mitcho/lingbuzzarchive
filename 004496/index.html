Based on data from the Old Hungarian Corpus and the Hungarian Historical Corpus, I will argue that while in Old Hungarian, middle voice was encoded through a separate inflectional paradigm (contextual allomorphy in the subject agreement suffix conditional on the feature content of a silent Voice head), in Modern Hungarian, middle voice is encoded through dedicated middle voice suffixes (i.e., the Voice head is spelled out overtly). I will claim that the underlying grammaticalization process involved the reanalysis of frequentative suffixes (v heads) as middle voice suffixes (Voice heads). I will show that this reinterpretation was not based on shared abstract
features, but rather, on a principled correlation between middle voice and frequentative aspect: since some types of middles (antipassives and dispositional middles) were likelier to be associated with a frequentative or habitual reading than actives, frequentative suffixes were susceptible to be reanalyzed as middle suffixes in the course of language acquisition. I will thus claim that in addition to Feature Economy (Gelderen 2011),
reinterpretation based on correlation between featurally independent grammatical markers should also be regarded as a mechanism of grammaticalization.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004496/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004496<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Diachronica 37:1, 1-42</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>voice; grammaticalization; middles; hungarian; antipassives; anticausatives, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004496/v3.pdf">v3 [April 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004496/v2.pdf">v2 [May 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004496/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>697 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004496">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004496">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
