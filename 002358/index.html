I argue that three forces influence the apparent affiliation of the medial across different sources of evidence: articulation encourages the grouping of medials with onsets, parsing encourages the grouping of medials with rimes, and association strength modulates the effects of the other two forces. After showing that this framework explains the otherwise puzzling diversity of results in the previous literature, I describe an acceptability judgment experiment in which all three forces were minimized. The results revealed a consistently greater interaction between medials and onsets than between medials and rimes. Assuming that all three forces were truly minimized in the experiment, and that there are no other forces to consider, these results provide the most reliable evidence yet that the Mandarin medial may be represented mentally as part of the onset.
