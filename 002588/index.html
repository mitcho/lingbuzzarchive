The question is important because it tackles the interaction between human creativity  and human cognition . The basic question concerns the constraints that might be posed to artistic expression by the properties of the cognitive system, and by Universal Grammar in particular. The general issue might be expressed as follows: Is literary expression free from any grammatical constraint? And if not, in what way does grammar limit the
possibilities available for a narrator? The thesis I will develop in this chapter is that language always complies with the rules of grammar. Namely, even if there is a certain degree of freedom in the choice of a particular narrative style, the possibilities are always to be individuated inside the grammatical set  of options. In other words, the grammar adopted by a narrator using a certain literary style is the same as the grammar accounting for any normal  sentence. In this chapter I show that the peculiar flavor of a literary style such as free indirect discourse— henceforth, FID— is due to a slightly different setting of the value of certain parameters— such as the choice of temporal and spatial coordinates relevant for the interpretation of the events in the narration with respect to non-FID sentences. Crucially, however, the grammar describing and accounting for the phenomena of non-literary, “ normal,”  sentences, also accounts for the properties of the FID.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002588/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002588<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002588">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002588</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Sentence and Discourse, J.
