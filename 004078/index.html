a uniqueness implication that arises in cases that feature non-distributive predicates, such as
"How many students solved this problem together?". We attempt an analysis of this effect in
terms of Dayal’s (1996) Maximal Informativity Presupposition for questions. We observe that
such an analysis must be reconciled with the unexpected absence of uniqueness implications
in cases where the non-distributive predicate appears under a possibility modal. We explore
two possible solutions: (i) the postulation of a scopally mobile maximality operator in degree
questions of the sort proposed in Abrusan and Spector (2011); (ii) the proposal that the informativity
to be maximized is based on pragmatic, contextual, entailment rather than semantic
entailment. We explain why neither solution is satisfactory. We also observe that a Maximal
Informativity Presupposition fails to capture uniqueness implications in how many-questions
with predicates that are weakly distributive in the sense of Buccola and Spector (2016), such
as "How many students in the seminar have the same first name?". We conclude that uniqueness
implications in how many-questions have must have a source that is independent of Dayal’s
