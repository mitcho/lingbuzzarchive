To achieve this aim, a new analytical model is formed, based on assumptions revolving around the phase theory. As it turns out, the new phase-based analytical model can account for the derivations of problematic examples containing picture NP reflexives as well as those of the canonical and ECM-related sentences containing reflexives, by distinguishing two kinds of reflexives. This paper reveals that the clausemate principle can be reduced to the phasemate principle in the framework of the phase theory, and that the grammaticality of the sentences containing non-picture NP reflexives can be determined even before the whole derivations of them have been completed whereas that of the constructions containing picture NP reflexives can not.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001168/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001168<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Draft.
