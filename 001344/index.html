This law manifests itself, for example, in the blockage of Rendaku, a phenomenon which voices the initial consonant of the second member of a compound. Lyman’s Law blocks Rendaku when the second member already contains a voiced obstruent. Lyman’s Law was believed to hold only in native words, not in loanwords, because there are many loanwords that violate this restriction (e.g. [gaado] ‘guard’ and [bagu] ‘bug’: Ito and Mester 2003, 2008).
 
Building on Vance (1980), Tateishi (2003) and Nishimura (2003), however, this study shows that Lyman’s Law is active even in loanwords, or nonce words in general. In Experiments I and II, native speakers of Japanese judged Rendaku less natural when it resulted in a violation of Lyman’s Law. In Experiment III, native speakers of Japanese judged devoicing more natural when devoicing was caused by Lyman’s Law. Therefore, Lyman’s Law is active both as a blocker and a trigger of phonological alternations. A general implication of this study is that a restriction with many lexical exceptions can still impact native speakers’ behavior, as predicted by theories that posit that constraints are violable (Legendre et al., 1990a,b; Prince and Smolensky, 1993/2004).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001344/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001344<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Lingua 122(11): 1193-1206.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>japanese, rendaku, lyman's law, ocp, laboratory phonology, phonological judgments, devoicing, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001344/v3.pdf">v3 [May 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001344/v2.pdf">v2 [February 2012]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001344/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2011]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2102 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001344">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001344">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
