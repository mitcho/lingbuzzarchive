I show that examination of this type of compound poses non-trivial architectural and/or empirical difficulties for several existing variants of the lexicalist theory as in Chomsky (1970), Anderson (1982, 1992), Kiparsky (1982), Mohanan (1986), Di Sciullo and Williams (1987), and Bresnan and Mchombo (1995) because the formation of such a compound crucially requires application of regular/compositional syntactic processes to be followed by/interact with the lexical process of compounding. I argue that the Multiple Spell-Out model of syntax, as recently proposed by Uriagereka (1999) and Johnson (2003), provides a straightforward reduction of this type of compounding as a special case of regular compounding as in black board and nurse shoes. To the extent that this analysis is tenable, the current investigation provides support for the recent, non-lexicalist architecture of the lexicon-syntax interface as in Distributed Morphology that attempts to localize all types of word formation within the sole realm of syntax and for the recent derivational approach to syntax.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000599/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000599<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phrasal compounds, lexicalist hypothesis, multiple spell out, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>482 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000599">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000599">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
