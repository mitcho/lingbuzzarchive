This is based on the availability of agentless repetitive presuppositions with again, with transitives permitting a repetitive presupposition excluding the agent while intransitives do not. In this paper, we challenge Baleâ€™s claim and show that typically intransitive verbs like dance and bark, which do not usually allow agentless presuppositions, permit agentless presuppositions when they appear with an optional internal argument. To account for this, we propose that verbal roots possess an underspecified thematic role argument, along with individual and event arguments. Combined with a conservative syntax for introducing agents via VoiceP (Kratzer, 1996), the analysis captures the dependence of agentless presuppositions on the presence of an internal argument without recourse to any distinction be- tween transitive and intransitive eventive verb roots. The analysis is then extended to out-prefixation, which has recently been used as an argu- ment for syntactic and semantic severing of all arguments from the verb (Ahn, 2020). The analysis contributes a new theory of roots lying between two theoretical poles, one that argues that roots take internal arguments (Harley, 2014) and one that severs internal arguments syntactically and semantically from the verb (Schein, 1993; Borer, 2003, 2005; Ramchand, 2008; Ahn, 2020).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005384/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005384<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>roots, argument structure, again, agentless presuppositions, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>90 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005384">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005384">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
