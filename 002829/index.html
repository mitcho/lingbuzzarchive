be  re-opened.  It  is  shown  that  previous  accounts  in  terms  of  predicate  inversion, empty expletive subjects or subject extraposition fail to account for LI with preposed adjuncts and unergative verbs. Instead it will be argued that locative 
inversion in English requires a rather drastic reassessment of some of the basic 
assumptions about English grammar. On the one hand, what has been thought 
of as a subject position should be re-interpreted as a more flexible position, a 
generalized TP. On the other, it will be argued that there is altruistic movement 
of the finite verb. This exceptional verb movement is analyzed as repair-driven 
movement that helps satisfy information structural requirements of the subject: 
through movement of the verb, the (unergative) subject ends up in clause-final 
position and can thus occupy the default focus-position. I will take these facts to 
argue in favor of a model of grammar that makes use of interacting and violable 
constraints and thus expresses the notion of repair in a very direct way.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002829/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002829<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In Patrick Brandt & Eric Fu√ü (eds.): Repairs.
