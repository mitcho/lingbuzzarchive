The idea is that this marks the dependency relation between the first constituent and its sister via a linker, a process more generally found in the nominal domain. The analysis dispenses with a verb movement rule targeting a fixed functional head (such as V-to-C). There is no connection between verb-movement and (richness of) morphology, other than a consistency principle saying that the elements spelling out dependency morphologically and positionally tend to be the same. The paper analyses a range of recalcitrant verb-second phenomena in terms of positional marking of dependency (including main/embedded clause asymmetries, quotative inversion, apokoinou, and conjunction induced verb-second) and describes verb-first and verb-third phenomena as reasoned deviations from the verb-second pattern.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000029/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000029<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted to CGSW19 proceedings.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>head movement, syntax, verb-second, dependency-marking, linkers, merge</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>232 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000029">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000029">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
