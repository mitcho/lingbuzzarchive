Investigating morphological, case and referential properties of different types of PPs, I argue that PPs have a rich internal structure. I propose that in addition to the standardly assumed locative and directional projection and in addition to degree adjuncts, PPs contain T(ense)-head, which bears a valued T-feature and unvalued phi-features and which is responsible for the case assignment. I propose that syntactically, case on the prepositional complement is a reflection of the Agree operation between T-features and phi-features on the complement and T-head and semantically, it is a reflection of semantic features of the decomposed preposition. The prepositional complement can be overt as well as covert. In the case of the covert prepositional complement, case is spelled out on the closest overt element in PP. I also discuss referential properties of the covert noun and argue that they cannot be determined in the syntax.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000942/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000942<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Proceedings of Czech in Formal Grammar 2009</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pp, decomposition, case, agree, tense-head, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>991 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000942">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000942">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
