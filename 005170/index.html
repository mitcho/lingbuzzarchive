I show that extraction from these domains is sometimes licensed, both in Italian and cross-linguistically, and that it is deeply influenced by many factors, such as the position of the adjunct and its syntactic integration with the main clause. I show that different adjuncts behave differently with respect to extraction phenomena and to parasitic gaps licensing. I claim that they are not a uniform syntactic class. I propose an analysis of extraction, based on: (i) the point of merger of adjuncts in the structure, and (ii) the possibility of forming a macroevent. I claim that the former is a crucial criterion able to explain the different behaviours of adjuncts, and that it is also needed for the creation of a macroevent. I discuss also inter-speaker variability, and show that the creation of a single macroevent is able to account for these data.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005170/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005170<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD thesis, Universit√† Ca' Foscari Venezia</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>islands, adjuncts, macroevent, inter-speaker variation, syntax, syntax/semantics, experimental syntax, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>298 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005170">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005170">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
