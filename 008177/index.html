It is for writing monadic grammars to explore analyses, compare diverse languages through their categories, and to train  models of grammar from form-meaning pairs where syntax is 
latent variable.

Monadic structures are binary combinations of elements that employ semantics of composition only. TheBench is essentially old-school categorial grammar to syntacticize the idea, with the implication that although syntax is autonomous  (recall \emph{colorless green ideas sleep furiously}), the treasure
is in the baggage it carries at every step, viz. semantics, more narrowly, predicate-argument structures indicating choice of categorial reference and its consequent placeholders for decision in such structures. 

There is some new thought in old school. Unlike traditional categorial grammars, application is turned into composition in monadic analysis. Moreover,
every correspondence requires specifying two command relations, one on syntactic command and the other on semantic command. A monadic grammar of TheBench
contains only synthetic elements (called `objects' in category theory of mathematics) that are shaped by this analytic invariant, viz. composition. 
Both ingredients (command relations) of any analytic step must therefore be functions (`arrows' in category theory). TheBench is one implementation of the idea for iterative development of such functions along with grammar of synthetic elements.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008177/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008177<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>typology, computation, mathematics, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/008177/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2024]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>353 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008177">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008177">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
