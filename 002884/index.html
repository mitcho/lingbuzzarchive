How is a completive adverbial, such as in three minutes, licensed? It has been noted that either a resultative or an incremental theme in the form of a nominal that is quantified by a numeral licenses a completive adverbial. Both licensing conditions encode a bounded scale. This paper argues that the nominal in the special form can be analyzed as an element hosted in a ResultP, and thus the two conditions are also unified syntactically. The evidence for the analysis comes from the syntactic similarities and interactions between such a nominal and a VV resultative construction in Mandarin Chinese.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002884/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002884<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistics (to appear)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>completive, frequentative, durative, verbal classifier, pro, the enclitic ta, resultative, numeral, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>398 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002884">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002884">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
