The work is co-authored and edited by Hans Broekhuis. The aim of this publication is to present a synthesis of the available knowledge of Dutch syntax. It is primarily concerned with language description and not with linguistic theory, providing support to all researchers of language and linguistics, including advanced students. The first three volumes in this series, "Nouns and Noun Phrases" (see lingbuzz/001638) and “Adjectives and Adjective Phrases” (lingbuzz/001762), have been published as hardcovers as well as a (free) open access publications. A new volume, "Adpositions and Adpositional phrases" has appeared in December 2013. It discusses the internal make-up and the distribution of adpositional phrases. Topics that are covered include complementation and modification of adpositional phrases, as well as their predicative, attributive and adverbial uses. A separate chapter is devoted to the formation and the syntactic behavior of pronominal PPs like erop ‘on it’, which also includes a more general discussion of the syntax of so-called R-words like er ‘there’. The downloadable file contains a TOC, as well as a sample chapter (ch.6: R-pronominalization and R-words).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001980/current.pdf?_s=iHZhgW7APlxA6Lxz">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001980<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001980">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001980</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Amsterdam University Press (2014); also available as (free) open access publication at Oapen.org</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>adposition, modification, complementation, r-words, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001980/v2.pdf?_s=8WsNXFh8oIPU0e_l">v2 [May 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001980/v1.pdf?_s=MSH047Tb8s7hhlmb">v1 [December 2012]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1110 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001980?_s=d4PuJMz9yHahR2-V&amp;_k=TPdVMVi1a4aZaLgT&amp;2">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001980?_s=d4PuJMz9yHahR2-V&amp;_k=TPdVMVi1a4aZaLgT&amp;3">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
