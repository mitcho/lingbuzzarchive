It is shown that this view captures the distribution of the process across ex-situ focus constructions, relative clauses and adverbial clauses, which are all contexts involving operator movement. Furthermore, we illustrate that this process is unbounded and applies to each verb in a long-distance dependency. We therefore conclude that this is a reflex of successive-cyclic movement through vP. Additionally, we provide a detailed study of resumption in Asante Twi, showing that despite island-insensitivity, resumption is still derived by movement. Finally, the morpho-phonological side of the phenomenon is investigated. It is shown that overwriting affects only those affixes below v and not those above, which follows from cyclic Vocabulary Insertion. This also provides support for Kandybowicz' (2015) assumption that aspect and negation are lower than vP in Asante Twi.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003765/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003765<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Natural Language and Linguistic Theory</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>tone, successive-cyclic movement, phases, resumption, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003765/v2.pdf">v2 [May 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003765/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2017]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1421 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003765">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003765">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
