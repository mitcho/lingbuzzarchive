We analyze Punjabi 1st/2nd person subjects in the perfective and present evidence that they are neither ergative nor nominative. These DPs (determiner phrases) carry a [+person] feature that must enter into a valuation relation with a head, obeying Béjar and Rezac’s (2003) Person Licensing Condition. This head, μ, we assume, lies between vP and TP (Tense Phrase) and values the raised 1st/2nd DPs as oblique. 3rd person
DPs remain in situ at vP and are ergative case-valued. The theoretical implication is that differential subject marking is a configurational phenomenon. The relative position of the subjects, determined by their person licensing requirements, is crucial to their differential case marking. We also show that Punjabi differential subject marking is independent of differential object marking.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003550/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003550<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Concentric: Studies in Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>person, ergativity, clause structure, punjabi, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>114 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003550">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003550">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
