Due to empirical and methodological difficulties, the issue was left unresolved in the linguistic literature. Independently, however, it was discovered in the 1980s that, contrary to other quantifiers, indefinites may scope out of syntactic islands. We claim that branching readings and the island-escaping behaviour of indefinites are two sides of the same coin: when the latter problem is considered in full generality, a mechanism of ‘functional quantification’ (Winter 2004) must be postulated which is strictly more expressive than Hintikka's, and which predicts that his branching readings are indeed real, although his own solution was insufficiently general. Furthermore, we suggest that, as Hintikka had seen, disjunctions share the behaviour of indefinites, both with respect to island-escaping behaviour and (probably) branching readings. The functional analysis can thus naturally be extended to them.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002585/current.pdf?_s=wXC09-DcSOW3oYGa">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002585<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002585">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002585</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Semantics, 2006, Volume 23, Issue 3</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantics, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>149 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002585?_s=rfMRY7NjWb9aXILg&amp;_k=LMzzhBwkX6gde2wW&amp;2">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002585?_s=rfMRY7NjWb9aXILg&amp;_k=LMzzhBwkX6gde2wW&amp;3">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
