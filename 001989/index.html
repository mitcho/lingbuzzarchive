At the suggestion of course mentor Barbara Partee, as well as several students in the class, I have collected these here and posted them publicly for anyone who may have an interest in either Montague Grammar (MG) generally or the specific papers “Universal Grammar” (UG) and “The Proper Treatment of Quantification in Ordinary English” (PTQ). 
As to the content, structure, and goals of the course, I refer the reader to the course syllabus contained within. I will state briefly, however, that the primary original contribution of these course notes to the already substantial didactic material on MG is its presentation of the algebraic framework of UG, its discussion of the relationship between the UG framework and the system presented in PTQ, and the introductory sections explaining and motivating the development of model-theoretic semantics.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001989/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001989<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>montague grammar, universal grammar, ug, ptq, textbook, course notes, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>867 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001989">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001989">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
