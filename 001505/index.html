Although I will not adopt all the details of the Distributed Morphology framework, I will try to follow the leading idea that morphology is “syntax all the way down” (Marantz 1997). Specifically, I will adhere as far as possible to the Single Engine Hypothesis, the idea that complex morphological objects (i.e. derived words of various kinds) are constructed in the same way as complex syntactic objects, by the iteration of binary (internal or external) Merge. The principal focus here will be on the extent to which head-movement/incorporation (as well as phrasal movement, see Julien 2002 and below) plays a role in constructing complex words, and how FOFC interacts with these processes. Accordingly the main focus will be on inflectional morphology.
	More specifically, the empirical focus will be a striking typological generalisation regarding suffixing morphology, put forward by Hawkins & Gilligan (1988; henceforth H&G): the suffixing preference. This states that OV/postpositional languages show a strong preference for suffixing, while VO/prepositional languages show no preference among suffixation and prefixation. We will suggest an account of this preference which combines FOFC and the Linear Correspondence Axiom (LCA), and look at some of the ramifications of this.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001505/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001505<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Draft of a chapter to appear in Biberauer, Holmberg, Roberts & Sheehan (in progress) The Final-Over-Final Constraint: A Word-Order Universal and its Implications for Linguistic Theory.
