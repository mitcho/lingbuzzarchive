Building on these studies, the current experiment examines its quantitative signatures, typical probabilistic patterns that this framework is predicted to generate Hayes (2020). Given a linear scale of violations of one constraint, MaxEnt yields a sigmoid curve. When another constraint is relevant, this sigmoid curve can be shifted, yielding two sigmoid curves, which together look like a wug, our beloved animal in the linguistics community. When the second constraint can be violated more than once, MaxEnt predicts that it yields a set of multiple sigmoid curves separated from one another, resulting in a "stripy wug-shaped curve." The current experiment demonstrates that we observe a stripy wug-shaped curve in patterns of sound symbolism, systematic associations between sounds and meanings. Concretely, the experiment shows that the judgment of Pokémons' evolution status is cumulatively affected by the mora counts of nonce names, resulting in a sigmoid curve, and that this sigmoid curve can be shifted according to the number of voiced obstruents contained in the names. This paper concludes that MaxEnt HG is a useful framework to model sound-meaning mappings, and suggests that there may be a meaningful parallel between sound symbolic patterns and probabilistic phonological patterns.  <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005476/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005476<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted.
