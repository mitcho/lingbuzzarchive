Building on these studies, the current experiment examines its quantitative signatures, typical probabilistic patterns that this framework is predicted to generate Hayes (2020). Given a linear scale of violations of one constraint, MaxEnt yields a sigmoid curve. When another constraint is relevant, this sigmoid curve can be shifted, yielding two sigmoid curves, which together look like a wug, our beloved animal in the linguistics community. When the second constraint can be violated more than once, MaxEnt predicts that it yields a set of multiple sigmoid curves separated from one another, resulting in a "stripy wug-shaped curve." The current experiment demonstrates that we observe a stripy wug-shaped curve in patterns of sound symbolism, systematic associations between sounds and meanings. Concretely, the experiment shows that the judgment of Pok√©mons' evolution status is cumulatively affected by the mora counts of nonce names, resulting in a sigmoid curve, and that this sigmoid curve can be shifted according to the number of voiced obstruents contained in the names. This paper concludes that MaxEnt HG is a useful framework to model sound-meaning mappings, and suggests that there may be a meaningful parallel between sound symbolic patterns and probabilistic phonological patterns.  <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005476/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005476<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted.
