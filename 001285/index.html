The details may differ, but the formal analyses on floating quantifiers can be divided into three schools of research. One is an adnominal approach, which argues that the noun and the quantifier are externally-merged together (at some point of the derivation), and that the noun has undergone leftward movement in a later derivation (e.g. Kuroda 1983, Sportiche 1988, Ueda 1990, Bošković 2004). Another is an adverbial approach, which claims that the quantifier modifies the event structure of the verb phrase, and that the noun and the quantifier are not related to each other by movement (e.g. Kayne 1975, Fukushima 1991, Bobaljik 1995, 2003, Brisson 1998, Nakanish 2003, Kim and Yang 2006). The other is a hybrid approach (e.g. Ishii 1998, Kang 2002, Ko 2005, 2007, Fitzpatrick 2006) which argues that some floating quantifiers are adnominals while some are adverbials. This paper evaluates the predictions and validity of the three approaches with new experimental data, and provides evidence for the hybrid approach from on-line processing and off-line judgment data.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001285/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001285<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Japanese/Korean Linguistics 19</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>floating quantifiers, scrambling, cyclic linearization, processing, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>561 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001285">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001285">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
