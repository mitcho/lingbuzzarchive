captured as in (1), on the assumption that vowels can bear lexical
accents in underlying representations:
(1) Primary surface word stress falls on the leftmost lexically
accented vowel that is followed by an unaccented vowel or word edge.
If there is no lexical accent in the word, surface stress falls on the
last vowel of the word.
Spruit, Kathman, and Trigo have shown that Dybo's insights can be
derived straightforwardly in Rule-Based Phonology (RBP). In the Halle
& Idsardi 1995 formalism, for example, we can derive the basic Abkhaz
system via the operations in (2).
(2)     i.      Project a right bracket ) for all lexical accents.
        ii.     Line 0 Edge Marking: LLL
        iii.    Clash Deletion:  ) ➝ Ø / _ * ) [iterative, L➝R]
        iv.     Project rightmost element of Line 0 feet to Line 1
        v.      Project leftmost element of Line 1 feet to Line 2
The conflicting directionality identified by Dybo results from Left vs
Right headedness on Lines 0 and 1 respectively (iv, v), and the
iterativity and directionality via iii (cf. Howard 1972).
On the other hand, no version of Optimality Theory currently on the
market is able to account for a system of the Abkhaz type, due to the
ability of the Clash Deletion rule to apply iteratively and
directionally within individual morphemes.
In this talk I present the Abkhaz facts and their analysis in RBP and
the leading variants of OT. I show that the Classic OT tenets of
globalism/parallelism and minimal violation favor outputs which do the
global minimum necessary to avoid stress clash, which harmonically
bound the desired winners with their greater number of clash
deletions. Versions of OT that allow staged computation sensitive to
morphological structure (e.g. Stratal OT or Orgun's Cyclic OT) can
deal with at least a subset of the cases where no more than one
deletion happens per morpheme, but Strata OT fails with forms
involving more than one deletion per stratum and Cyclic OT fails with
forms involving more than one deletion per morpheme. Harmonic
Serialism (and perhaps OT-CC) have the power to generate the desired
outputs, but cannot rule out equally harmonic outputs produced by
derivations that do not apply clash deletion in L→R order.
The problem in brief is that the directionality of clash deletion has
to be built into the process itself, which isn’t allowed in existing
forms of OT, as they do not recognize the existence of processes.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007090/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007090<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Manchester Phonology Meeting</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonology, stress, optimality theory, abkhaz, iterativity, optionality, meeussen's rule, rule-based phonology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>506 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007090">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007090">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
