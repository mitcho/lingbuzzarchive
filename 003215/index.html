It is often thought that when speech is analyzed in tandem with  iconic gestures, 'expressive parity' is regained between speech and sign. But this comparison between sign-with-iconicity and speech-with-gestures turns out to be complex because iconic enrichments often have a non-at-issue status, as attested by their interaction with logical operators. We argue that the status of iconic enrichments is constrained by two parameters: ±internal, ±separate_time_slot.  If an enrichment is effected by the internal modification  of an expression (+internal) – e.g. by lengthening the word loooong in English, or of the sign GROW in ASL – it can have any semantic status and can in particular be at-issue. If an enrichment is an external addition to an expression (-internal) – as is the case of co-speech gestures in English – it does not make an at-issue contribution, but it may have the status of a presupposition or of a supplement. If an enrichment has a separate time slot (+separate_time_slot), it may not be trivial (= presupposed), and must thus be at-issue or supplemental. The generalization is assessed on the basis of vocal iconicity in spoken language, iconic modulations in sign language, co-speech as well as 'post-speech' gestures and facial expressions in spoken and sign language, and also gestures that fully replace words in spoken language. Our typology suggests that there are systematic expressive differences between sign-with-iconicity and speech-with-gestures, and also that the semantic status of iconic enrichments can in part be predicted by parameters pertaining to their form.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003215/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003215<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Natural Language & Linguistic Theory</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sign language, gestures, iconicity, presuppositions, supplements, cosuppositions, co-speech gestures, post-speech gestures, post-speech gestures, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003215/v5.pdf">v5 [December 2017]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003215/v4.pdf">v4 [November 2017]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003215/v3.pdf">v3 [June 2017]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003215/v2.pdf">v2 [December 2016]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/003215/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1328 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003215">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003215">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
