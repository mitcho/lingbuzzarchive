The term has subsequently been extended to cover verbs in other languages with seemingly aberrant voice morphology, and eventually to describe other kinds of perceived mismatches between morphology and syntax. Deponency has therefore become a useful tool for testing and comparing the predictions and assumptions made by different morphological theories, specifically regarding the lexicon-(morpho)syntax interface. However, the different definitions of and theoretical approaches to deponency found in the literature render it difficult to evaluate and compare specific theoretical claims. Definitions that are too broad do not capture a natural class of phenomena, while definitions that are too narrow or explicitly tailored to a specific language obscure potentially valuable cross-linguistic generalizations. Theoretical approaches moreover differ in whether they treat deponency as a property of a designated morphological domain, a purely lexical (diachronically motivated) idiosyncrasy, or an interaction of different synchronic factors. This article uses deponency in Latin as a case study of these issues and discusses the behavior of Latin deponents in finite and non-finite contexts, in primary and secondary verbs, and from various theoretical perspectives. It is shown that the perceived mismatch of deponent verbs in Latin arises from a discrepancy between argument structure and voice morphology in a lexically specified subset of morphologically nonactive/"passive" verbs which unexpectedly have an agent subject, while the vast majority of verbs with this morphology actually displays canonical behavior with respect to argument structure and voice morphology. Future work on deponency in Latin and other languages that display form-function mismatches must therefore disentangle the lexically specific aspects of these phenomena from properties that follow from general morphological or syntactic principles of the language(s) under study.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006525/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006525<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in The Wiley Blackwell Companion to Morphology, eds.
