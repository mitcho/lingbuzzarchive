I also provide arguments against potential alternative analyses based on clefts, resumption, and PF P-drop that would make the Indonesian pattern consistent with the generalization. I propose that this apparently special pattern is naturally accounted for under the recent idea of repair by ellipsis. Specifically, I argue that the failure of percolation of the wh-feature is repaired by deletion in the PF, and provide independent evidence for this analysis from P-stranding under pseudogapping. I also show that P-stranding in French and German cannot be repaired since the violation in question is a syntactic one related to syntactic incorporation. Our investigation suggests a bifurcated view of violations (Boeckx and Lasnik 2006): representational violations pertaining to the syntax-phonology interface can be repaired whereas derivational violations pertaining strictly to the syntactic computation cannot. A much broader implication of our analysis is that syntax is not entirely crash-proof (Frampton and Gutmann 1999, 2002); syntax could make a variety of mistakes, so to speak, whose severity for linguistic computation varies depending on the parametrically defined curve set by a particular language, e.g. incorporation, feature percolation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000966/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000966<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sluicing, p-stranding, pf repair, syntax-phonology interface, percolation, incorporation, phonology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000966/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2009]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1399 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000966">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000966">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
