Non-canonical agreement patterns are found in many of the world's languages and they usually involve person, number, or animacy features.   
Romance varieties do not exhibit unusual agreement patterns, with the exception of a subgroup of dialects spoken in the upper-Southern part of Italy, in the regions of Abruzzo and the lower Marches, where agreement mismatch, as well as agreement displacement-like phenomena, are found. Significantly, in the same area we find person-driven auxiliary selection as well as double-auxiliation constructions. The claim here is that these phenomena are tightly interconnected, and that they are the reflex of a unique factor: the parameterization of an extra φ-Probe, giving origin to a complex v field, which is responsible both for agreement mismatches to arise and for auxiliary selection to be person driven in southern varieties and for subject clitics in northern ones.
