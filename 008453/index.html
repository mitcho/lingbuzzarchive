But, after trying and failing to move this project further forward, I came to realize that extending that book in the same style to cover recent decades was not going to be possible.  Since “Schools” appeared, the discipline has changed (largely but not only as a consequence of the internet) in ways that make the schools-based organization of the earlier book inapplicable today.  Instead I needed to write a sequel, organized on a different principle.
	That sequel has now been published, as “Structural Linguistics in the 21st Century” – see www.cambridgescholars.com/product/978-1-0364-1259-3 .  I give its opening chapter here, as one man’s take on the overall nature of the discipline of linguistics at the present day.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008453/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008453<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cambridge Scholars Publishing</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>history of linguistics, schools of linguistics, syntax, phonology, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/008453/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2024]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>423 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008453">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008453">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
