Contemporary generative theory (e.g., Chomsky, 2019, 2020) has somewhat acknowledged that syntactic operations must apply somewhere, particularly when copying and movement operations are considered: recent work on structure building and mapping (MERGE) makes explicit reference to workspaces. However, it is still a vastly underexplored area. In this paper we explore the concept of workspace and its role in current generative theory, aiming at a precise characterisation of what workspaces are and how their properties determine possible syntactic configurations using tools from topology and graph theory. We analyse the consequences of conceptualising ‘syntax’ as a set of operations that affect local regions of spaces. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005689/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005689<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>July 2021: revisions all throughout.
