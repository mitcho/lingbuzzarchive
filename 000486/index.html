He is orally dysphraxic while otherwise not suffering from any known neurodevelopmental disorder. He lives in North West London and comes from middle class stock, he has a 'posh' phonological system and an advanced vocabulary his mean length of utterance (mlu) is 14 words. Meanwhile, circa 35% of the time, he outputs sentences like: *[well she pretends to be a nice girl but she not, not really, she tells on everyone, she a tell-tale...], and, *[one time I were talking to her about if aliens exist...]. The disparity between George's generally sound cognitive abilities and his linguistic profile are what make him interesting to science. George displays an obviously compartmentalized mind in which some systems are deeply affected while others are normally developing. It is the study of such individuals that provides the strongest proof for the modularity of mind thesis (Fodor 1983) which argues against a holistic architecture of the mind (cf. Genie (Curtiss 1977), Laura (Yamada 1990), Christopher (Smith and Tsimpli 1995) etc.).



George is an important case study because he doesn't seem to fit well into the common linguistically impaired phenotypes, he isn't autistic, retarded or afflicted with Down's Syndrome, also, despite the fact that his speech is erroneous almost exclusively on morpho-syntactic grounds we can not say that he suffers from a classic form of Specific Language Impairment like G-SLI (as

defined by van der Lely 2005, van der Lely and Battell 2003). George's speech circa 65% of the time is grammatical and he outputs well formed wh-questions and embedded clauses infallibly unlike 80% of G-SLI sufferers (ibid.). The fact remains, however, that at (9;11) a boy with a verbal I.Q of 119 should not generate ungrammatical sentences a third of the time. In this short study I

wish to start to unpick George's particular deficits by taking one of his most frequent devious linguistic features and examining it in isolation. The general aim is to try and understand a basic question about George's mind per se: is his linguistic deviance contained within UG and thus a product of non-language specific parameter setting or do his linguistic patterns betray a severely

damaged language faculty.



Section one simply presents George's general cognitive and linguistic patterns and outlines his specific linguistic deficits and argues for an against his diagnosis in a sub-type of SLI (Coltheart ms., van der Lely and Battell 2003). Also, it will be stated that in order to focus I will only look at a particular linguistic deficit: omission of the auxiliary verb 'to be'.



Section two will look at his general distribution of the auxiliary verb 'to be' and extrapolate any relevant patterns.



Section three will then analyse the data showing how it is remarkably similar to L1 acquisition of this auxiliary verb and therefore, possibly, could be explained in similar ways (Schütze ms.). Section three also shows a syntactic consequence of George's auxiliary verb deficit on negation which actually reaffirms research by Zanuttini (1996) on the connection of T and NegPs in

(Romance and) English. 



Finally, we will conclude with the tentative assumption that George's linguistic patterns seem to be captured by UG although whether his deficits are maturational/temporary vs. permanent will only be answered by a longitudinal study.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000486/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000486<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Paper presented at the first Cornell Undergraduate Linguistics Conference, Ithaca NY (2007)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>specific language impairment, sli, auxiliary verb omission, negation, psycholinguistics, universal grammar, language acquisition, connection between negation and tense, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>146 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000486">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000486">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
