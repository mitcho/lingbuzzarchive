According to the hypothesis, a longer duration of nasal vowel is a manifestation, at the level of phonetic implementation, of an underlying bimoraic representation which cause nasal vowels to be longer than oral vowels and also longer than allophonic nasal vowels, whose representation is monomoraic. We recorded three repetitions of 15 words representing five different contexts by speakers of the Belo Horizonte dialect (Southeast Brazil). Analysis by mixed effects models showed that the hypothesis is only borne out in the behavior of [a] before plosive and [i] before fricative. The hypothesis was then recast in terms of moraic primacy: speakers show greater variation in their time of articulation in different segments when such segments are occupied by just one mora. We analyzed the variation in vowel duration for oral and nasal [a, i] when followed by plosive or fricative. Although vowels are longer before plosives than fricatives, this difference was here only attested in oral vowels. This is consistent with the hypothesis that two morae use up more phonological time, thus constraining coarticulatory variation in phonetic timing.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001866/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001866<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Revista Diadorim.
