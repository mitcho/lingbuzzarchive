Here I extend the discussion so as to take into account critical remarks in Recanati (2007) and Morgan (ms. 2009), and to explain how I see the account going within a modal conception of the nature of (structured) propositions.  On the linguistic side, I am specifically critical of the view that human languages with first-personal or other indexicals that are sensitive to embedding involve "context shift" in the sense of Schlenker (2003) or Anand (2006), rather than being special cases of anaphora.  Departing also from Lewis (1979), whose internalist views did not permit a robust sense of de re thought, I argue for an account that rules out context shift; pins the de se on reflexivity of content; and restores de re content along standard proof-theoretic lines, as in Hintikka (1962).  Finally, using examples from English and Norwegian, I observe (with Casta√±eda (1987), I believe)  that the distinction between truly de se and merely de re thoughts about oneself extends to certain extensional as well as intensional simple sentences, where the question of context shift evidently cannot arise, but where the distinction between reflexive and non-reflexive thoughts can be made out in logical form.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000915/current.doc">doc</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000915<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Recanati et al.
