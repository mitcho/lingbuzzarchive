The usual approach assumes that the elided TP in (1) is as in (2), where the interrogative CP consists of a Wh-question version of the antecedent:

(1) Jack ate something, but I don't know what. 
(2) Jack ate something, but I don’t know what-i [TP Jack ate t-i ].

Such a view is consistent with the notion that ellipsis is subject to some form of syntactic identity condition (perhaps alongside a semantic one; cf. e.g. Chung 2013 for discussion). Nonetheless, alongside the possibility in (2), a growing body of work shows that the elided TP may be a cleft, departing more radically from the structure of the antecedent; a possibility dubbed pseudosluicing in Merchant (1998). 

(3) Jack ate something, but I don’t know what-i [TP it was t-i ]. 

Merchant (2001) provides 10 empirical arguments aimed at showing that all sluicing cannot be reduced to pseudosluicing. Merchant’s diagnostics are designed to rule out a pseudosluice source in a variety of contexts. In this paper, I present a new diagnostic which rules out the non-pseudosluice source, providing further support for the existence of pseudosluicing.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001761/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001761<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>MS Rutgers University, presented at NELS 43</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sluicing, ellipsis, pseudosluicing, cleft, identity, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>478 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001761">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001761">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
