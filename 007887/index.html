This paper explores a lesser-studied variant of PI involving agent arguments, which requires a surface word order that reverses the universal thematic hierarchy. This reversal raises questions about its impact on two cross- linguistic reflections of transitive syntax: accusative case and φ-agreement with objects. Through an empirical investigation of Turkish and Laz, we demonstrate that the case and agreement patterns in clauses with agent PI are identical to those where the agent is not incorporated. Given the view that the incorporated agent is merged lower than the theme argument (Öztürk 2005, 2009), an explanation is needed for this parallelism. To address this, we propose a general architecture that models the syntactic and semantic properties of PI. Drawing on dependent theoretic accounts of accusative case in Turkish (Baker and Vinokurova 2010) and object agreement in Laz (Bondarenko and Zompì 2023), we postulate a null expletive subject in clauses with agent PI. Our analysis builds a two-layered verbal structure based on the semantics of PI proposed in Sağ (2022, 2024), where PI occurs at the level of event kinds (VP-internally) and canonical argumentation at the level of event tokens (VP-externally). Extending the expletive analysis to theme PI, we position the null expletive as a semantically contentful ‘placeholder’ within the event token domain, substituting for the incorporated argument of the event kind. Anchored as a pivotal connection between the two layers of the event domain, the expletive ensures the dependencies required for case and φ-agreement outputs.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007887/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007887<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under review in NLLT</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>(agent) pseudo-incorporation · event kinds · event tokens · two-layered argument structure · dependent case · dependent φ-agreement, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007887/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2024]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>409 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007887">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007887">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
