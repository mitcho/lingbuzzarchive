Though only occasionally directly compared, both have been analyzed as cases where T bears a formally uninterpretable tense feature that must be licensed by a higher counterpart. This paper, however, focuses on differences between the two environments, particularly in their interaction with aspect, and argues that these differences suggest that sequence of tense and counterfactuals cannot both be analyzed in terms of feature licensing. I conclude that of the two, only counterfactuals involve true ``fake'' past (i.e. syntactically licensed [uPAST]), while sequence of tense is better accounted for in other terms.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002461/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002461<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002461">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002461</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>counterfactuals, sequence of tense, inflection, features, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1483 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002461">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002461">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
