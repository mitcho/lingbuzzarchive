It is equally well known that a sentence with a plural noun like Mike washed windows gives rise to a so-called ‘multiplicity’ inference that Mike washed more than one window. This inference however disappears under negation: Mike didn’t wash windows conveys that Mike didn’t wash any window, not that he didn’t wash more than one window (Krifka 1989, Sauerland et al. 2005b a.o.). In this paper, we focus on the interaction between these two inferences in sentences containing both an adverbial modifier and a plural noun under negation, like This morning, Mike didn’t wash windows with soap. We observe that this sentence has a reading conveying that this morning, Mike didn’t wash any window with soap but that he did wash multiple windows (albeit not with soap). In other words, the multiplicity inference seems to arise on top of the inference of the adverbial modifier. As we discuss, this reading is not predicted by any version of the (otherwise pretty successful) implicature approach to the multiplicity inference (Sauerland et al. 2005b, Spector 2007, Mayr 2015 a.o.) in combination with the implicature treatment of the inference of adverbial modifiers (Katzir 2007 a.o.). We sketch two solutions for this problem. The first keeps the implicature approach to the multiplicity inference but treats the inference of adverbial modifiers as a presupposition, building on proposals by Simons (2001) and Schlenker (2008). In addition, it adopts the idea that presuppositions can be strengthened via implicatures, as proposed by Spector & Sudo (2017). The second solution keeps instead the implicature approach to adverbial modifiers but adopts a non-implicature approach to multiplicity, the recent homogeneity-based proposal by Križ (2017). Either way, the interaction between multiplicity and the inference of adverbial modifiers suggests that we cannot treat both as implicatures: if we want to treat either one as an implicature, we need to do something different for the other. We end the paper discussing related issues, and comparing the case above to analogous cases involving different scalar inferences. Finally, we briefly show that the alternative non-implicature ambiguity approach to the multiplicity inference (Farkas & de Swart 2010, Marti 2017 a.o.) doesn’t, as it stands, provide a solution to our problem.
