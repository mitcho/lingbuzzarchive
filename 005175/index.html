Collins</a><br/>May 2020</center>&nbsp;<p></p>This paper proposes an account of neg-raising inferences, according to which NR-predicates
encode an excluded middle inference as part of their not-at-issue content. This sort of analysis was originally proposed by Gajewski 2005, 2007. Though where Gajewski analyzes NR-predicates as triggering a soft presupposition of opinionatedness, I argue that the presupposition is better understood as being automatically accommodated.

Furnished with a formal notion of automatically accommodated presupposition, I show how this analysis correctly predicts that the opinionatedness presupposition fails to project past quantificational subjects, as well as modal operators. This is argued to be a prediction of any account of presupposition accommodation which bans any accommodation leading to un-binding of bound variables. I showed how this account has several empirical advantages
over competing presuppositional accounts, especially with regards to quantificational sentences.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005175/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005175<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted to Journal of Semantics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>neg-raising, presupposition, accommodation, drt, dynamic semantics, negation, quantifiers, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>294 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005175">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005175">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
