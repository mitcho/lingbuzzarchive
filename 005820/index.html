The semantic contribution of active v is to introduce an event of causation and an external argument (the Agent), cf. i.a. Folli and Harley (2004), Ramchand (2006). A  natural extension to the passive would be a v which also introduces an event but with an existentially closed Agent. However, under this straightforward analysis nothing prevents passive morphology (the passive v) from attaching to unaccusative verbs, e.g. like English 'fall', as is pointed out in Ramchand (2006:81). In English it is clearly unavailable. This means that either English is an out-lier, or the straightforward analysis is wrong for passives in general. In this paper I argue that Buryat (Mongolic) provides one instance of exactly such a v-like passive morpheme: it attaches to unaccusatives. Since such cases have been attested elsewhere, cf. Lyutikova et al. (2006) for Karachay-Balkar (Turkic), the straightforward analysis seems to be on the right track, at least for some languages.

In addition, I show that Buryat clearly showcases a particular problem for any v-analysis. Specifically: v accounts wrongly predict the ungrammatical 'soup ate' to be acceptable. Nothing in the standard picture makes an active (or passive) v obligatory in the context of a VP 'soup ate'. I argue that this problem can be solved with a presuppositional analysis of v and the principle of Maximize Presupposition coming from Heim (1991).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005820/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005820<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of WAFL14</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>argument structure, passive, little v, maximize presupposition, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005820/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>304 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005820">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005820">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
