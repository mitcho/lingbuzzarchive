I draw a systematic comparison between that2 and que2 and present a host of similarities in terms of the syntactic behavior and distribution of secondary complementizers in the two languages. Thus, I argue for a unified analysis of recomplementation in English and Spanish within Rizzi’s (1997 et seq.) split-CP hypothesis wherein the flanked dislocate occupies the specifier of TopicP, whose head is spelled out as that2/que2. I therefore show that the structures of the peripheries of English and Spanish are not as different as they may appear to be at first sight. I also note several asymmetries between the two languages in terms of the interaction between recomplementation patterns and other constructions, and submit that these differences can be ascribed to independent factors: they are due to lexico-semantic and syntactic differences displayed by the two languages, but not to a different underlying left- peripheral architecture. The paper also investigates the reason(s) why secondary thats/ques are lexically realized and argues for the polyvalent nature of such iterative complementizers. I further propose that one of their functions is to mark discourse. The findings reported here also have far-reaching consequences for the contentious derivation of preposed topical phrases (merge or move?) in the syntax of English and Spanish (including adjunct clauses), as well as ramifications to other existing debates.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004618/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004618<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Glossa</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>cllt, htld, locality of movement, left periphery, discourse markers, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>138 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004618">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004618">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
