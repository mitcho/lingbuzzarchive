     I propose that locative Ps are the modifiers of a non-phonologically realized noun, Place, whose presence gives locatives a nominal flavor and contributes their lexical make up.  What appears to be the ground argument of the locative is the possessor of Place.  Place denotes the physical space surrounding the reference landmark (i.e., what is considered the ground argument of the locative).  I demonstrate that this space becomes more narrow when Place is modified by the locative, while it remains less precise when a locative modifier of Place is missing.  

     I further claim that the DP containing Place is the complement of a functional head, PLoc, and the latter is what contributes the functional make up of locatives, hence, explains their overall oscillating status along the functional/lexical dimension.  

     My claims are initially based on evidence from Greek, but I demonstrate that they readily accommodate the behavior of Spanish and English locatives.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000550/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000550<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000550">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000550</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in: G.
