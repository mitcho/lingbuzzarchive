It has to find a place in syntax, while exercising its meaning on the proper part of the utterance that it bears on. Treating hell as a predicate targeting a Cause argument, the cause responsible for its utterance, and formally representing in the structure elements that contribute to its interpretation, such as the utterance situation, the hearer and the speaker, may yield a derivation that accounts for its interpretation. As a result of its syntactic position, in one construction, in which the hell is the specifier of a selected predicate, it takes the utterance situation as its Cause argument and in the other construction, which is a complex particle verb, it takes the event.
	The insertion of the hell in the syntax reveals a number of important facts, such as the difference between complex transitive structures and ECM-structures, it begs for the proper treatment of resultative constructions, and of fake object resultatives, and it points to the crucial relevance of selection for a predicate. Moreover, it requires questioning the argumental status of emotionally loaded DPs (scare the living daylights out of), with the role of the use of slang an important element in that question. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003476/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003476<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>in Relations, connexions, dépendances : hommage au professeur Claude Guimier.
