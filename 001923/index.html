Specifically, I will focus on the question of how these factors relate to the perceived novelty or "markedness" of newly formed compounds. For the analysis, we will concentrate on novel adjective-noun compounds, e.g., 'Blauschachtel' ('blue_box'), 'Schmalmesser' ('slim_knife') etc., with occasional glances at noun-noun compounds where relevant. We will start from a lexicalist perspective and the conventional assumption that, in German, word-formation is the preferred route for establishing a concept's name, put this assumption to several tests and prove it to be correct. In the second part of the paper, I will argue that a systematic relation holds between the markedness of an A-N compound and its interpretation as a kind name as well as its affinity to be lexicalized. Crucially, this relationship will be traced back to a pragmatic principle, which holds that deviance from a conventionalized form (that is, in our case, from a phrasal expression like 'schmales Messer' ('slim knife') implies deviance from the meaning of this form – which, in turn, results in a re-interpretation as a kind name and in semantic specialization. Consequently, interpretation as kind name and semantic specialization in compounds will be characterized as the cause for potential lexicalization and not as its effect, as is often proposed in the literature. Some remarks about the compatibility of the proposed analysis to alternative, non-rule-based approaches (e.g., Construction Grammar) will conclude my paper.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001923/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001923<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Claudia Brinker-von der Heyde, Nina Kalwa, Nina-Maria Klug, Paul Reszke (eds.)
