In English, Chomsky (2013) proposes that the label of {DP, vP} = XP in (1a) is determined as vP, since the DP internally merges with TP, rendering the lower copy invisible from LA. Another {XP, YP} problem arises when the DP merges TP in (1b). The label of YP is determined as <φ, φ> via feature-sharing (Agree) between the DP and T(P). In languages with φ-agreement, the strategy in (1b) is available. Then, what would the label of YP in φ-featureless languages like Japanese (Fukui 1986) be like? This is the central question the current study deals with.
(1) a. {xp DP, {vP v ,{VP … }}}: XP = vP (Labeling via Internal Merge)
     b. {xp DP, {TP T, {vP DP, vP}}}: YP = <φ, φ> (Labeling via feature-sharing)
I propose that the timing and domain of Transfer is much more flexible in Japanese than in
English due to the lack of its unvalued formal features. Combining the Labeling via Transfer (Takita et al. 2016) and the insight of Fukui and Kasai (2004), I will show how the current proposal explains the labeling problems in structure building, multiple nominative, and scrambling constructions, all of which involve {XP, YP} structures in Japanese. Let us first review the previous studies in section 2, and then move to the proposal and its consequences in section 3<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003581/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003581<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Proceedings of WAFL 13</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>labeling algorithm, transfer, multiple nominatives, scrambling, japanese, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>419 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003581">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003581">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
