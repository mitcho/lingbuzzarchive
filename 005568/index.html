I will argue that PRO lacks the presuppositional features of lexical pronouns that a) discriminate their antecedent and b) determine their phonological make-up.  In particular, I will argue that control breaks down into  a number of dependence relations among which a semantic relation that involves the s-selection of a C-head with a specified [participant] feature (+/- author) and a binding relation between the dedicated controller and PRO in cases of exhaustive obligatory control. Furthermore, I will present evidence that PRO is case-licensed by infinitival Tense and explicate the semantic relation between Tense and PRO that underlies thiscCase assignment.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005568/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005568<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Venice, Italy</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>raising, control, pro, presuppositional approach to (pro)nominal reference, situation-based nominals, tense as a predicate relating situations, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>343 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005568">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005568">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
