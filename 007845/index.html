The book presents a unified semantic theory of expressions involving the notions of part and whole. It develops a theory of part structures which differs from traditional extensional mereological theories in that the notion of an integrated whole plays a central role and in that the part structure of an entity is allowed to vary across different situations, perspectives, and dimensions. 
The notion of an integrated whole includes that of a maximally self-connected entity, and thus the theory includes what has been called a 'mereotopological theory' (e.g. Grimm).
The content of the mass-count distinction is given in terms of the notion of an integrated whole relative to a situation, which is, roughly, the intensional correlate of a contextually given set in various recent theories of the mass-count distinction (e.g. Rothstein).

The book gives specific motivations for the situatedness of part structures relevant in the semantics of natural language: part-structure-semantic selection and distributivity, part-structure-sensitive perspective shifters ('whole', adnominal 'individual') and quantifiers involving a metric specification of part structures (e.g. 'several times').

This theory of situated part structures anticipates various current theoretical developments; a good part of the empirical data have not as yet received an alternative analysis.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007845/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007845<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Oxford University Press</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>mereology, integrated whole, collective nouns, mass-count distinction, part-structure-sensitive perspective shifters, semantic selection, event quantifiers, frequency adverbials, distributivity, perspective shifters, as-phrases, multidimensional part structures semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007845/v3.pdf">v3 [March 2024]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/007845/v2.pdf">v2 [February 2024]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/007845/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2024]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>827 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007845">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007845">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
