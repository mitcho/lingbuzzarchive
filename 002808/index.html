Does the exclusion of linguistic intention and action from generative rules introduce artefactitious complexity and preclude the strongest possible natural constraints on characterizations of the human faculty of language?  

Does the inclusion of intention in linguistic rules both enable solutions of otherwise intractable problems and otherwise enable a wider set of more generalized and more naturalistic solutions?

Does theorizing based on linguistic intent lead to thinner, simplified, more directly empirical argumentation compared to the indirections necessitated by complex syntactic analysis based on central configurational syntax? 

Does the inclusion of linguistic intent in generative rules motivate the processes of Merge and Move as the essence of human language syntax? 

Are there alternate paths to explanatory theories beyond Chomksy’s programmatic axioms? We propose and motivate Tool Grammar, in which a sentence is an action, a performance wherein intention is central rather than syntax.  Each tool is an intentional device for specific effect in the process of utterance generation, distinguished from the traditional concept of a linguistic ‘rule’ by the explicit specification of intent added to the standard structural input and output conditions. The data essential for motivating linguistic descriptions is thus enhanced by explicit field transcriptions of evident user action and intent using a controlled scientific vocabulary.  Tool Grammar (TG) postulates that sentence generation exhibits linguistic cognitive actions most fundamentally and syntax processes more procedurally, parallel to but distinguished from the Chomskyan hypothesis that humans are fundamentally “syntactical animals”. (Searle, June 29, 1972)  The crux of resolution for this contrast is whether TG better can enable stronger constraints on the definition of human language than more rigidly syntax-centered accounts. 
We present and defend empirically transparent and radically penetrating mechanisms for constraining the notion of a human language in support of the primary Chomskyan goal of explaining infinite linguistic creativity from finite resources and rapid child language learning in the context of poverty of stimulus data.


Language has the external representation of meaning as a purpose and tools as a means of action.    Natural constraints on the inter-compatibility of tools render many rules and constraints on configurational syntax unnecessary, since unacceptable sentences often reflect the incompatible misapplication of tools.  A vast swath of linguistic ill-formedness can be attributed to structures involving incompatible intents. When syntactic phenomena are understood to be conditioned by linguistic action/intent descriptors, difficult problems yield to straightforward solutions: conflicting intents yield ill-formed sentences. When generalizations are sought at an incorrect and incapable level of representation, unnatural and unnecessarily contrived solutions unavoidably result.  By incorporating intention action directives into linguistic structure building, syntactic problems generally acquire a facilitative pragmatic resolution: much of syntax is transformed into utilitarian cognitive pragmatics.    Important fundamentals of syntax are reducible to a particular form of cognitive pragmatics and syntax is no longer so autonomous a component of linguistic competence.   Much of the Chomskyan Weltanshaung and the resulting theories can be retained and revalidated, but much also is to be gained by refactoring the work product of linguistic science.

TG represents a sub-paradigmatic shift in syntactic theory to the extent it can be integrated to the generative program.  Important Chomskyan tenets are revised but significant elements are retained. Poverty of stimulus, universals, ill-formedness, recursiveness, interpretation, generative capacity, filtering, and so forth are reinterpreted in an alternative architecture of linguistic competence.  Our arguments are launched by considering a range of critical issues in theoretical syntax plus a set of difficult unresolved problems.

The following examples provide a taste of how the intention of the passive tool can conflict with the intentions of other tools:  the passive structure, drawing attention away from the agent, is vulnerable to conflict from a tool centering on the agent.

Al visited the sick woman.
The sick woman was visited by Al.
What was surprising about Al was that he visited the sick woman.
*What was surprising about Al was that the sick woman was visited by Al (him).

We observe incompatibility between tools in opposition, at cross purposes, to both add and take away special attention to the agent.  This is a tip-of-the-iceberg example of issues that can be handled in a straightforward way if intention is represented in linguistic rules.  When this approach is extended to many other areas of syntax, attractive and simplified solutions become available for a surprisingly wide range of problems.  This paper presents a range of arguments from linguistic and poetic data that action intents are of the essence in a set of syntactic processes.  When the intentions underlying structural decisions are examined, separate from the internals of syntax, semantics and pragmatics, all three maybe simplified, potentially increasing the constraints on what it is to be a human language.

The operative hypothesess of this paper include whether linguistic rules must include linguistic structural intentions, a theoretical position that has not heretofore been fully examined. From a preponderance of diverse cases involving linguistic problems that resist authoritative solutions, we demonstrate that optimal linguistic theory is inclined toward incorporation of components of linguistic action and intention.  We present a set of problems in  linguistic theory that require the dimension of structural intent for fully empircal solutions to emerge given that intentions are undeniable in the epistemology of language.  The absence of this level of representation in syntactic theory is seen to account for difficulties in advancing the theory in linear progress toward more comprehensive coverage.

We conclude that the exclusion of linguistic intention and action from generative rules introduces artefactitious complexity and undesirably prcludes the strongest possible natural constraints on characterizations of the human faculty of language.  The inclusion of intention in linguistic rules both enables solutions of otherwise intractable problems and enables simpler, more naturalistic solutions generally. Theorizing based on linguistic intent leads to thinner, simplified, more directly empirical argumentation compared to the indirections necessitated by complex syntactic analysis based on central configurational syntax. The inclusion of linguistic intent in generative rules points toward the processes of Merge and Move as the essence of human language synax?<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002808/current.pdf">pdf</a> ][ <a href="/lingbuzz/002808/current.file">file</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002808<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002808">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002808</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Massachusetts</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, principles and parameters, generative syntax, pragmatics, cogntitive syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002808/v2.pdf">v2 [January 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002808/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>135 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002808">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002808">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
