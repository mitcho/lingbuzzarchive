This paper is a case study of the imperative clause type and its relation to other clause types in Swedish and German in a modular framework. We will argue that there are three independent clause types, the finite, the imperative and the infinitive clause type, the differences between them derived from a morphologically founded distinction between three verbal paradigms, the finite, the imperative and the infinitive one. 
		We will further show how the three basic clause types are built up by three autonomous and interdependent modular systems, the morpho-syntactic, the semantic and the speech act system. Whereas the morpho-syntactic system operates with valued and unvalued features of various kinds, like [finite] and [Ï†], the semantic system supplies modal operators, that will provide the clause type with a clause type meaning. The speech act system will turn the clause type with its clause type meaning into a speech act, being the act the speaker performs, when uttering a clause. Not until the clause is accepted as a proper speech act at the speech act interface, will it become speech.
	Like in Platzack & Rosengren (1998), we also once more claim, that the imperative clause type lacks TP, which in turn prevents it from getting a subject and embed. 
	Because of its non-finite, i.e. imperative head, the imperative clause will be a clause type in the system of clause types right from the morphological beginning. It differs substantially in its syntactic structure from the finite clause as well as from the infinitive clause, being a clause type with a head with only a 2nd person inflection. This difference results in a slim structure, univocal meaning and a restricted area of application, the speaker uttering it in order to make or allow the addressee to act according to a norm. It can hence only be used to talk TO the addressee, not ABOUT him.
