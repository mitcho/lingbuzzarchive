This paper goes a step further, making an aspect of this idea more concrete by identifying a shared morpheme, German d-. But more importantly, and here lies the focus of the paper, it extends the parallelism to include the adjectival domain. The morpheme d- is argued to spell out a certain left peripheral head indiscriminately of the nature of the lexical category head of its containing extended projection, i.e. across V, N, and A.



The study discusses primarily two grammatical alternations in Germanic. The first is that between a low and a left peripheral (V2) position of the finite verb. The second is that between definite (weak) and indefinite (strong) adjectival agreement. I argue that the two alternations are instantiations of the same underlying dichotomy, and therefore must receive analogous analyses. Notably, given that verb placement is derived by syntactic movement, sensitive to the presence of a complementizer, the adjectival inflection alternation is also analyzed as derived by syntactic movement, and is also shown to be sensitive to the presence of a ``complementizer.''



The generalization that ensues from adjectival, verbal, nominal, comparative, and historical considerations, is that there is a left peripheral head, F, in Germanic which  either attracts a low category, containing the lexical category-head of the extended projection (the verb, the adjective, or the noun), or is realized as d-. This proposal is strongly supported by the typological generalization within Germanic that embedded V2 in the presence of an overt complementizer is readily available exactly in those languages whose complementizer is not a d-word.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001030/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001030<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>germanic - verb second - adjectival agreement - complementizer - definite article - extended projection  - syntax/morphology, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>677 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001030">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001030">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
