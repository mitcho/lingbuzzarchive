However, Marusic et al. (2007), van Koppen (2007), Bhatt and Walkow (2013), among others reveal that CA interacts with linear order; hence, prominence is not a factor. In addition, previous work does not plausibly account for all peculiarities of CA in Arabic: (i) CA is an instance of partial agreement that is not specific to coordination,(ii) CA is always singular, (iii) CA is optional in non-standard varieties, and (iv) CA (and partial agreement in VSO in general) is full (all phi features) agreement when the first conjunct is a pronoun. I argue here that CA in Arabic is an illusion; CA (in the sense that a verb agrees with the first conjunct) does not exist in Arabic. My
analysis is couched in terms of left to right structure building (Phillips, 1996;2003; Bruening,2014), and others). A major finding is that true CA occurs only when both the first and the last conjuncts control agreement as in Hindi (Bhatt and Walkow, 2013).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003250/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003250<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>closest conjunct agreement, conjunct agreement, coordination, linear order, little pro</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003250/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>750 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003250">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003250">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
