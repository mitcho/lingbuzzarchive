Thus 'John[i] likes him[i]' would  in standard semantic theories yield a perfectly acceptable interpretation; it is only because of Condition B that the sentence is deviant on its coreferential reading. We explore an alternative in which some binding-theoretic principles (esp. Condition C, Condition B, a modified version of the Locality of Variable Binding argued for in Kehler 1993 and Fox 2000, and Weak and Strong Crossover) follow from the interpretive procedure - albeit a somewhat non-standard one. In a nutshell, these principles are taken to reflect the way in which sequences of evaluation are constructed in the course of the interpretation of a sentence. The bulk of the work is done by a principle of Non-Redundancy, which prevents any object from appearing twice in any given sequence of evaluation. The analysis includes an account of anaphora with split antecedents and disjoint reference effects.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000215/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000215<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Natural Language Semantics 13, 1: 1-92, 2005</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>binding, anaphora, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>97 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000215">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000215">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
