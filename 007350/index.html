As this book shows, in the field of second language (L2) learning, the benefit goes in both directions. Starting with the title, an often neglected question that readers might ask is: Why haven’t we seen a title (not even, as of this writing, of an article listed in Google) on approaches to “Instructed First Language (L1) Acquisition”? As we will see, the reason that researchers and practitioners offer will differ, starting from what appears, and is in fact, a fundamental theoretical difference in the broader field of linguistics. But, just as the author might agree, research findings from the study of Second Language Acquisition (SLA) present us with a special opportunity to discuss findings as they are related to the controversy. From both the laboratory and from the classroom, and from the point of view of two clearly divergent theories of language acquisition, the opportunity has appeared for a productive dialogue.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007350/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007350<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Issues in Applied Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>second language acquisition, universal grammar, full transfer/full access, usage-based, first language acquisition, poverty of stimulus problem, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>153 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007350">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007350">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
