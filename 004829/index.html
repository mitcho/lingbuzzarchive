The paper focuses on the complementizer tenine (an action nominalization of SAY), which is used with communicative reception verbs (‘hear’, ‘read’, etc.), in a dialect of Chuvash (Turkic). The main puzzle concerns the difference between tenine and the more general complementizer teze (the same-subject converb of SAY) with respect to the controller of shifted first person (namely, teze, but not tenine, disallows non-subject controllers). An account of this restriction based on three independent language-specific constraints is offered. An alternative account is discussed whereby tenine (and teze) are synchronically non-finite forms of SAY. The findings highlight the importance of the form of the complementizer as well as of the choice of controller for shifted 1st person in SAY-based complementation and extend the typological parameters of indexical shift.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004829/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004829<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Accepted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>turkic, say-complementizers, verbs of hearing, indexical shift, shifted agreement, action nominalizations</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004829/v2.pdf">v2 [July 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004829/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>551 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004829">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004829">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
