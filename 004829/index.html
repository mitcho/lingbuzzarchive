This leaves the status of particular forms as syntactically decomposable uncertain. I explore this issue with reference to the distribution of the two instances of non-canonical SAY in Poshkart Chuvash (its converb teze, used with verbs of speech and thought, and its participial nominalization tenine, used with verbs of hearing). Focusing on complements with indexical shift, I show that teze and tenine differ in the choice of the “controller” for the shifted first person. I explore and reject a decompositional account of this pattern, arguing that the controller must be directly encoded as part of the construction, suggesting that “verb vs. complementizer” might be a false dichotomy.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004829/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004829<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>turkic, verbs of saying, complementizer, indexical shift, constructionist approaches, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>69 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004829">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004829">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
