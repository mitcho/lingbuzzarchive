This paper discusses the complementizer tenine in a dialect of Chuvash (Turkic), an action nominalization of SAY, used with verbs of hearing and existing alongside the general complementizer teze, based on the same-subject converb. The main puzzle concerns the differences between teze and tenine related to the controller of shifted first person (teze is disallowed with verbs of hearing, but only in shifted complements). An account of this restriction based on three constraints on shifted first person, teze-clauses and SAY-complements is offered. An alternative account whereby tenine is (synchronically) a nominalization is discussed. The findings highlight the importance of the form of the complementizer and the choice of the controller of shifted 1st person in SAY-based complementation and extend the typological parameters of indexical shift.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004829/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004829<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>turkic, say-complementizers, verbs of hearing, indexical shift, shifted agreement, action nominalizations</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004829/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>197 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004829">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004829">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
