It is argued that the landing site of subject wh-movement (who in who left) is lower than non-subject wh-movement (who in who did Mary leave) but higher than regular subjects (Mary in Mary left). Quirky subjects are argued to be lower than regular agreeing subjects, with a generalization proposed regarding their crosslinguistic availability. The overall account is extended to a number of other cases, including Germanic V-2 subjects, languages with subject only relativization strategies, only subjects, Defaka focus movement and Bùlì wh-movement, Norwegian C-marking, Brazilian Portuguese nunca ellipsis, Hong Kong Sign Language rightward wh-movement, overt imperative subjects, clausal subjects, locative inversion, there constructions, Singlish non-agreeing subjects, Japanese and Chinese subjects. Regarding the EPP, the paper argues for a contextual approach to the EPP where, on a par with a contextual approach to phases, there is an EPP domain, with the highest projection in the EPP domain being the locus of the EPP effect (on a par with the highest projection in a phasal domain being a phase). The contextual conception of the EPP is put into a broader perspective regarding a more general theoretical move toward contextuality in syntax, which permeates many domains and which argues against regarding syntax as fully Markovian in nature<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007130/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007130<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms. University of Connecticut</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>epp, split ip, contextuality, wh-movement, quirky subjects, a/a’ distinction, phases, agreement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1059 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007130">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007130">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
