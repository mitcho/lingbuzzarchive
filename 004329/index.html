On its ‘individuated’ reading ("the old are generally happier"), this construction seems to refer to old individuals; on its ‘mass’ reading ("the old is never ordinary"), to something like oldness. Empirically, this paper uses naturally- occurring data to show that both readings are more productive than sometimes suggested. Theoretically, the two readings are parsimoniously derived by existentially closing off one or the other of the two arguments (the individual argument x, the state argument s) made available by the state analysis – λxλs[old(s) ∧ holder(x,s)] – deriving a predicate of individuals for the individuated reading, and a predicate of states for the mass reading. This account of Determiner + Adjective further reflects the philosophical idea that properties can be construed as predicates of individuals or as the abstract thing that those individuals share; and connects to other ways of nominalizing both verb phrases and adjectives.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004329/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004329<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Glossa</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>adjectives, states, event semantics, properties, nominalization, lexical semantics, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>264 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004329">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004329">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
