Often explanations of empirical phenomena switch from using the terms of one to explain problems for the other. This article makes such a contribution, explaining an outstanding problem for well-established economy conditions  namely, Last Resort do-insertion  partly in terms of an independently attested locality constraint, Attract Closest. Specifically the article argues that do-support involves movement of v, and that syntactic locality constraints and morphological conditions on the pronunciation of do conspire to provide do-supports apparently Last Resort nature. Evidence comes from the construction known as British do; I show that evidence for separating this construction from standard do-support is not compelling, and instead motivate a reanalysis of do-support with the attempt to give standard do-support and British do (and its quirks) a unified explanation. In doing so the article dispenses with the problematic violation of Inclusiveness that comes with standard Last Resort accounts of do-support, and it provides a solution for other empirical problems along the way.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001198/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001198<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>verb movement, do-support, british do, locality, economy, last resort, attract closest, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>845 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001198">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001198">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
