Nouns have intrinsically valued uGen(der), and items that agree with them have unvalued uGen. Hence the paper adopts the proposal of Pesetsky & Torrego (2007) that unvalued and uninterpretable should not be biconditionally related. On the other hand, it rejects the thesis of radical interpretability of Brody (1997) that is argued for in Pesetsky & Torrego (2001, 2007) and Ziejlstra (2012). See also Boskovic (to appear) for independent arguments that gender is uninterpretable, even as a feature of nouns.  

The paper goes on to argue that uGen of of N fulfills the "active goal" requirement that makes an expression Y a licit participant in Agree (X,Y). But because the uGen feature of N does not get its value in Agree (X,Y) it is not "deactivated" by Agree and can continue to function as an activity feature in successive Agree relations. This makes possible concord on multiple items within DP, taking the same noun as goal. In Bantu languages, where N systematically adjoins to D, N’s valued uGen is uniformly accessible to clause-level probes making possible concord-like iterating agreement at the clause level because DPs remain “active”. 

In contrast, uCase of a DP obtains its value in Agree (X,Y). The paper argues that this makes it impossible for Y = uCase to participate in further Agree relations since they would lead to unclarity at PF regarding how Y should be pronounced, leading to the "deactivated/frozen in place" property of Case-valued expressions in the system of Chomsky (2000, 2001). While Bejar & Massam (1999) have argued convincingly that this is not a universal property -- revaluation of Case is possible in some languages -- nonetheless I think that for the languages I considered in this paper, the conclusions are valid.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001436/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001436<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Putnam, M.
