Salmon (1997), Liebesman (2015, 2016, Forthcoming), and Haida and Trinh (2021) argue against this traditional account, claiming that it can’t explain our use of expressions like two and a half novels. According to them, the proper analysis of such expressions requires a partiality measure, which maps entities to rational numbers such as 2.5. In this paper, we set out to defend the traditional account. To do so, we demonstrate that an analysis based on a partiality measure is inconsistent with the truth conditions of plural comparatives and equatives. We also show that such an account doesn’t provide an adequate analysis for expressions like two novels and a half, nor for their French counterparts (e.g., deux romans et demi). Critically, such expressions contain no constituent that could refer to the number 2.5. We provide an alternative analysis for all these expressions, based on cardinality and an operation of non-overlapping summation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008214/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008214<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistics and Philosophy (daft of article to appear)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>count nouns; counting; fractions; measure functions; cardinality; plurals, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>186 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008214">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008214">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
