the nominal it associates with (The cookies will all have been eaten up by
then!). The phenomenon has received two major analyses: stranding and
adjunction. The stranding analysis argues that the associate moves leftward
out of a complex constituent that contains both it and the floating
quantifier. The adjunction analysis considers floating quantifiers to be
adverbial adjuncts. This paper investigates Q-float in Arabic and shows
that neither of the existing accounts perfectly captures the facts. Adopting
Ott’s (2012; 2015) analysis of split topics and Q-float in German, the
paper proposes that in Arabic, a floating quantifier and its associate are
merged together in a particular syntactic position as a set of autonomous
phrases; the associate moves out of the set to allow the set to be labeled
and integrated in the structure. It will be shown that this labeling analysis
captures many of the peculiarities of Q-float, among which are two
apparently conflicting facts: the locality restrictions on floating quantifiers
and, in many cases, the impossibility for the floating quantifier and
the associate to have formed a continuous constituent at any stage of
the derivation. The facts and analysis presented contribute to the debate
on whether floating quantifiers mark the positions of lower copies
of displaced nominals (NP traces in pre-minimalist terms), providing an
argument that, at least for Arabic, the answer is ‘yes’. It also provides additional
support for the labeling framework that emerged from Chomsky
(2013) and related work.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004145/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004145<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Al Khalaf, E.
