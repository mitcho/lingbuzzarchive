When hanaxa combines with CPs, it behaves like a non-factive verb meaning ‘think’. However, when it takes nominalized clauses as its complement, it exhibits a factive inference and is naturally translated as ‘remember’. I assume the decompositional approach to the semantics of attitude reports (Kratzer 2016; Bogal-Allbritten 2017; Elliott 2017) and argue that the factivity alternation arises because CPs and nominalized expressions combine in different ways: while CPs modify the verb’s event argument and provide the content of thoughts, nominalized clauses saturate the internal argument, which for the verb meaning ‘think’ denotes the topic of thoughts — what the thinking is about. I propose that there is a pre-existence presupposition associated with this about-argument: an entity that is the topic of thoughts is presupposed to have started existing before the time of the thinking eventuality. I argue that this presupposition is what gives rise to the factive inference with nominalized expressions and what the ‘remember’ translation is trying to convey.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005006/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005006<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>accepted at Glossa</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>factivity alternation, pre-existence presupposition, trivalence, nominalized clauses, semantics of attitude verbs, buryat, mongolic, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005006/v2.pdf">v2 [July 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005006/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>232 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005006">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005006">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
