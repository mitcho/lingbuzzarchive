The acceptability status of this construction in English remains controversial, and the judgments reported in the literature vary significantly (cf., Takahashi 1994; Nishigauchi 1998; Merchant 2001; Lasnik 2014; Kotek & Barros 2018). Therefore, obtaining experimental results on the acceptability status of MS is crucial for successful future investigations of this configuration. Here, I focus on two factors that have been reported to influence the acceptability of English multiple sluicing: prepositionhood, which is the presence or absence of a prepositional wh-phrase as the non-initial remnant, and weight, which refers to the number of heads following the wh-word in a non-initial remnant. The results of my experiments show that, despite multiple sluicing generally being a marked construction in English, speakers exhibit clear preferences for some configurations over others. First, the presence of a prepositional wh-remnant improves the overall acceptability of multiple sluicing sentences, which confirms claims from the literature (e.g., Richards 2010; Lasnik 2014). I argue that this preference is observed because prepositions provide additional cues which facilitate the retrieval of the information presented in the antecedent (cf. Martin & Mcelree 2008, 2011). Second, the results presented here reveal a significant negative effect on the overall acceptability of English multiple sluicing in the presence of a heavy wh-phrase, contra Lasnik (2014). I will interpret these results as motivated by information-structural factors, namely the reiteration of given material causing a penalty in the perceived acceptability of multiple sluicing sentences. Moreover, my experiment on German confirms that the multiple sluicing in this language is not modulated by the factors of prepositionhood and weight. I claim that the differences observed for prepositionhood and weight in the two examined languages can be captured by an implementation of a cue-based retrieval approach to ellipsis (Martin & Mcelree 2008, 2011; Nykiel, Kim & Sim 2022), once coupled with stipulations about the differing grammaticality status of MS in English and German.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007930/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007930<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>	To appear in A.
