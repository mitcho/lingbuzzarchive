An important observation that came out of this discussion is that there appears to be some kind of interaction between a classifier head (call it Cl) and definiteness, where either Cl and D interact through head movement (Simpson 2005), or the Cl head itself introduces an iota-operator. Cheng and Sybesma note that in Cantonese, which exhibits bare Cl-N sequences with a definite interpretation, the addition of a numeral has the effect of "undoing the definiteness". The standard approach to accounting for this blocking of definiteness is that of Simpson (2005), where it is suggested that for a definite interpretation to arise in classifier languages, the Cl head has to move to D (in the spirit of Longobardi 1994). The blocking of a definite interpretation in Cantonese is the result of a Head Movement Constraint violation; Cl cannot move to D over the numeral. I show that this numeral blocking effect extends to other languages too, and I argue based on data from those languages that a Head Movement Constraint-based account of definiteness in classifier languages cannot capture the facts, and that we require an alternative. I put forward a proposal which has the consequence that the classifier and numeral form a constituent to the exclusion of the noun, and then discuss some suggestive evidence in favour of such a structural configuration.
