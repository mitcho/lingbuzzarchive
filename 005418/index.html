The difference between the readings is argued to derive  from a minimal difference in the overtness vs. covertness of the focus associate of be-sax ha-kol: Whereas the exclusive reading is standardly derived by associating the particle with overt and prosodically marked material, the approximative reading results from its association with the covert degree modifier pos modifying gradable expressions, resulting in an inference: “x is pos A, but not maximally A”. 

We show that this reading of be-sax ha-kol is only licensed when the scale associated with the gradable expression is upper-bound, but the standard of comparison is not necessarily maximal, pace Kennedy & McNally 2005, and compare it with the effects  of ‘true’ approximators (like more or less). We also observe that relative to e.g. only, and to the exclusive reading of be-sax ha-kol, the (not) at-issueness status of the positive and negative components in the approximative reading is reversed, being  at-issue vs. not-at-issue, respectively. We discuss this observation in light of claims about the mirror imaged status of components of only vs. p-exh argued in Bassi et al. 2019, and in light of theories arguing for the gradience and flexibility of at-issueness status of interpretive components and its sensitivity to information structure (as in Abrusán 2011, Tonhauser et a 2018, 2020).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005418/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005418<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Glossa</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>focus, exclusive, approximative, gradable-adjectives, degree modifiers, alternatives, at-issueness, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005418/v2.pdf">v2 [August 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005418/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>994 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005418">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005418">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
