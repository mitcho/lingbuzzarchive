The present article addresses parallels and differences between these two kinds of complements and makes suggestions as to an explanation of their heterogeneous distribution and prop-erties with respect to mobility and Operator scope. Of particular interest for current syntactic theories is the question how these complements are attached. It will be argued that CPs with initial complementizers are indirectly licensed via coindexing with a pronominal dement that may also be nullified. CPs with final complementizers seem to be licensed directly. The article also contains data on negative sentences and negative polarity licensing which are of immediate rele-vance for theories of phrase structure which subscribe to the idea that linear order automatically mirrors hierarchical order such as c-command. The article closes with speculations about the Status of languages which seem to follow conflicting word order parameters. Suggestions are made of how conflicts of this kind can be kept under control by the learner.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000698/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000698<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Bhaskarorao, P. & K.V.
