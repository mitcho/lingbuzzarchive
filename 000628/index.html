Proper names like those in (1)-(3) are traditionally regarded either as nonprototypical proper names (Van Langendonck 2007) or as common nouns due to the syntactic environment in which they appear (Borer 2005). I regard them as nominalizations with a root Person at their core. First, I present the basic data focussing in particular on the grammatical gender of PUCs in Belgian Dutch (Dutch spoken in the northern half of Belgium) and German.  Second, I examine the possibility of a PF-deletion analysis for PUCs. This will turn out to be successful for the German data, but not for the Belgian Dutch data. Then, I argue against an empty noun analysis for the Belgian Dutch data and in finally, I present my own account, which crucially involves postulating an empty suffix in Belgian Dutch PUCs.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000628/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000628<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistics in the Netherlands 2008</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>proper names - gender, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>172 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000628">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000628">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
