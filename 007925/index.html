Those grammatical mappings are often ambiguous, temporarily or even permanently, over the course of the clause. Given ambiguous cues, which mappings are easiest for the comprehender to process upon disambiguation, and why? The present study on Georgian, a split-ergative language with flexible word order, was designed to shed light on these questions. It tracked word-by-word reading times of sentences that, due to a complex morphosyntactic grammar, were incrementally ambiguous between a wide range of argument structures and word orders. Crucial disambiguating cues appeared at the verb, where tense/voice morphology unlocked the sentence’s case–role mapping and thus word order. A few clear patterns emerge across the reading times of these disambiguating verbs. Given one noun that is incrementally ambiguous, cues that show its role to be an active transitive subject are not processed differently than cues to a nonactive intransitive subject. Given two role-ambiguous nouns, there is an interaction between word order and case mapping. It is relatively hard to process patient-first transitives that are morphologically/ semantically noncanonical, but it is not hard to process either patient-first canonical transitives or agent-first noncanonical ones. It seems, then, that Georgian comprehenders do not prioritize identifying an event’s agent above all else. Finally, affectee applicatives always cause processing difficulty, even for nonactives. This is notable because the temporarily ambiguous arguments were overwhelmingly high in animacy. If comprehenders sought to map high-animacy arguments to a role with as many prototypically agent-like properties as possible, then there should have been many contexts where indirect objects (which tend to least have some agent-like properties) were easier to process than direct objects (which tend to have few if any). Together, these results support a theory where prototypically transitive clauses, with two arguments highly distinct in thematic interpretation, are privileged during sentence comprehension.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007925/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007925<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sentence processing, georgian, case, split ergativity, grammatical roles, prominence scales, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>341 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007925">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007925">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
