That makes the analysis complicated and it betrays the principle of economy. The author of this paper proposed that the inverted Subject should right-adjoin to IP instead of VP. He applies many a testified principles and ideas to verify his argument, including bounding nodes, barrier and the mechanism of ¦Ã-marking. Because In Italian the bounding nodes are CP and DP£¬IP is not a bounding nodes, as in English, so it is expected that adjunction to IP is language specific and the author tries to prove this assumption through the principles of barrier and the mechanism of ¦Ã-marking. The fact is that wh-phrase, in moving out of IP, adjoins to IP first, for adjunction to VP can not account for the phenomenon that a wh-phrase extracting out of a wh-island but no Subjection violation arises in Italian.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000367/current.doc">doc</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000367<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>that-trace effect  adjunction  bounding node  barrier  mechanism of ¦Ã-marking, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>318 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000367">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000367">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
