In order to better understand this relationship, I establish new methods for reasoning about language acquisition in the past. I demonstrate that certain aspects of child linguistic experience may be reasonably estimated from historical corpora and employ a quantitative model of productivity learning to investigate the role acquisition played as the driver of four well-documented instances of phonological, syntactic, and morphological change: transparent /aɪ/-raising in modern North American English, the innovation and lexical spread of the to-dative in Middle English, the analogy of the lengthened *ē-grade in Proto-Germanic strong verbs, and the forms of the past participles and t-deverbals in Classical and Late Latin. These case studies provide new insights into the implications of sparsity and variation on the first language acquisition process, the role that acquisition plays as the actuator of community-level change, and the complementary nature of acquisition and diachronic evidence for synchronic representation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005230/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005230<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Pennsylvania Dissertation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>child language acquisition, historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, computational linguistics, english, middle english, proto-germanic, latin, morphology, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>466 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005230">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005230">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
