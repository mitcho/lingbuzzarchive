accumulated a growing body of evidence that what appears to be a morphophonologically single verb
is in fact decomposed into a series of semantically contentful functional projections and roots (Hale
and Keyser 1993, Harley 1995, 2002, Kratzer 1996, Beck and Johnson 2004, to mention a few; see
Harley 2012 for a recent summary), suggesting a return to a sharply constrained minimalist syntactic
version of the deep insights of Generative Semantics (Morgan 1969; Lakoff 1970; McCawley 1971).
In this paper, we will furnish novel evidence for this decompositional theory of verb meanings
through a previously unexplored angle of VP-ellipsis. Our central observation is that VP-ellipsis can
target a sub-lexical constituent of a verb’s structured meaning. We formulate a condition on
VP-ellipsis that makes crucial reference to a superset-subset relation between the syntactic structures
of the antecedent and the elided constituent. We then use this condition on VP-ellipsis as a probe into
the articulated internal structure of VPs, (dis-)confirming particular decompositional analyses for
controversial cases of verbs such as kill, want, give, open, melt, etc.
A number of important implications arise from this work. Firstly, because the superset-subset
relation makes reference to (morpho-)syntactic identity, the data reported here constitute a powerful
argument that ellipsis must be sensitive to syntactic structure, not just phonological identity, as argued
in Goldberg (2005). Secondly, roots (or at least indices) must be present in the syntactic representation
(Harley 2004) to evaluate proper containment relations between the antecedent-ellipsis pairs for verbs
that show the causative-inchoative alternation, contra researchers who argue that roots are inserted late
post-syntactically (Halle and Marantz 1993; Marantz 1995; Haugen 2009; Haugen and Siddiqi 2013).
Lastly, granted that decompositional effects of verbs are real, the question remains whether the
relevant decomposition takes place in the syntax or at some other pre-syntactic level of representation
such as the GB-style lexicon or the so-called Lexical Conceptual Structure (Pustejovsky 1991; Levin
and Rappaport-Hovav 1995). Our results reported here show that the decomposition in question must
be represented within syntax, a theoretical conclusion that is also echoed in von Stechow (1995) and
Beck and Johnson (2004) in their analyses of scope ambiguities with again in double object verbs.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004694/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004694<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms, Seisen University/University of Arizona (to be included in the pre-conference research report for GLOW in Asia 12/SICOGG 21)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>lexical decomposition; generative semantics; fine structure of vps; prepositional have: transitive have; distributed morphology; timing of root insertion; root content, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>584 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004694">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004694">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
