Grammars tend to resolve the situation by eliminating one of the two cases, and this is what I look at in this book. Specifically, I investigate the rules and constraints that accompany this process, and argue that such facts can be understood if case competition is nothing but ellipsis of a case-marker under c-command and identity with (a subpart of) the remaining case marker.

 As a consequence, the notion of case competition is eliminated from the grammar at the level of underlying mechanisms, and its effects are subsumed under the theory of ellipsis.

The account is formulated in the framework of Nanosyntax. The basic idea of the framework is that syntactic structures are formed from atomic morphosyntactic features. The book describes the state-of-the-art of the theory and adds some new mechanisms on top of it, allowing for a new perspective on a wide range of theoretical concepts such as concord, head movement, feature lowering, affix hopping and others.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004875/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004875<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to be revised, comments welcome</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>case competition; syncretism; numerals; nanosyntax, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004875/v3.pdf">v3 [November 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004875/v2.pdf">v2 [November 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004875/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>189 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004875">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004875">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
