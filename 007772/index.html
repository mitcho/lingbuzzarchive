The chapter provides an overview of the internal structure of the Determiner Phrase (DP) in several Asian languages, and discusses different syntactic phenomena and recent debates. The chapter is divided into four parts, each part addressing an important aspect of the DP-structure, with corresponding relevant case studies from several Asian languages. First, the chapter discusses the general structure of the DP as proposed for various Asian numeral-classifier languages (Li 1998 for Mandarin, Simpson and Ngo 2018 for Vietnamese, Syed 2017 for Bangla). The next section discusses different kinds of movement inside the DP. Akin to N-D movement in Romance, head-movement is argued inside the nominal domain of Asian languages as well, in the form of N-CL movement (Cheng and Sybesma 1999 for Mandarin and Cantonese, Simpson and Ngo 2018 for Vietnamese), and in the form of N-D movement (Davies and Dresser 2005 for Madurese). In addition to head-movement, it has been shown that several Asian languages exhibit phrasal movement of NP as well (Bhattacharya 1999, Chacon 2012, Dayal 2012, Syed 2017 for Bangla). Then, complex patterns inside the Madurese DP are discussed, which are taken to suggest that Madurese allows both N-movement and NP-movement inside the DP (Syed 2020). Thirdly, the chapter addresses the NP vs DP debate, a debate relevant for many Asian languages which do not have definite articles. In an interesting and influential series of works on this topic, Bošković (2008, 2009) and Bošković and Gajewski (2011) have suggested that languages which do not have articles are ‘NP languages’ and nominal constituents in such languages have no level of DP structure, and that these languages display a number of common syntactic characteristics, which may all be attributed to the absence of DP. This debate is discussed with the case study of Bangla, which has no articles, and yet behaves like typical DP-languages (following Syed 2017, and Syed and Simpson 2017). Finally, the chapter discusses a debate regarding headedness inside the nominals. Arguments are presented from Simpson (2021) that analyzing elements inside Japanese and Korean nominals to be head-initial even though Japanese and Korean are otherwise head-final languages might give straightforward explanations for attested patterns within the nominal domain of these languages.
