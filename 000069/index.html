the difference between "a picture of whom" and "whose picture".  Intuitional

and acquisition evidence is presented to argue that Immediate-feature-checking

is preferred over Deep-Feature-checking.  A modularized view of economy is

advanced that disagrees with the uniform theory of locality advocated for

these phenomena by Fitzpatrick (2003). 

    Evidence that do-insertion is a First Resort, not last Resort follows from

this view because Features are immediately checked.  Children spontaneously

produce "do it be colored" and many other instances.

    A diffferent approach to the presence of AGR in questions (doesn't he/

he don't) offers an alterntive to an account by Rizzi and preserves the 

possibility that AGR is inside Tense.
