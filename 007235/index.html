Croft 2001; Hengeveld 1992). Typically, such pragmatic accounts argue
that nouns distinguish themselves by referring, verbs distinguish themselves
by predicating and adjectives distinguish themselves by modifying. The current
article argues that such accounts are prone to two distinct sets of problems.
The first set of problems arise from the definitions of the pragmatic
functions that are employed in these accounts. Thus, the definitions of predication and modification that feature in such accounts are typically so similar they render attempts to distinguish verbs and adjectives in terms of them vacuous. Moreover, the definitions of all three pragmatic functions are
often so vague and general that they apply with equal ease to words of all
three major lexical categories. When more specific definitions are given,
however, they typically exclude words from their intended category while
continuing to include words from other categories. The second set of problems
arise from the lack of direct evidence for the pragmatic functions.
Such an absence of evidence gives rise to disputes over issues as basic as
whether a given lexical category performs a given pragmatic function or
not, whether there are two, three or more pragmatic functions and whether
pragmatic functions are performed by words, phrases or different units altogether. It is argued that in the absence of direct evidence such basic disputes cannot be satisfactorily resolved. It is concluded that these problems are as serious as those which afflict semantic and morphosyntactic approaches to
lexical categories and thus that the prospects for a coherent explanation of
lexical categories remain as remote as ever.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007235/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007235<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>lexical categories, grammar, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>454 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007235">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007235">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
