  The thesis studies the syntax of floating quantifiers (FQ) and the related constructions in Chinese. Investigation on the behaviors of the movement and the unmoved types has been the focus together with Bei- and You-clause as the object of inquiry. I demonstrate that Q-float is to satisfy the functions of the outer and inner topic and the subject, and argue that the sole focus function of the inner topic position is unjustifiable. The subject in Chinese is filled up by the strained quantifier which contrasts with Germanic and Romance languages. Floats to outer and inner topic are A¡¯-movement and to subject A-movement. This argues against the hypothesis of A-movement to inner topic position. The topic constructions of FQ type are also divided into dangling and non-dangling which naturally assumes the unmoved type in FQ. Movement in FQ abides by the locality condition.



  FQ in Bei-clause appears as though passivization is realized by Q-float with FQ strained in the base position. I argue that passivization in Chinese requires no NP-movement. Bei as a verb has the meaning undergo or suffer which subcategorizes an external argument and a clausal type object. Realization of the subject either by A- or A¡¯-movement is unattainable. Bei-clause demonstrates a passivization mechanism departed from that of other languages such as English.



  You is normally added to a quantifier modifying an NP in topic or subject or an FQ in such positions. I argue that You is an existential verb compatible only with weak quantifiers in Milsark¡¯s (1974) sense. Existential You naturally has the ability of limiting the reference of a DP and makes it get a strong reading of the kind of specific indefinites. Thus, You+DP tends to take a strong reading which is unavailable in English existentials. On the other hand, an object position in a sentence tends to require a DP with weak reading. This requirement contradicts with You+DP¡¯s strong meaning tendency and makes You+DP hardly seen in object positions. As a dual-function element, You can realize either as a verb in an existential clause or a D-head in a DP. You in most cases only exercises its reference limiting power.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001064/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001064<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD dissertation, Capital Normal University, Beijing</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>floating quantifier, bei-clause, you-clause, passivization, existential, topic, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>530 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001064">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001064">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
