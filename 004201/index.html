Setting aside topicality, we track two features, [FoC] and [G]. [FoC] serves to highlight contrasts and aims for highest possible prominence in a sentence. [G] is sensitive to discourse givenness and resists phrase-level prominence. There is no marking of newness: The apparent prosodic effects of newness are the result of default prosody. 

For the phonology, the assumption that information structure notions are carried by genuine morphosyntactic features leads to the expectation that information structure and prosody do not interact directly. As bona fide morphosyntactic features, [FoC] and [G] should be spelled out in underlying phonological representation. From there, the surface prosodic manifestations of givenness and contrast should be the responsibility of the phonology alone. We present an ‘existence proof’ showing how the prosodic effects of givenness and focus could come about through a combination of spellout conditions at the syntax-phonology interface and purely phonological constraints that are motivated independently of information structure.      

For the semantics, the assumption that [FoC] and [G] are bona fide morphosyntactic features means that they should have meanings that fall into attested paradigms for such features. Moreover, the assumption that there are two distinct features representing givenness and contrast in Standard American and British English means that there should also be two distinct strategies for marking discourse coherence in those varieties of English: one for marking givenness and one for marking contrasts. We show that those expectations are borne out.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004201/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004201<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>The current version is thoroughly revised and has been submitted to a journal.
