Not so much that idioms are listed, but the question as to whether the mismatch between syntax and semantics they represent is reflected in their morpho-syntactic flexibility or in their lexical representation. Everyone seems to agree that (phrasal) idioms are listed in a storage place of idiosyncratic information, often called ‘the lexicon’: here syntax and morphology meet. Semantic idiosyncrasy in morphology is all around but generally not taken as a manifestation of idiomaticity as defined by syntacticians. That is unfortunate because idiomaticity in morphology perhaps illustrates better that idiomaticity is more than non-compositionality. It is about conventionalisation, manifested as collocational restrictions. This entry will demonstrate that from that perspective idiomaticity manifests itself abundantly in morphology and is differently tackled by recent theories such as Construction Morphology and Distributed Morphology<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008336/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008336<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>The Wiley Blackwell Companion to Morphology</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>idiom: collocation; compositionality; construction morphology; distributed morphology, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>237 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008336">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008336">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
