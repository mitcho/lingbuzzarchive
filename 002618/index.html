Using restructuring as a probe into the composition of the voice domain, several properties are revealed which provide new or additional support for a number of voice-related assumptions. First, the distribution of restructuring supports a split voice domain consisting of VoiceP and vP, following much recent work. Second, cross-linguistic morphological differences in the realization of voice properties are accounted for in a cyclic spell-out approach with vocabulary insertion applying incrementally. Third, we argue that the phasal projection of the voice domain is the top projection of the entire voice domain, whichever projection that is, and that the voice domain always constitutes a phase (i.e., also in ‘weak’ voice contexts such as passive). Lastly, we propose that the heads of the voice domain come with two sets of features, v/Voice-features and ϕ-features, where the former encode differences such as active and passive, as well as specific flavors of the argument or event introducing heads (AGENT, CAUSER, and others), and the latter identify a DP (the DP valuing the ϕ-features) as an argument of the particular voice head. We propose detailed structures for passive and restructuring, including morphological spell-out rules for the heads of the voice domain in several languages (Acehnese, Chamorro, Isbukun Bunun, German, Japanese, Mayrinax Atayal, Norwegian, and Takibakha Bunun).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002618/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002618<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Volume on little v</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>voice domain, passive, restructuring, voice, little v, cyclic spell-out, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2891 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002618">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002618">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
