They resemble the Dutch s-possessive in that their non-heads involve movement to a referential layer. However, unlike the possessive structures, the compounding structure contains head incorporation which results in word-hood. The referential compound is therefore an instance of the fourth logical possibility according to the two parameters defined by Borer (2011) for N-N combinations: compounding versus constructs and modificational structures versus referential ones. The article further discusses title expressions, such as prince Charles, which are argued to be referential construct states. Together with the syntactic structure of titles plus proper names, the referential compounds further contribute evidence to the idea that a ban on N-to-D movement for certain uniquely referring roots, such as sun and Bronx is extra-syntactic.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006570/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006570<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dutch; compounding; n-to-d movement, referentiality; longobardi; borer, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>627 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006570">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006570">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
