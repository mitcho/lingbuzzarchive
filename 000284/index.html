Inspired by HalldÃ¶r SigurÃ°sson  I see morphological case as a kind of morphological translation of syntactic structure into the language of PF. The main part of the paper is an attempt to account for nominative, accusative and dative in modern Icelandic in terms of Agree-relations between T/v and DPs.

   The syntactic account presented here is an implementation of recent ideas within the Minimalist program (Chomsky, Pesetsky & Torrego), according to which the syntactic derivation is driven by features with the help of the operation Agree. I use a very simple system of features, a tense feature Ï that is interpretable in T and v and uninterpretable in DPs, and Ï-features that are interpretable in DPs but uninterpretable in T and v. In addition, I assume UTAH (Baker 1997). Finally, in line with Hale & Keyser (2002) I assume that V always has a complement, sometimes visible but in other cases without phonological representation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000284/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000284<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Working Papers in Scandinavian Syntax 77 (June 2006), 71-99.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>case, nominative, accusative, dative, icelandic, abstract case, features, agree, probe-goal, the new passive, argument structure, quirky subjects, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>790 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000284">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000284">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
