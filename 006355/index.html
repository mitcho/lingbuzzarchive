That said, cognition and physiology exist and function in tandem in the human body and language is used by the individual's mind and body. Under the assumption that language structure is shaped by language use by the human individual as mind and body I  present a counter argument that the modality, i.e. the  channel of externalization, influences the language system  through its influence on language use. Scholars discern two differently organized versions of language use, i.e. inferential system , usually externalized by speech, and code system, usually externalized by writing . Sign languages  are naturally suited for  face-to-face interaction. Each covers different language  functions , in part influenced by the modality/channel of externalization . That said, given that sign language users live within a society where the overwhelming majority of humans are speakers, sign languages have developed grammatical complexity matching that of the code system to facilitate this communication. Thus, the organization of language is influenced by human physiology as perceptual-motor vehicle for externalization of the language system which partly determines the context of language use and is a contributing factor in language evolution. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006355/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006355<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>biolinguistics, functionalism, speech, grammar, writing, language evolution, ug, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>546 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006355">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006355">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
