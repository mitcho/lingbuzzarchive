Mcgowan</a><br/>December 2019</center>&nbsp;<p></p>The tendency for longer, complex phrases to come at the end of clauses has been formalized in a number of ways, for instance by theories which relate relative end-weight to the acceptability of different constituent orders. One class of theories suggests that Heavy NP Shift is driven by consideration of the parser, which has been argued to favor Heavy NP Shift when the shifted order reveals VP-internal constituent structure more quickly than the canonical order. This paper tests theories of Heavy NP Shift which link constituent order to constituent identification. While controlling for other factors known to affect Heavy NP Shift, our results indicate that increasing the weight of an object NP can not make a Heavy NP Shift construction more acceptable than a comparison sentence in the canonical order, regardless of constituent identification. In addition, we examine acceptability as it relates to verb disposition, which has been linked to constituent identification in prior literature. We find no significant differences between verbs with different subcategorizations, contrary to the findings of corpus studies. We therefore reveal a disconnect between production and comprehension, and we conclude that parser sensitivity to constituent structure is unlikely to affect speaker production of Heavy NP Shift.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005546/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005546<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Inquiry (2021)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>heavy np shift, end-weight, constituent order, acceptability judgment, english, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>346 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005546">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005546">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
