which I call double reciprocals. In these constructions, two reciprocal

markers: the suffix "-sja" and the reciprocal pronoun "drug druga" 'each other' in the

instrumental case are used simultaneously. Contrary to standard constructions,

which were described in detail both in descriptive and in formal research, this construction has never been a subject of a separate

linguistic research.

I will examine the contexts of use of this construction in order to

show that its semantic and pragmatic properties are different from those

of standard reciprocal constructions. The pronoun "drug druga" does not introduce the component of reciprocity, since reciprocity is already coded with the suffix "-sja". What the pronoun really expresses is plurality of events.

This use of the pronoun "drug druga" cannot be accounted for by the standard notion of reciprocity. A reanalysis of the reciprocal marker "drug druga" is necessary to explain the component of plurality and the statistical tendencies of use of the double reciprocal construction. I build a formal semantic representation for this construction and conclude that "drug druga" marks a special type of plurality - plurality of events with different participants.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000988/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000988<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of FDSL 7.5 (in production)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>reciprocals, weak and strong reciprocity, transitivity, plurality of events, russian language, co-reference, formal semantics, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000988/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2009]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>490 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000988">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000988">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
