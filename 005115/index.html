this report continues from two previous in lingbuzz, ‘the grid of language’ in mar 2010  and ‘the amazing rule of four’ in feb 2016.   latecomers and strangers to the tagalog grid  should visit the latter at least to gain best from this following work.  i take it up from where i left off there, from these conclusions in particular:  “the quadrisections, we find, are telling our mental world apart: the grid is like a coordinate system for our organism’s information sources.  and this final foursome--{senses, memory, mind, brain}--obviously represents four separate but communicating circuitries of an organism that are together responsible for its continued survival. . . and should you wonder what kind of actions each of the foursome contributes to our language making, then that is precisely what the tagalog grid is spelling out for us, affix set by affix set, quadrisection by quadrisection.  what senses are at work?  what memories are required?  what actions are available?  what conclusions are desirable?”. . . in which light i now revisit the two um affix sets, the volitional UM and non-volitional UM and their grids that appear in amazing.  the intention was to possibly perfect both grids according to the lines suggested by the surfaced ruling quadrisection and to see what other eurekas might be in store in that direction.  the results are frankly astonishing.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005115/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005115<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>philippines</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>cognitive semantics, tagalog grammar, lexicography, translation, natural language processing, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, philosophy of language, neurolinguistics, biolinguistics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>248 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005115">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005115">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
