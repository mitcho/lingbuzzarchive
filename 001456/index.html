We report on two nonce word studies asking Russian speakers to rate paradigms in which a vowel was deleted. The ratings strongly correlated with the quality of the vowel: deletion of mid vowels was rated higher than deletion of high and low vowels. We also found that deletion in certain syllabic contexts was rated as ungrammatical: deletion cannot affect words that have a complex coda, and it cannot create clusters with a medial sonorant. Finally, deletion in disyllables was rated higher than deletion in monosyllables, reflecting the trends in the lexicon. These results suggest that even for this lexically restricted alternation, speakers have formed a phonological generalization.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001456/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001456<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Natural Language and Linguistic Theory (2013), 31:3, pp. 735-765</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>russian, wug, nonce word, analogy, allomorphy, productivity, lexically restricted alternations, exceptions, ghost segments, ghost vowels, lexical constraint indexation, morphology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001456/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2012]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>937 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001456">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001456">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
