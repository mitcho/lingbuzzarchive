We do not currently have any generally accepted deep explanation, for example, for the fact that wh-movement is overt in English but covert in Chinese, or the fact that the verb raises to T in tensed clauses in French but not in English, or the fact that English but not Italian must move the subject to the specifier of TP.  The discovery of these cross-linguistic differences is one of the successes of modern syntactic theory, and we have discovered a great deal about the nature of the types of movement involved, but when it comes to explaining why a given movement is overt in one language but not in another, Minimalism has classically had only an array of diacritic features to offer (strong features, edge features, EPP features, and so forth).  

It could be, of course, that such diacritics are entirely appropriate; perhaps the distribution of overt and covert movement is completely idiosyncratic, and attempts to explain the facts are futile.  In this ms., I attempt to explain them anyway.  

The core idea, building on proposals I made in Richards (2010), is that the construction of phonological representations begins earlier in the derivation than standardly assumed, and that syntactic movement operations can be motivated by the need to improve the status of the phonological representation.  I posit several universal conditions on the interface between syntax and phonology, and universal operations for meeting these conditions.  Cross-linguistic variation is reduced to directly observable phonological properties, including facts about stress placement and prosodic structure.  The ultimate goal is a theory in which a complete description of the phonology of a language is also a description of its syntax.

The resulting theory accounts for the cross-linguistic distribution of wh-movement, head-movement, and EPP-driven movement to the specifier of TP, in a variety of languages.  Other phenomena discussed include Potsdam’s (2009) generalization about wh-movement in verb-initial languages, Trask (1979) and Mahajan’s (1994) generalization that ergative languages are invariably verb-peripheral in TP, and the Final-over-Final Constraint of Biberauer, Holmberg, and Roberts (to appear).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002247/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002247<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>wh-movement; head-movement; a-movement; epp; prosody; ergativity; verb-initial; typology; final-over-final constraint; stress; match theory; control; raising; wager-class, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>6192 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002247">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002247">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
