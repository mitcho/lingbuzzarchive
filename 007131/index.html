Next to nothing is known about the phonetic nature of kobushi, and thus, as a first step toward addressing this gap in the literature, this paper offers the first quantitative, phonetic exploration of kobushi. The current study found that (1) kobushi involves an abrupt F0 rise of about 70 Hz on average, which is implemented within about 30 ms, that (2) some kobushi type seems to be easier to be implemented with a neighboring voiceless obstruent, while the other type seems less compatible with a neighboring obstruent, and that (3) kobushi tends to appear on high musical notes, usually around and above 400 Hz, and that (4) intensity is not a defining characteristic of kobushi.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007131/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007131<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>ICU Working Papers in Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonetics, singing voice, kobushi, f0 control, consonant-tone interaction, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>269 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007131">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007131">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
