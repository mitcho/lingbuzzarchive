It is shown that Russian echo questions exhibit evidence of at least two patterns of wh-movement, apart from the standard wh-in-situ option. The echo wh-phrase can appear immediately preverbally or at the leftmost position of a clause. These facts are claimed to follow from standard assumptions about the properties of wh-movement in multiple wh-fronting languages (Richards 2001), Q-movement (Cable 2010), and a particular syntactic structure that underlies echo constructions (Sobin 2010). It is also observed that in echo questions which repeat a previous binary wh-question the wh-phrases copied from the antecedent utterance are inaccessible for the echo-introduced wh-item. The paper develops an account of this restriction within Multiple Spell-out theory (Uriagereka 1999). On this view, the computational system takes the echoed utteranceâ€™s wh-words as a complex object and spells it out before merging with the main tree; consequently, its constituents become inaccessible for the further syntactic derivation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001963/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001963<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001963">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001963</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Analysis 38(3-4)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>wh-movement, echo questions, spell out, russian, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>276 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001963">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001963">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
