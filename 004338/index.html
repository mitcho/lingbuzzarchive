Despite its importance, the definition and testing diagnostics for the notion of contrast, and the associated notion of contrastive focus, are still under debate; see amongst others Rooth (1992), Büring (1997, 2003), Kiss (1998), Molnár (2002), Kenesei (2006), Zimmerman (2007, 2008), Krifka (2008), Repp (2010), Horvath (2010), Krifka & Musan (2012), Neeleman & Vermeulen (2012). as well as the several articles in Molnár & Winkler (2006) and Repp & Cook (2010). 
In order to progress, we need to systematically identify the linguistic domains where the proposed analyses make divergent predictions, as this enables their testing. This paper takes a step in this direction by carefully comparing the definition of contrast in Krifka (2008), which requires contrast with propositions in the common ground, against the definition in Neeleman and Vermeulen (2012), which requires the intended denial by the speaker of one of the alternative propositions evoked by focalization. While the two definitions are clearly different, the original papers describing them do not systematically discuss their differences, leaving readers unclear about the status of these two definitions relative to each other. Does one definition subsume the other? Or are they genuinely distinct? In the latter case, do we need both?
To answer these questions, this paper examines nine distinct focus-eliciting contexts, several of them left undiscussed or only briefly touched in Krifka’s and N&V’s original papers: open and closed questions, corrective exchanges, four types of confirmative exchanges, and two types of additive exchanges. For each context, the paper examines which definitions predict contrast to be present or absent. 
The main result of the paper is the detection of four contexts where Krifka’s and N&V’s definitions of contrast make divergent predictions: closed question exchanges, two types of confirmative exchanges, and one type of affirmative exchanges (all exchange types are described in detail in later sections). The detected contexts also prove that the the two definitions do not subsume each other, since the two contexts predicted to involve contrast by N&V’s definition are expected to lack contrast under Krifka’s definition, and vice versa for the other two contexts.
The identified contexts are also the contexts where the two definitions should be empirically tested to determine which one provides the best model for the notion of ‘contrast’. Full experimental testing is beyond the scope of this paper, but I will discuss some preliminary results that suggest support for N&V’s definition. The first concerns sentences where focalization is followed by a continuation sentence that is inconsistent with N&V’s definition of contrast but not Krifka’s, making an assessment possible. The second concerns the informal testing of 17 native speakers of British English using focus fronting as a proxy for the presence of contrast. 
While this is not its immediate goal, this study also contributes to the determination of how many  distinct types of focalization exist. The nine exchange contexts considered in this paper are shown to always involve focalization a la Rooth (1992), defined in terms of evoked alternative propositions, and, where necessary, contrast, determining whether focalization is or isn’t contrastive. Nothing else is necessary. Therefore, terms like ‘corrective focus’, ‘confirmative focus’, ‘additive focus’, etc, where focus is qualified in terms of the exchanges eliciting it, are misleading. They incorrectly suggest the existence of distinct types of focalization when focalization à la Rooth is sufficient. They also incorrectly suggest that contrast remains invariant within each exchange, whereas, as we will see, the same exchange might involve focalization with or without contrast depending on the content of the common ground and the intentions of the speakers at the time of the exchange. This will be shown to be the case with confirmative and additive exchanges.
What this paper does not supply is a comprehensive comparison of all existing alternative definitions of contrast available in the literature, although a few are briefly discussed in section 5. This is intentional. At the level of detail considered here, an exhaustive study of that type would quickly run into space restrictions, and involve excessive complexity and cluttering at the expense of clarity. The desired comprehensive clarity can also be pursued stepwise. This self-contained, short paper, spelling out the theoretical differences and predictions of Krifka’s and N&V’s notions of contrast, aims at providing a step in that direction.
Finally, in my experience many graduate students, and occasionally even fellow scholars interested in focalization but not directly researching it, sometimes struggle with the notion of evoked propositions involved in Rooth’s focalization. I want this paper to be easily understandable to these readers as well, and for this reason I made every reasoning step as explicit as possible. Apologies to all those more expert readers who will find some explanations somewhat pedantic.
Section 2 introduces the notion of focalization à la Rooth and the definitions of contrast by N&V (2012) and Krifka (2008), illustrated using corrective and open question exchanges. Section 3 deepens the comparison by examining their predictions across closed questions, confirmative exchanges, and additive exchanges. Section 4 describes the preliminary observations supporting N&V’s definition. Section 5 concludes with some brief reflections over how these results extend to other notions of contrast, other focalization exchanges, and their crosslinguistic validity.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004338/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004338<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms. UCL</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>contrast focus fronting, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004338/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>105 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004338">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004338">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
