The alternation between overt and covert raising is analyzed as higher vs. lower copy pronunciation and the alternation between raising of the ergative vs. absolutive argument is argued to be due to the two DPs being equidistant from the hyperraising probe. The construction exhibits two additional properties of note, namely "case-override" (an overtly raised transitive subject surfaces with absolutive case) and insensitivity to the Ergative Extraction Constraint (an ergative subject can be raised). The former casts new light on the Dependent Case analysis that is standardly assumed for the language. In particular, there is a tension between the case-override pattern and Baker's (2015:272) assumption that if a member of a movement chain is assigned dependent case, all members of the chain bear that case. The insensitivity to the Ergative Extraction Constraints, in turn, presents an puzzle for the popular inversion analysis of this constraint: if the impossibility of relativizing on an ergative subject is due to generalized inversion of the absolutive object over the ergative subject, we would expect ergative subject to also not hyperraise, but they do.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007400/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007400<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of CLS 59</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>hyperraising, case, syntactic ergativity, covert movement, equidistance, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>444 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007400">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007400">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
