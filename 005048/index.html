More abstractly, this dissertation is concerned with the question of how to accommodate evaluative expressions, which the former words exemplify, within a theory of natural language meaning. To do that, I recruit tools from both metaethics and formal linguistics. From the point of view of metaethics, this dissertation defends a form of non-factualism, since it defends that evaluatives and the sen- tences in which they paradigmatically appear play a different role in communication from the standard role assigned to declarative sentences, namely, describing reality and imparting infor- mation about it. From the point of view of formal linguistics on the other hand, this work relies on advances in the semantics of gradable adjectives, which  evaluatives generally belong to, to gain insight into their semantic properties. Non-factualism is a promising account of the mean- ing of evaluative sentences in spite of the well-known Frege-Geach problem. Chapter 2 of this dissertation presses the idea that, if non-factualism is to be defended as a linguistically serious proposal, it needs to be implemented compositionally. And since evaluative adjectives are grad- able expressions, this is challenging. In particular, non-factualism is most often formulated in such a way that captures most accurately the meaning of adjectives in their positive form. The main challenge, then, is to use such formulation to derive a scalar system. With that objective in mind, the central chapters (3) and (4) of the dissertation are devoted to offering a composi- tional semantics for a propositional language enriched with a pair of positive and negative unary sentential operators, together with binary operators representing various comparative relations. Following a delineation approach, the semantics of the comparative is derived from that of the positive form. This preserves the non-factualist insight that evaluative language is primarily used to express simple attitudes of support and rejection. Subsequently, the semantic model associated with this formal language is applied to a set of natural language evaluative sentences. Further properties of evaluative adjectives are studied, such as the distinction between relative and absolute-standard adjectives and their scale type. Chapter 5 discusses the notions of judge-dependency and ordering subjectivity. In recent experimental work, Stephanie Solt has argued that the spectrum-like nature of the phenomenon of ordering subjectivity calls for a distinction, within the class of subjective adjectives, between multi-dimensional and judge- dependent ones. Her conclusions are supplemented by arguing that extending her experimental paradigm to moral adjectives suggests a further distinction, within the class of judge-dependent adjectives, between (at least) experiential and evaluative adjectives. Finally, Chapter 6 tackles the distinction between evaluative and descriptive uses of evaluative sentences. It is argued that a brand of dynamic non-factualism offers the best account of such double uses of evaluative sentences.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005048/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005048<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>evaluative adjectives, scalar semantics, non-factualism, subjectivity, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>160 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005048">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005048">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
