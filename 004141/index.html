Previously, this has been shown for Spanish (Ormazabal and Romero 2013), but I show that, in Italian, French, and Catalan causatives, a 1st/2nd person direct object is incompatible not only with dative clitics but also with full dative arguments (see also Postal 1989, Bonet 1991). This is different from the manifestation of the PCC in ditransitive contexts where only dative clitics are ruled out. The difference follows, I argue, if ditransitives in these languages have two underlying structures so that a DP introduced by ‘a/à’ can be either dative or locative, in line with broader cross-linguistic patterns (see Harley 2002; Demonte 1995, Cuervo 2003 on Spanish; Anagnostopoulou 2003, Fournier 2010 on French; Holmberg, Sheehan & van der Wal 2018 on Italian). For this reason, indirect object DPs marked with a/à must trigger PCC effects in causatives but not in ditransitives, as only in the former are they unambiguously dative. Further support for this claim comes from Spanish, a language which morphologically distinguishes locative vs. dative phrases in ditransitives via clitic doubling (Cuervo 2003) and which shows PCC effects with all animate direct objects (Ormazabal and Romero 2007, 2013). I show that these facts are compatible with approaches to the PCC based on intervention (Anagnostopoulou 2003, 2005 amongst others), but raise challenges for those which rely crucially on the weak/clitic status of datives (Bianchi 2006, Stegovec 2017). <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004141/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004141<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Language Science Press volume on datives</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pcc, dative, locative, ditransitive, structural ambiguity, causative, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004141/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>790 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004141">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004141">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
