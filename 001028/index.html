clitic SE in Slavic and Romance languages. Next to canonical constructions, in which

the reflexive clitic semantically identifies the two arguments of a transitive verb, cf. John

SE wash means John washes himself, there are constructions in which it is not possible

to identify the arguments in this way, cf. anticausatives as The glass SE broke does not

entail that the glass broke itself, it just broke. Inherently reflexive verbs do not exist

without the reflexive clitic, certain prefixes cause the morpheme SE to appear in Slavic

languages ROZ-rain *(SE) with a certain Aktionsart shift. Finally, there are impersonals

and middles, in which the reflexive clitic SE seems to play the role of an unspecified

human subject Cars SE sell means Cars are sold (by people)/People sell cars.

The thesis is built in two steps. First, I consider possible derivations of the constructions

with the reflexive clitic SE in Slavic and Romance and following Kayne (1986)

and Alboiu et al. (2004) I propose that all the constructions are derived by movement:

the argument that winds up as NOM starts out within the VP shell and moves to the

NOM position. SE, on this view, is a morpheme that blocks the argument from becoming

a direct object. This derivation is superior to the argument structure derivations

(as they face the problem of ECM constructions, cf. Marantz (1984)) and derivations

that connect the morpheme SE to the internal argument position (they predict the SE

constructions to be transitive, contrary to the facts).

Second, I claim that the reflexive clitic SE is an antipassive morpheme of the sort

known from the ergative languages. This connection is clearly supported by the range

of constructions that are created by the reflexive clitic SE in Slavic and Romance languages

on one hand and antipassive morphemes in ergative languages on the other. In

both language types, the particular morpheme (very often) creates also anticausatives,

constructions with Aktionsart shift. I derive both antipassives and constructions with

the reflexive clitic SE in a parallel fashion within the Peeling Theory of Case (Starke

(2005), Starke (2006)).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001028/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001028<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>reflexive, clitics, antipassive&lt; k, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1128 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001028">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001028">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
