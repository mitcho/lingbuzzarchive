various phenomena (see, e.g., Boas and Sag 2012; Sag et al. 2020; Kim and Michaelis 2020). For
example, a detailed analysis of the English auxiliary system by Sag et al. (2020) extensively exploits
the hierarchical network of constructional templates in Sign-Based Construction Grammar (SBCxG)
in accounting for some of the familiar and recalcitrant facts in the syntax of auxiliary verbs in English.
In particular, one of the claims made by Sag et al. (2020) is that the idiosyncratic patterns exhibited
by some of the specific lexical items (such as the auxiliary use of better and first person singular
inverted aren’t) pose significant challenges to transformational approaches (such as Pollock 1989) that
attempt to derive the core properties of the auxiliary system from abstract general principles.
Categorial grammar (CG) offers an interesting perspective in this theory comparison. While shar-
ing with traditional HPSG the spirit of strong lexicalism, the type-logical variant of CG recognizes
abstract operations in syntax similar to transformational operations which seem somewhat alien to the
surface-oriented perspective embodied in much HPSG research (see Kubota 2021). In fact, in a recent
paper, Kubota and Levine (2022) make extensive use of transformation-like operations in account-
ing for the NI(C)E properties and the do support pattern in Hybrid Type-Logical Grammar (Hybrid
TLG; Kubota and Levine 2020). One major omission in Kubota and Levine’s (2022) proposal is the
idiosyncratic patterns that Sag et al. (2020) take to be problematic for transformational approaches.
Since there is currently no direct analogue of the notion of constructions in CG (but see Steedman and
Baldridge (2011) for an interesting suggestion for lexicalizing some of the constructional templates in
Goldberg (1995)), such facts may initially seem equally challenging for CG-based approaches. The
goal of the present paper is to take up this challenge, and work out some of the beginnings of an
account of ‘constructional patterns’ within a CG-based architecture of grammar.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006534/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006534<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>categorial grammar, construction grammar, hpsg, sign-based construction grammar, type-logical grammar, hybrid type-logical grammar, auxiliary verb, lexical idiosyncrasy, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>420 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006534">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006534">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
