In six recall-based production experiments, we examined whether English speakers encode the null complementizer in sentence production using structural priming, the tendency for speakers to reuse the structure they have recently encountered. The results show that the null complementizer can be primed across distinct construction types and that this priming effect cannot be explained as the priming of the absence of the overt complementizer. These results are difficult to capture in semantic, pragmatic, or phonological terms. Furthermore, we evaluated transformer-based Large Language Models for their capacity to reproduce human priming patterns. Although they could reproduce basic priming effects, LLMs showed more sensitivity to constructional differences than humans, and they showed priming effects that were directionally opposite to human priming effects in some cases. This suggests that distributional cues alone are likely not sufficient for learning the abstract generalization governing the distribution of English complementizers. Based on these results, we argue that the structural representations speakers construct during production go beyond what they hear and say.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008261/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008261<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>psycholinguistics, syntax, complementizer, syntactic priming, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>438 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008261">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008261">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
