working memory explain several unacceptability phenomena together
known as island effects. The core proposal is that pronounciation (or,
technically speaking Spell-Out) of a sentence requires linearization of
its structure and that this task cannot be carried out without holding
some pieces of structure in buffer memory. We expect a certain subset
of syntactically possible structures to be impossible to linearize due
to lack of memory resources. As a consequence, we predict these
sentences to be judged as unacceptable. The technical analysis of
structures that contain islands reveals that their unacceptability is
caused by requiring three or more pieces of structure to be held in
buffer memory simultaneously. Not all islands are found to be the
same with respect to memory resources they require. For example,
Adjunct Islands require less memory than Subject Islands. I show that
under minimal assumptions about syntax Condition on Extraction
Domains (CED) is an incorrect generalization and original island effect
data is better explained by several independent alternatives.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005109/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005109<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Kyoto University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, island effects, working memory, ced, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>181 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005109">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005109">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
