There are no things which are appropriately called "grammaticality judgements":  there is no "grammaticality" for them to be judgements about.  Previous empirical argumentation to this effect, e.g. in Sampson & Babarczy 2014, has been seen by some as suspect because based on evidence generated by the analyst (and meagre in quantity); arguably, too, English is not the best language to examine for this purpose.  Accordingly, I confirm the findings from a larger, German-language treebank compiled by scholars with whom I have no connexion.  Having demonstrated the lack of empirical support for the grammaticality concept, I ask why it has been so widely accepted by linguists for so long.  The answer relates to various unhappy features of the academic profession of linguistics as it has developed in recent decades.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003121/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003121<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To be in a book ed. by Kertész, Rákosi, and Moravcsik</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>grammaticality, grammaticality judgement, grammaticality intuition, performance, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>531 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003121">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003121">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
