In both of them, monosyllabic items are protected from alternations more than polysyllabic items are. Two large-scale nonce word tasks confirm the productivity of the trend in both languages. We analyze the results in terms of a discrete grammatical distinction between monosyllables and polysyllables,  comparing this approach to continuous, more detail-rich models that rely on lexical statistics or phonetic duration.
We show that the discretized approach is the most accurate predictor of participants' responses, as  informationally richer models introduce irrelevant variance that diminishes their predictive force. We conclude that a relatively simple model of morphophonological alternations that describes the data in discrete, grammatical terms is closer to the one in fact employed by native speakers. A richer model is thus not always a more accurate representation of cognitive reality.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001336/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001336<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>morphophonological alternations, irregular plurals, initial syllable faithfulness, neighborhood density, phonetically-based phonology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001336/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2011]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>572 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001336">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001336">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
