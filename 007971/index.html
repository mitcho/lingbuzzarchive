wh-questions. Wh-movement can either move the entire possessive phrase (`pied piping') or it can move the possessor alone, stranding the possessum. Each option is associated with restrictions related to
the specificity of the possessum: stranding is possible only when the possessum is non-specific,
pied-piping only when it is specific. We focus primarily on the former restriction. Earlier work
on Tsotsil, and the related language, Ch'ol, analyzed the derivation with stranding as involving
subextraction, i.e., extraction of an internal possessor. We argue that subextraction is not
possible at all in Tseltalan and that therefore only an external possessor can be extracted without
pied-piping. It is fairly clear that in transitive clauses, possessors of the internal argument are
extracted as external possessors, not internal ones, as they extract only as applied objects in an
applicative construction. We extend this analysis to unaccusative clauses, arguing that the
possessor of the internal argument in an unaccusative clause, as well as to the possessor within
certain prepositional phrases, extracts from an external position. We identify this position as
Specifier of TP and propose that the phrase which occupies it is interpreted as the subject of a
categorical judgment (Kuroda 1972, among others). This analysis accounts for specificity effects
in possessor extraction and illuminates issues related to word order, predicative possession,
experiential collocations, and the nature of 'topic' positions in Mayan.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007971/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007971<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Accepted, Natural Language & Linguistic Theory</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>89 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007971">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007971">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
