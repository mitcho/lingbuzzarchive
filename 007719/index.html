This use of language is entirely ordinary. While this concept - which amounts to a set of observations and descriptions about human linguistic behavior - is most frequently associated with the work of Noam Chomsky and other generative linguists, it is a concept whose acceptance is independent of commitment to any particular linguistic theory. This is but one reason why CALU's implications for the study of both human and computational creativity have been unduly neglected. In contrast to this neglect, this paper highlights how this distinctive ability is responsible for the human coordination of language as a resource for creativity-it represents the how of human creativity, rather than what is produced by humans. Drawing from recent work done at the intersection of human and computational creativity using work from cognitive science and philosophy (Franceschelli and Musolesi, 2023), this paper seeks to remedy CALU's absence. It does so by articulating and defending this concept and putting it forward as a baseline account of how human beings engage in creative behaviors. A test of whether state-of-the-art generative Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit this ability, according to the three criteria of stimulus-freedom, unboundedness, and appropriateness to circumstance, is conducted. Remarks at the end are given on the relationship between generative linguistic theory and CALU and how this may shed some light on future developments in computational creativity.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007719/current.docx">docx</a> ][ <a href="/lingbuzz/007719/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007719<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Pre-print</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>artificial intelligence; large language models; computational creativity; creative aspect of language use; generative linguistics; cognitive science, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>182 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007719">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007719">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
