It has long been known that a sentence like "Which man and which woman did respectively the doctor talk to about himself, and the lawyer talk to about herself?" (from Postal 1998) is possible and that coreference of "him" and "John" is possible in a sentence like "John and Mary love his pet goldfish and him respectively" (from Goodall 1987) but impossible in a sentence like "John and Mary saw him and a cow respectively" (also from Goodall 1987). When paired with such observations, the theory of <i>respectively</i> interpretation proposed in Yatabe and Tam (2021) "In defense of an HPSG-based theory of non-constituent coordination" (Linguistics and Philosophy 44, pp. 1-77) entails that Binding Conditions A and B need to be formulated as constraints on the form of semantic representations. It is possible to formulate the two binding conditions as such constraints if anaphoric relations are encoded in semantic representations in a way analogous to the way they are encoded in Discourse Representation Theory.
