Much has been written about individual anaphora, but less attention has been paid to propositional anaphora. This dissertation is a comprehensive examination of propositional anaphora, which I argue behaves like anaphora in other domains, is conditioned by semantic factors, and is not conditioned by purely syntactic factors nor by the at-issue status of a proposition.

I begin by introducing the concepts of anaphora and propositions, and then I discuss the various words of English which can have this function: this, that, it, which, so, as, and the null complement anaphor. I then compare anaphora to propositions with anaphora in other domains, including individual, temporal, and modal anaphora. I show that the same features which are characteristic of these other domains are exhibited by propositional anaphora as well.

I then present data on a wide variety of syntactic constructions—including sub-
clausal, monoclausal, multiclausal, and multisentential constructions—noting which license anaphoric reference to propositions. On the basis of this expanded empirical domain, I argue that anaphoric reference to a proposition is licensed not by any syntactic category or movement but rather by the operators which take propositions as arguments.

With this generalization in hand, I turn to how such facts can be formally modeled: I review existing systems which track anaphora and/or which make use of propositional variables, and then introduce a new formalism which incorporates insights from these existing systems.

Finally, I turn to the interaction between a proposition’s availability for anaphoric reference and its discourse status (in particular, its at-issue status). Contrary to the prevailing assumption in the literature, I argue that there is no tight linking between these two properties, and that one of the tests frequently used to diagnose at-issueness in fact diagnoses only anaphoric availability. I argue that propositional anaphora and at-issueness are distinct, showing that at-issueness is neither necessary nor sufficient to determine a proposition’s anaphoric potential.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003710/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003710<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>anaphora, propositions, propositional anaphora, discourse referents, at-issueness, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>213 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003710">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003710">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
