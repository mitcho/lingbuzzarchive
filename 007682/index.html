In this paper, we focus on two them. The first one sees alternatives as alternative sentences derived through substitution operations. The second sees alternatives as alternative propositions associated with the presence of certain operators. While both these notions have been argued to be central to the derivation of a variety of inferences, it is an open question whether both of them are needed to account for pragmatically enriched meanings. This paper brings a novel perspective on this question by focusing on ignorance inferences coming from disjunctive sentences of varying complexity. We show that the predictions of the two approaches come apart for disjunction embedding conjunction and that only the notion of alternatives as alternative sentences can account for the range of ignorance inferences observed in these environments. We take this result to suggest that tightening alternatives to the presence of specific operators is too constrained of an assumption to adequately capture the distribution of ignorance inferences. We end by discussing a problematic case for the notion of alternatives as alternative sentences and sketch a solution based on formal constraints on alternatives which have been independently argued for in the literature.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007682/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007682<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>disjunction, conjunction, ignorance inferences, implicatures, inquisitive semantics, alternatives, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>457 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007682">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007682">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
