A'-movement have been based on low/high availability of coreference in sentences with and without A'-movement. We argue that this reasoning is problematic: It involves arbitrary thresholds, and the results are potentially confounded by the diﬀerent surface orders of the compared structures and non-syntactic factors. We present three experiments with designs that do not require deﬁning thresholds of ‘low’ or ‘high’ coreference values. Instead, we focus on grammatical contrasts (wh-movement vs. relativization, subject vs. object wh-movement) and aim to identify and reduce confounds. The results show that reconstruction for A0-movement of DPs is not very robust in German, contra previous ﬁndings. Our results are compatible with the view that the surface order and non-syntactic factors (e.g. plausibility,
referential accessibility of an R-expression) heavily inﬂuence coreference possibilities. Thus, the data argue against a theory that includes both reconstruction and a hard Condition C constraint. There is a residual contrast between sentences with subject/object movement, which is compatible with an account without reconstruction (and an additional non-syntactic factor) or an account with reconstruction (and a soft Condition C constraint).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006691/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006691<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Linguistics 59(3), 577-622, www.doi.org/10.1017/S0022226722000214</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>reconstruction effects, principle c, binding, experimental syntax, a'-movement, german, relative clauses, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006691/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>516 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006691">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006691">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
