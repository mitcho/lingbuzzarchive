This chapter will survey the various kinds of expressive language present in the three autochthonous Caucasian families Abkhaz-Adyghean, Kartvelian and Nakh-Daghestanian, and find they vary in terms of:

1) their morphological exponence,
2) the extent to which their overall typological profile constrains how expressive forms may be formed,
3) grammatical categories exclusive to expressives,
4) expressives as a source for lexical innovation,
5) expressives as a locus of diachronic change

It will also look in-depth at the specific morphological and syntactic peculiarities of expressives in Georgian, which exhibit exuberant consonant clusters, processes of reduplication uncharacteristic of the language as a whole, as well as specific morphosyntactic alignment splits between different classes of expressive. Expressives will be seen not to be one thing, but many.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006630/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006630<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>expressives, ideophones, georgian, kartvelian, nakh-daghestanian, abkhaz-adyghean, morphology, exponence, grammatical categories, language typology, syntax, phonology, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006630/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>257 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006630">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006630">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
