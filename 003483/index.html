Furthermore, there is a growing consensus that more than one structural element can be the source of the valued features, and that the struc- turally higher element tends to be responsible for the semantically informed value (for instance, √ and n in Kramer 2009, see Pesetsky 2013 and Landau 2016 for related configurational analyses). Yet it is far from clear what it means for fea- tures to be valued from the ‘context,’ and why the structural height of functional heads should make a difference with respect to whether or not a syntactic feature is going to be semantically interpreted.
This paper brings into the debate new data from Standard Italian and uses it to argue for a novel treatment of semantically interpretable φ-features, specifically gender. The Standard Italian nominal system morphologically marks two distinct genders, three distinct nominal classes (idiosyncratic nominal endings), and two numbers, a combination which lends itself to a theoretical investigation of com- plex gender interactions. Crucially, Italian nominal inflection also distinguishes between grammatical, i.e., idiosyncratic, and natural, i.e., context-dependent, gender. The main empirical focus of the paper is on names of professions that exhibit morpho-syntactically varied behavior: for some speakers, the root chirurg- ‘sur- geon’ can denote a female even if it is grammatically masculine (il chirurgo ‘the.M surgeon’1), while other speakers prefer a derived form with a distinct morpholog- ical feminine marker, be it a feminine determiner, or a combination of a feminine determiner and a feminine ending on the noun (la chirurgo ‘the.F surgeon’ vs la chirurg-a ‘the.F surgeon-F). Some nouns, such as avvocato ‘lawyer,’ have the same range of the formal variation, even though there is a designated feminine de- rived noun (avvocatessa ‘female lawyer’). The structural variability in turn allows us to investigate the timing of related syntactic operations and their interactions in a controlled way.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003483/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003483<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Inquiry</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phi-features. syntax-semantics interface, interpretability, agree, agreement, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003483/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1209 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003483">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003483">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
