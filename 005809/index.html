Jiménez-Fernández</a><br/>March 2021</center>&nbsp;<p></p>This paper discusses root phenomena in imperative clauses, assuming
as diagnostics conversational dynamics and the type of discourse categories that
are admitted in their C-domain, through a systematic comparative interface
investigation in three languages (English, Italian and Spanish) based on an
original experimental work. This novel perspective sheds new light on the syntaxsemantic
mapping and the interface (syntax-prosody) properties of imperative
clauses, embedding the relevant proposal in a cartographic framework of
analysis. Based on a twofold distinction of root phenomena – those which are
widely allowed in Common Ground-active (Type I) contexts and those which can
occur in non-Common Ground-active contexts (Type II) – it is proposed that
imperatives are non-Common Ground-active propositions with no update
potential, thus allowing only Type II root phenomena. Syntactically, imperative
clauses are dominated by a super-ordinate Speech Act Phrase, including the
SPEAKER and the ADDRESSEE as co-arguments, which explains the blocking effects
identified in imperatives.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005809/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005809<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Studia Linguistica</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>imperatives, types of topics, types of foci, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>337 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005809">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005809">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
