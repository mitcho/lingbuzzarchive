As such they must somehow access the force projection. This study investigates the German particle denn which appears in questions. First the position of denn with respect to other particles and higher adverbs is determined. Then it is shown that whenever denn appears in a dependent clause its interpretable feature must be picked up by an interrogative operator, a situation which permits recursive embedding of denn. It is finally shown that in Bavarian denn appears as the clitic -n. In wh-clauses, this clitic has two exceptional and obviously interrelated properties: it is (a) obligatory and (b) deprived of the semantics of denn. Denn has reached in this case an end point of grammaticalization by which it acts as a pure interrogative marker.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000704/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000704<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>discourse particles, questions, clausal left periphery, cyclic movement, german, bavarian, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>931 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000704">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000704">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
