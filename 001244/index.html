There is another kind of agreement found in languages such as Souletin, a Basque dialect, that targets the hearer. I will look at this type of so-called allocutive agreement, and pursue two main issues. First, although it targets the hearer, the form of the agreement is the same as the regular phi-feature agreement used for subject/object. This means that the allocutive agreement must be part of a probe-goal relation, leading to the question, where is the goal? I will argue that something like Rossâ€™s Performative Analysis furnishes the second-person goal. Second, the distribution of the allocutive agreement is essentially the same as the politeness marking on the verb in Japanese, which leads to the hypothesis that, despite Japanese being characterized as a typical agreementless language, the politeness marker is, in fact, an implementation of second-person agreement. Moreover, this allocutive agreement in Japanese has a distribution that limits it essentially to the root clause as defined by Emonds (1969).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001244/current.pdf?_s=54GBh2UxEOr0QnN3">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001244<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001244">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001244</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms., MIT</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agreement, basque, japanese, main clause phenomena, mcp, root, topicalization, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>243 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001244?_s=7TtcWJO2J-0oeUAC&amp;_k=SRVFpS2ft4oTu2P1&amp;2">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001244?_s=7TtcWJO2J-0oeUAC&amp;_k=SRVFpS2ft4oTu2P1&amp;3">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
