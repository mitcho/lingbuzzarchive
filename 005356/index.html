These sentences have the surface form that resembles identificational copular sentences (identificationals) with relative clause (RC) modifiers (e.g., "This is the house I mentioned") and clefted sentences (clefts) with demonstrative (DEM) subjects (e.g., "That was John that I saw"). Ever since Higgins’s (1973) seminal work, English copular sentences have received much attention in the literature (see, e.g., Hedberg 2000, Mikkelsen 2011, Moltmann 2013, Reeve 2011, and the references there), but sentences like "That’s a beautiful dress you’re wearing" have not been part of that discussion. In this squib, I show how these sentences are both similar and dissimilar to identificationals and clefts, and suggest a formal analysis that may capture their characteristic properties. The upshot of the analysis will be that these sentences are affective identificationals whose DEM subject denotes the object of direct perception which the RC appositively modifies, and the postcopular nominal (XP) indicates what is noteworthy about it. In terms of syntax, I propose that DEM and the RC initially occur inside the same nominal projection but due to raising of DEM and XP to higher positions, XP and the RC end up forming what I call a Focus Phrase (FocP), and this yields an ostensibly extraposed structure. What I propose will turn out to be reminiscent of what is referred to as the discontinuous constituent approach to clefts such as Akmajian 1970, Percus 1997, Hedberg 2000, and Reeve 2011, but I do not resort to extraposition though I will treat DEM in sentences like "That’s a beautiful dress you’re wearing" as a disguised definite description. The proposed analysis will also be similar in spirit to Han and Hedberg 2008, which attempts to capture the insights of both discontinuous constituent (e.g., Jespersen 1927, Percus 1997, Hedberg 2000) and expletive analyses of clefts (e.g., Jespersen 1937, Chomsky 1977, Delahunty 1982, Heggie 1988, É. Kiss 1998), but again, details will differ, as will be shown in section 3. The paper ends by briefly discussing implications for the study of crosslinguistic variation in copular sentences and DEM semantics.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005356/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005356<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Linguistic Inquiry</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>copular sentences, clefts, identificationals, demonstratives, affective, focus, relative clauses, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005356/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>165 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005356">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005356">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
