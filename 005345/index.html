I argue that the behavior of parasitic gaps in such configurations, when considered in the context of certain predictions from Nissenbaum (2000),  reveals evidence for the following generalization: If two A-bar moving phrases XP1 and XP2 form specifiers of an intermediate phase YP such that XP1 c-commands XP2, then XP1 c-commands XP2 in all subsequent positions these phrases occupy. I argue that this result is expected under a theory in which cross-phasal movement is constrained by cyclic phase-by-phase linearization and order preservation, and leads to interesting consequences for topics such as the path containment condition, and the formation of multiple specifier configurations. In particular, this work challenges the hypothesis of Richards (1997, a.o.) that the second of multiple movements to one head necessarily ``tucks-in".<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005345/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005345<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in proceedings of NELS 50</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, successive cyclicity, multiple specifiers, overlapping paths, parasitic gaps</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>308 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005345">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005345">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
