The ‘non-scalar’ and ‘scalar’ entries assert that all / all stronger focus alternatives to the prejacnet, p, in C are false. In contrast, the ‘hybrid’ entry (cf. Konig 1981, Guerzoni 2003) has a scalar presupposition requiring all alternatives to p in C to be stronger than p, and a classical non-scalar exclusive assertion, requiring all distinct alternatives in C to be false. We show that, in general the ‘hybrid’ entry is the only one which captures the long-standing intuition in the literature that only and even are some sorts of antonyms, and point out three more specific advantages of this entry: (A) The mirror imaged infelicity of only and even with some discourse salient material (e.g. A:John has 4 children. B: Bill even has 5/ #3 vs. Bill only has #5/3). We show that while the contrast with even is straightforwardly derived from its standard entry, the one with only can be only derived from the ‘hybrid’ entry  (B) New observations about contextual factors leading to disappearance of mirativity effects of only, which can be naturally explained using the ‘hybrid’ entry and (C) Reports about particles in various languages which pattern like even in terms of scalarity and like only in terms of exclusivity, and whose existence is predicted by the ‘hybrid’, much more than by the more commonly used ‘non-scalar’ or ‘scalar’ entries.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004278/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004278<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>NELS 49</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>even, only, focus, alternatives, mirativity, scalar presupposition, exclusive, additive, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>60 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004278">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004278">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
