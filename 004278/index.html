We propose that adopting this entry allows us to capture the long observed ‘scalar antonymy’ between ‘only’ and ‘even’ – where both particles have scalar presuppositions with universal force, requiring p to be weaker (in the case of only) /  stronger (in the case of even) than all other alternatives in C. Adopting this entry is also supported by  that fact that it does a better than the more popular ‘non-scalar‘ and ‘scalar’ entries in explaining the infelicity of ‘only’ where sentences weaker than p are salient in the discourse, and the fact that this infelicity is the mirror image of infelicity patterns with ‘even’. Importantly, however, unlike the ‘scalar ordering’ antonymy, we argue that ‘only’ and ‘even’ should not be considered ‘mirative’ /‘evaluative’ antonyms: While ‘even’ is indeed a real evaluative particle, presupposing that p (as well as its alternatives) indicates a degree which is higher than the salient standard on the relevant scale, apparent mirror-imaged evaluativity inferences of only (indicating a degree below expectations / the salient standard) should not hardwired into its entry, but are rather pragmatically derived from the universal quantification over alternatives and constraints on constructing C. Finally, we show that maintaining the universal quantification over alternatives in C in the scalar presuppositions of both ‘only’ and ‘even’ faces parallel challenges, and discuss some ways to handle them.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004278/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004278<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>NELS 49</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>even, only, focus, alternatives, mirativity, scalar presupposition, exclusive, additive, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004278/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>575 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004278">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004278">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
