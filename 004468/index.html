This ambiguity holds for the same native speakers, and no detectable difference in terms of the Tense – Agreement characteristics or the structural size can be found between infinitival constituents with PRO / DP subjects. To account for this phenomenon, I propose, first, to analyze mandative verbs as lexical realizations of a verb of communication that embeds a silent deontic modal head; the latter, in turn, takes a clausal proposition as its complement. Second, I demonstrate that the reported DP / PRO alternation is described by the following generalization: An embedded overt referential subject is allowed only when there is no potential dative DP controller available within a higher clause. In the spirit of the traditional Case theory, I argue that an embedded lexical subject must be Case licensed, and, since non-finite clauses are Case deficient, licensing may only be done by a higher (matrix) functional head, namely Appl, which normally introduces an obligation Holder; thus, matrix Holders and lexical embedded subjects end up competing to match features of the same functional head. Furthermore, I show that, as no subject-to-object raising happens, long-distance Case assignment proceeds over a CP boundary.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004468/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004468<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>object control, ecm, mandative verbs, covert modality, russian, syntax, pro, dp/pro alternation, case</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004468/v2.pdf">v2 [January 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004468/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>179 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004468">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004468">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
