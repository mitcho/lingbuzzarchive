A hypothesis was tested according to which children lent relatively more weight than adults to vowel formant transitions from the consonant, whereas adults used more the spectral characteristics of the frication noise (Nittrouer, Manning & Meyer, 1993). The sample was composed of adults and 4 and 7-year-old children. Two continua were synthesised for the minimal pair [a'ʃa] ‘to find’ and [a'sa] ‘to bake’ and for the contrast [ʃu]-[su]. Two auditory cues were manipulated: centre frequency of the frication noise and vowel formant transition. The results do not completely agree with the development pattern proposed by Nittrouer and colleagues. The cue weighting by both the 4-year-olds and 7-year-olds changed as a function of vowel and/or lexical status, which was not observed among the adults. In addition, the adults weighted the F2 transition more heavily than the noise frequency. The results of this study suggest that younger children who are native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese do not always weight more heavily the F2 transition to the classification of voiceless coronal fricatives.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001867/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001867<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted to JSHLR - yet unrevised!</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>cue weighting, speech perception, language development, brazilian portuguese, phonetics, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001867/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2013]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>751 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001867">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001867">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
