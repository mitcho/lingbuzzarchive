This will look at both features that lead to an aggregate increase in morphological complexity, such the decline of tmesis in preverbs and their ultimate grammaticalization onto the verb, allowing for the possibility of ‘trapped morphology’ in the terms of Harris and Faarlund (2006). While such processes result in a net increase of morphological complexity, there also exist countervailing declines in morphological complexity in other ways, such as with the loss of –(e)n plural number agreement. Then there are cases of ‘ambivalent’ grammaticalization, such as clitic agreement and aspectual-modality markers (=q’e, =mca, =dzi) which never quite ‘made it’, as well as various phonological changes in dialects which have had some rather serious knock-on effects to verb morphology. Georgian verbal morphology will be seen to be not a fixed unchanging template, but a kaleidoscope of multisystemic, ongoing morphological change.
