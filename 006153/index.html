As an alternative to the universalist and phrase-structure approach championed by Mainstream Generative Grammar, I argue that part of the interpretive constraints on individual pronoun forms should be captured by language-specific constructions specifying well-formed correspondences between particular arrangements of grammatical functions and bound variable structures in semantics, incorporating the core insights of Reinhart and Reuland’s (1993) reflexivity-and-chains theory into a non- derivational setting. Other interpretive constraints come from non-syntactic factors related to discourse perspective (SELLS, 1987) and principles of pragmatic inference drawn from Horn’s (1985) neo-Gricean theory. Since the constructional approach reduces general principles of grammar to properties of the lexicon, it allows for the full-range of diversity found in anaphoric systems across the world’s languages. The sources of universals are mostly confined to semantics (notions like reflexivity and variable binding), the vocabulary of grammatical functions (notions like syntactic predicate and GF-command), the learning procedures (e.g. statistical preemption) and domain-general pragmatic principles. Though this thesis focuses mostly on the micro-variation among Germanic and Romance languages, the framework developed here naturally accounts for the fact that different languages may express the universal semantic category of reflexivity by radically different syntactic means. The idea that constructions are violable (with violation possibly giving rise to marked meanings as Manner implicatures) is also a useful addition to the constructional stance, since it helps to account for the diverse behavior of specific pronoun forms within an individual language as well. Exploring this latter conjecture, I propose English long-distance reflexives violate grammatical conditions, but may become acceptable in virtue of the fact that a logophoric interpretation emerges as an implicature (MENUZZI 1999, 2004). I argue that the logophoricity implicature only emerges in contexts where the core construction associated with English coargument reflexives has no way of being felicitously fulfilled. I also propose to reduce the syntactic effects of Condition B of the Binding Theory to a constructional property, which has to be overtly acquired by language learners and may vary from language to language. By doing so, my theory explains why many languages simply lack a syntactic anti-locality principle for pronominals of the kind seen in English. As I show, this is what we find in certain southeastern dialects of Brazilian Portuguese. The kind of anti-locality effect we see for pronominals in these varieties is best understood as a consequence of a pragmatic principle that associates unmarked forms with unmarked meanings (HORN, 1985; RETT, 2020). The common thread that runs through most of the arguments in this thesis is the goal of making the theoretical account of pronouns (in English and other languages) as simple as possible.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006153/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006153<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>anaphora, reflexives, pronouns, pronominals, binding theory, coreference, referential dependencies, simpler syntax, anaphors, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>720 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006153">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006153">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
