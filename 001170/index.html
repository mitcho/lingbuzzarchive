A relative element in one clause must obligatorily refer to a non clausemate antecedent. Because Korean relative kes cannot successfully adjoin to its head, it is either deleted, yielding what is classified as an EHRC, or remains in situ in a structure similar to a matrix clause in English, known as an IHRC. Multiple readings in the latter, which arise because the relative is a pronoun, as opposed to an anaphor, are often hindered by a vector effect and the very nature of the representation. Along the way, it is argued that the so-called case-markers are in fact a type of referring elements, named thematic pronouns, making up a symbiosis with their argument. This analysis has considerable interests elsewhere in Korean grammar and suchlike languages.
