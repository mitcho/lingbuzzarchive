Regarding event-internal modifiers, such as comitatives and instrumentals, different, but class-based base positions have been proposed by Frey & Pittner (1998), and Maienborn (2001), among others. In this paper, we argue that serialization constraints on event-internal adverbials should not be formulated in terms of class-based (intrinsic) properties, but in terms of extrinsic properties, such as Anaphoricity, and Thematic Integration, which apply to the modifiers. In two experimental studies, we have been able to show that serializations of event-internal modifiers are more complex than envisaged in prior analyses, which do not take lexical variation into account. By relying on extrinsic properties to determine word order constraints, a more parsimonious analysis can be proposed. This analysis eliminates the need to postulate two different constraint systems for complements and adjuncts to determine word order regularities in the German Mittelfeld (at least for event-internal modifiers). 


The current version also contains a link to a github repository, where the experimental data and models can be found.


This is now version 2.0 of the paper. The most important change is that the paper now reflects newly developed random slope models for both experiments, which gauge the by-subject variability for each condition. The new structure of the models is discussed in section 4, 4.4.3 in particular. In addition, we have added a brief comment on issues pointed out to us by Hubert Haider (for which we are thankful) in section 5 (fn 13). Of course, typos and other minor issues have been changed. 


The models described in this paper can be found in the same github repository, now under release v2.0.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006319/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006319<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted for publication</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>german, adverbial modification, event-internal adverbials, syntax-semantics interface, experimental syntax, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006319/v2.pdf">v2 [November 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006319/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>584 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006319">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006319">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
