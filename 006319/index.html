A major division can be drawn between analyses proposing base positions dependent on class membership, and analyses allowing free generation of adverbials unless adverbials from different classes modify the same event. Based on two experimental studies on event-internal modifiers we present an analysis which rejects base positions, as well as free generation of adverbials in isolation. 
The results indicate that event-internal modifiers occupy several positions in German clause structure. Adverbials are base generated but constrained by a structural condition together with linear precedence rules based on a ranking of thematic roles, animacy, and the category of the phrase. Event-internal adverbials combine with a verbal projection (identifying the respective event variables) but require the identification of an additional individual variable with its reference phrase. Affirmative interpretations differ from privative ones, in that only the former introduce thematic roles. Hence, linearization constraints based on thematic hierarchies will only apply to affirmative modifiers, while the other constraints apply to affirmative and privative event-internal modifiers, yielding different serializations for affirmative and privative event-internal modifiers.



This is now version 3.0 of the paper, the result of a review process and a very major revision, which led to a completely new paper. As with the prior versions, you can find all data from the experimental studies as well as the analyses in an accompanying github repository.


Somehow, we messed up the formatting of version 3.0 as a PDF. So here is a new version, identical in text, but formatted differently.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006319/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006319<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted for publication</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>german, adverbial modification, event-internal adverbials, syntax-semantics interface, experimental syntax, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006319/v4.pdf">v4 [October 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006319/v3.pdf">v3 [January 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006319/v2.pdf">v2 [November 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006319/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1259 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006319">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006319">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
