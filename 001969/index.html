Using openly available corpora, we answer two questions systematically: firstly whether the size of an active lexicon of a speaker/community remains constant, and secondly, whether the productivity of the regular verbal forms in the first
conjugation -ar(e) increases over time and is a function of verb vocabulary size. By running random sampling simulations on both large and small corpora from different sources for each language, we found a consistent increase, especially after 1750, in both verb vocabulary size and productivity of the regular verbal form -ar(e). The results suggested that productivity of the
regular verbal form is likely to be caused by the increase in verb vocabulary size, and as more new verbs come into a language, they will most likely fall into the first conjugation. This increase in the ratio of new verbs being assigned to the first conjugation caused the irregular forms in the second
and third conjugations -er(e) and -ir(e) to become less productive over time. Finally, we speculate that the 1750 shift across all corpora is possibly caused by the industrial revolution which started around 1760.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001969/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001969<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>UCL Working Papers in Linguistics (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychlangsci/research/linguistics/publications/uclwpl25/)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>historical linguistics, productivity, irregular verbs, romance languages, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>774 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001969">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001969">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
