While both types of focus are claimed here to be identificational, they differ in that information focus incorporates a weaker relationship between the set of individuals identified and the relevant set of elements in the discourse available to both speaker and hearer. In a reexamination of focus domains in Hungarian, a focus-sensitive language, it is shown that they have been taken to be too restrictive and too broad at the same time: a number of syntactic constituents previously disqualified can be interpreted as focussed provided both syntactic and prosodic factors are taken into consideration, while others prove to be focussable only as parts of larger syntactic and semantic units.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000551/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000551<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Valéria Molnár and Susanne Winkler (eds.), The architecture of focus, Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin  New York, 2006, 137-168</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>focus, contrastive focus, domains (of focus), identification, information focus, gottlob frege, denotations, referring expressions, subset, proper subset; focus on arguments, adjuncts, predicates, dps, clauses., syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>245 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000551">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000551">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
