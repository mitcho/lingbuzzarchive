Previous studies have shown that both mutation and reduplication can be understood as purely phonological operations in response to defective segmental and prosodic material. Cases of over- and underapplication in reduplicated structures, however, pose a serious challenge to phonological accounts and are apparently better handled by non-modular approaches that invoke morpheme-specific constraints or construction-specific cophonologies. The main goal of this dissertation is to show that a phonological account of over- and underapplication of segmental mutation is not only feasible but that seemingly opaque interactions are in fact predicted by mixed representational-serial approaches. Following the broad research program of Generalized Non-Linear Affixation, and assuming a modular feed-forward architecture of grammar, I demonstrate how apparent cases of overapplication (including ``backcopying'') follow from the interplay of markedness conspiracies, copying of non-minimal prosodic domains, and phonological stratification. Underapplication, on the other hand, emerges from a shortage of mutation triggers, either due to excessive underspecification or as a direct consequence of minimal copying. In addition, I offer reanalyses of purported cases of suppletive allomorphy in reduplication in terms of complex, yet fully transparent segmental phonological alternations. The dissertation thus strengthens the general argument for item-based approaches to non-concatenative morphology and advocates a strictly modular architecture as an alternative to lexical indexation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004090/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004090<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD thesis, Universit√§t Leipzig</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>reduplication, mutation, optimality theory, stratal ot, opacity, overapplication, underapplication, cyclicity, non-linear affixation, morphology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004090/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1497 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004090">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004090">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
