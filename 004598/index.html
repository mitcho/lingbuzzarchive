and French. Pancake sentences are copular sentences built with a (postcopular) adjective,
but differ from run-of-the-mill copular sentences in two respects: (i) the nominal expression in the
subject position, which is individual-denoting in its literal meaning, is reinterpreted as an event type
involving the original referent; (ii) there is agreement mismatch between this nominal expression
in subject position and the adjective. Following Greenberg (2008), we propose that in Brazilian
Portuguese and in French, it is the agreement feature mismatch which triggers the reinterpretation
mechanism of the nominal expression, which stands for a non-overt semantic structure. However,
the exact output of the reinterpretation mechanism (and the meaning of the covert semantic structure
the nominal expression stands for) depends on the building blocks of a non-agreeing copular
sentence, which are different in the two languages under discussion. These differences explain
why French non-agreeing copular sentences may have more than one meaning and are thus not
necessarily pancake sentences. We also observe that in general, only predicates of personal taste
are licensed in pancake sentences in the languages under discussion, which we also account for.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004598/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004598<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pancake sentences, brazilian portuguese, french, experiencer adjectives, bare nouns, predicates of personal taste, second-order property, agreement mismatch, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004598/v2.pdf">v2 [April 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004598/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>634 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004598">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004598">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
