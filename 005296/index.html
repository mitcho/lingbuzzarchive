The different meanings of the suffix -CIk are due to two different structures that I propose.  While the structure of the diminutive is made of one single morpheme -CIk, that of the augmentative suffix is composed of two morphemes: -CI and -k. I offer phonotactic and morphological evidence that shows -k has its own life. I also show strict categorical selection properties for the diminutive and augmentative suffix: The augmentative one can only be attached to adjectival bases that express negative orderings. The diminutive -CIk, on the other hand, attaches to nouns. I capture this contrast using the nanosyntax model of spellout.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005296/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005296<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of TU+5</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>adjective, augmentative, scalar, gradability, nanosyntax, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>293 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005296">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005296">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
