This paper deals with a concrete case, namely the analysis of the present tense agreement paradigm of Standard Dutch. Many possible analyses can and have been proposed to capture two basic facts: (i) the distribution of three distinct affixes accross the paradigm space and (ii) the fact that in 2sg contexts the -t is dropped in inversion orders.

A look at the straight and inversion order paradigms of agreement inflection in 267 varieties of Dutch reveals the existence of four exceptionless generalizations on paradigm structure. Under the assumption that these generalizations act as restrictions on the variation space, probably brought in through the process of language acquisition, the number of possible analyses for a single synchronic paradigm, including the standard Dutch one, is drastically reduced. We provide the first analysis of the Standard Dutch agreement paradigm that is compatible with these restrictions. In addition, we claim that two different types of inversion morphology can be theoretically as well as empirically distinguished.
