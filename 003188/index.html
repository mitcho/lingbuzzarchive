We focus in particular on verbs. Using a corpus analysis, we first show that the distribution of syntactic structures and lexical items that a verb occurs with is more complex in some contexts (meal contexts) than in others (play contexts). This finding raises the question of whether meal contexts have more semantic information than play contexts. We address this question in a large-scale Human Simulation Paradigm experiment, where we show that the relationship between distributional complexity and semantic information is not direct. Rather, nonlinguistic contexts with less distributional complexity (e.g. play contexts) yield better learning when simulated learners have little information, and nonlinguistic contexts with greater distributional complexity (e.g. meal contexts) yield better learning when those learners have more information. Further, simulated learners are only able to take advantage of the information in the higher-complexity contexts if they have access to both syntactic and lexical information, while in contrast, those learners are able to take advantage of the information in the lower-complexity contexts even if they have access to only syntactic information. This provides evidence that `pure' syntactic bootstrapping is most useful in early coarse-grained verb-learning, while later verb-learning combines syntactic and lexical information to fine-tune verbs' semantic representations.
