Based on evidence from Coahuilteco---an extinct language isolate formerly spoken in southwest Texas---I suggest that maximal projections may enter into Agree. Coahuilteco exhibits an unusual pattern of subject-object concord, in which internal arguments consistently inflect based on the phi-features of the external argument. This can receive a simple explanation as a case of the sharing of phi-features between subject and object under Agree, provided maximal projections may serve both as probes and goals. I show that this marker is indeed a morpheme which attaches to the object, and argue against a possible alternative in which a mediating functional head in the verbal complex is responsible for the transmission of phi-features from the subject to object. If correct, this analysis has a number of implications for syntactic theory more generally, some of which I highlight.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004579/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004579<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, agree, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>154 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004579">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004579">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
