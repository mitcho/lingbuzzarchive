Acquisition is then the process of selecting the correct grammar from that hypothesis space, based on language input. To compare KRs, we establish quantitative metrics based on an argument from acquisition that assess learnability from realistic acquisition data. We conduct a computational learnability analysis for three KRs proposed for metrical phonology and evaluate them on  English, a language that is notoriously irregular with respect to metrical phonology and therefore non-trivial to learn. We find that all three KRs have similar learnability potential, but the proposed English grammars within each KR are not the grammars able to account for the most English child input data, even if the learner has some knowledge of the interaction between English metrical phonology and morphology. This suggests learnability issues exist for the proposed English grammar in all three KRs if a learner is attempting to learn a grammar that accounts for as much of the input data as possible. We discuss which aspects of the proposed English grammars may be hurting learnability, observing that fairly small changes in parameter values or constraint-rankings may lead to significantly higher compatibility. We additionally discuss ways a learner may still be able to learn the English grammar from English input by incorporating (i) additional useful linguistic knowledge about English metrical phonology interactions and (ii) biases to selectively learn from the input.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002036/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002036<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Berkeley Linguistics Society Proceedings</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>metrical phonology, language acquisition, learnability, knowledge representation comparison, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>715 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002036">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002036">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
