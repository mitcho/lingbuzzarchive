It is argued that the (finite) complementizer that (and if) requires a propositional complement, thus a sentence with a lexicalized EPP. When the subject is absent, due to extraction, there is nothing to satisfy the EPP, and therefore the embedded clause does not qualify as the right complement for that (and if), triggering ungrammaticality (the that-t effect). On the other hand, (non-finite) to, akin to a locative subject, subsumes the EPP. The interpretation of the EPP in this case is that of variable, which may or may not be bound by a matrix DP (control, raising vs. arbitrary reading). The element for also requires a lexicalized EPP, hence the presence of a lexical DP which triggers an obviation effect. The present approach offers a novel way of approaching the properties of the subject in association with complementizers and (non-) finiteness (and vice versa).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000826/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000826<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Collected papers from the Conference on Edges, Cyprus</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>complementizer, subject extraction, that-t, control, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>207 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000826">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000826">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
