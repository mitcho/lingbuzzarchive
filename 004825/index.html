functional grounds in the literature. Much less is known, however, about the
cognitive differences between the two. The present article uses this
observation as a point of departure and investigates whether non-lexicalized
German adjective-noun compounds and phrases differ in how well they are
memorized. Crucially, the contribution goes beyond previous research on this
issue by (a) concentrating on the auditory presentation of compounds and
phrases within a single language that uses both types as a naming device, (b)
considering the role of prosodic prominence in the compound-phrase divide in
German, and (c) looking at non-lexicalized constructions either without or with
an explicitly given invented meaning. Two experiments are reported, in which
subjects were asked to memorize auditorily presented compounds and
phrases and participated in a response-time and response-accuracy
experiment. While the constructions were not associated with a specific and
explicitly given meaning in Experiment 1, they were in Experiment 2. The data
show that compounds are memorized more efficiently than phrases, both
without and with an explicitly given meaning, and independently from their
prosodic prominence pattern. It is argued that the effect derives from their
formal and functional characteristics.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004825/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004825<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Lingua</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>compound, phrase, prosodic prominence, memorization, mental lexicon, german, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>153 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004825">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004825">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
