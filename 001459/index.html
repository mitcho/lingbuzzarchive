For instance, Haugen (2009) and Mateu (2011) assume a special syntactic operation through which manner is syntactically generated, called conflation, in which manner is introduced by a root which externally merges with the verbal head by head adjunction. One (partial) exception to this tendency is found in Zubizarreta and Oh (2007), who treat the manner component in languages like Korean as a structural complex headed by a lexical verb, which enters a serial verb construction with another verb. This paper offers a series of arguments in favor of the view that the manner component universally presents a bare unergative VP. A consequence is that syntactic explanations for the behavior of manner-expressing verbs have to be formulated in a different way, which does not crucially rely on the atomic status of manner. The paper argues that the model that Zubizarreta & Oh (2007) designed for Korean, involving a verb with a complement adjoined to the lexical verb, is also the correct analysis for the observed phenomena in the Indo-European type of languages, and perhaps even a universal model of manner-expressing verbs.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001459/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001459<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001459">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001459</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>manner-expressing verbs, manner incorporation, verb prefixation, cognate objects, serbo-croatian, conflation, manner-result complementarity, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>328 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001459">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001459">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
