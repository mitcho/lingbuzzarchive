Similarly, topic drop is solely responsible for the missing object in Hebrew structures which have been argued to involve VP-ellipsis or a moved null operator. We outline the properties of topic drop and show that these same properties pertain in the constructions in question. We argue against movement analyses of both constructions and show that the only trigger for deletion is the topichood of the missing object. Our purpose is to show that topichood plays a critical role in ellipsis in those languages which independently allow for topic drop. From the fact that topic drop is constrained differently in the two languages we discuss, as well as in other languages that have been studied, we conclude that topic drop is a PF-interface phenomenon.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001253/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001253<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>topic-drop, vp ellipsis, parasitic gaps, russian, hebrew, differential object marking, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001253/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2011]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1312 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001253">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001253">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
