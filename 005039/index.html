The first is that the CIA is untenable since input-divergent analyses that occur during L1A must survive into adulthood. While everyone agrees children make input-divergent analyses in the process of learning, critics of the CIA argue these resolve prior to a time when diffusion is possible (adulthood; e.g. Traugott and Dasher 2005; Diessel 2012: 1600). In Section 2.2, I respond to this criticism by drawing attention to bodies of evidence for (a) peer-to-peer acquisition throughout childhood, (b) bilingual and heritage language effects on L1A that prolong input-divergent analyses, and (c) longstanding sociolinguistic evidence that the
teenage years are most relevant for the spread of innovations (as well as evidence that even pre-adolescent children likely participate in advancing sociolinguistic changes). 

The second common criticism comes from the assumption that parallels must hold
between child innovations and diachronic innovations (‘ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny’)
in order for the CIA to hold. We see parallel alignments in some domains (e.g. morphological regularization, semantic extensions), but not others (constructional reanalysis, as from biclausal structures to monoclausal, the development of agreement markers from pronouns). The heterogeneity of alignments between L1A pathways and diachronic pathways across linguistic domains is taken to be evidence against the CIA (e.g. Diessel 2012). In Section 2.3, I argue that the CIA does not predict that the L1A process should mimic completed diachronic changes. Rather, the CIA predicts that contemporary children make input-divergent analyses that advance diachronic cycles (which we can look back on in the future).2 In an effort to capture why semantic changes show parallels but morphosyntactic ones do not, I formulate the child language predictions of the CIA in terms of the mapping problem(see also Cournane
2014). The mapping problem is a primary problem in L1A, referring to how children learn which linguistic forms to associate with which meanings (entities, events, properties, etc.; see E. Clark 1977, 1993; Gleitman 1990; Bloom2000). Broadly, parallel alignments occur when the child posits a new meaning for an extant form(e.g. overextension), while oppositional alignments occur when the child posits a new form for an extant meaning (parsimonious or conservative structure postulation). This approach stresses that different necessary processes in typical L1A give rise to different types of innovations.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005039/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005039<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In Mathieu, Éric and Robert Truswell (eds), Microchange and Macrochange in Diachronic Syntax.
