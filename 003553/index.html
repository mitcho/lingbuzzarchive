All three conceivable stances on this matter, which are that (i) all parentheticals are syntactically integrated, (ii) all parentheticals are syntactic orphans, and (iii) some parentheticals are integrated but others are orphans, have been defended.  One class of parentheticals that has received much recent attention with regards to this issue is appositive relative clauses (ARCs).
	In support of a more general integrational view, Griffiths & De Vries (2013, henceforth G&dV) offer an additional specific argument in favour of treating ARCs as syntactically integrated into their hosts. This argument revolves arounds the distribution of ARCs in clausal ellipsis environments. In a recent reply to G&dV, Ott (2016) counters this specific argument, discards the more general integration analysis adopted by G&dV on conceptual grounds, and contends that an orphanage analysis of ARCs provides a more parsimonious explanation for the data that G&dV introduce.
	In this more elaborate rejoinder to Ott’s (2016) reply, we demonstrate that, while Ott presents some relevant data and provides welcome discussion, his specific counterargument to G&dV does not withstand scrutiny. More importantly, we also defend the integration approach to ARCs (and to parenthesis more generally) on conceptual and empirical grounds. In particular we wish to stress that, if one given implementation of the integration analysis exhibits shortcomings, this does not logically imply that parentheticals must be orphans. Indeed, we will demonstrate that recent research on the ‘syntacticisation’ of speech acts engenders an integration analysis that does not exhibit the conceptual deficiency that Ott attributes to G&dV’s analysis. Lastly, we examine the orphanage analysis of ARCs and argue that such an approach has conceptual and empirical inadequacies that no integration approach exhibits.
