It is shown that (if phonology and phonetics are indeed two distinct modules), phonetic arbitrariness is a necessary consequence of modularity: anyone who subscribes to modularity must also endorse phonetic arbitrariness. In turn, phonetic arbitrariness necessarily entails substance-free melodic primes, i.e. ones that bear no phonetic information in the phonology (pace Hale and Reiss where primes come with phonetic labels such as [labial], [coronal] etc.). It is only when both melodic primes and phonological computation are substance-free (with Hale and Reiss only the latter is) that phonology is self-contained in the Saussurian sense. Another issue discussed is how phonetic arbitrariness relates to the question whether melodic primes are universal and innate or language-specific and emergent (if you subscribe to phonetic arbitrariness, your primes are necessarily substance-free and emergent, but if you are committed to emergent primes they may be either substance-free or substance-laden). Finally, it is shown that a fully substance-free approach is a radical departure from current systems on the conceptual side, but does not change anything in the every-day practice of phonologists, who may happily continue to use the familiar substantive vocabulary when talking about sound patterns: these are simply shorthand for the true phonological structure where substance is absent and only comes in upon spell-out, just like chemists talk about water when they mean the real chemical object H2O.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004554/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004554<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Phonological Studies (Japan)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>substance-free primes, features, elements, emergent features, phonetics-phonology mapping, arbitrariness, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004554/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>169 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004554">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004554">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
