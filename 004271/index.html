We argue that the reduplication takes place when a categoryless root is merged with a null nominal categorizer which copies the phonological matrix of the root. There is a condition on word formation, maybe universal but certainly applying to Chinese, that a content word must consist of at least two constituents. A root merged with a categorizer satisfies this condition. In Xining Chinese the condition on nouns is that they have to consist of minimally two pronounced constituents. When the condition is not independently satisfied, as in a compound or affixed noun, reduplication is how the condition is met. In conjunction with a minimalist theory of word formation, this will be shown to predict the distribution of reduplication in various contexts. For instance, the head of a compound can be reduplicated, but not the modifier, some affixes but not others permit reduplication of the base, non-compositional compounds do not allow any reduplication, and so called ‘bound roots’ (really, bound words) are not reduplicated. The phenomenon provides very strong evidence that simple content words are made up of categoryless root and a categorizer which is often null, but can be overt in some languages, including Xining Chinese.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004271/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004271<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Forthcoming in Proceedings of the Olomouc Linguistics Colloquium</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>root, merge, compound, reduplication, chinese, bound word, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>184 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004271">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004271">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
