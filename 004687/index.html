There’s much naturally-occurring variation in children’s input, but not all variation is developmentally meaningful – that is, variation that qualitatively impacts language development. While there are observed differences in input quantity and quality across socio-economic status (SES), it’s unclear how often these input differences are developmentally meaningful. We describe a new way to identify developmentally-meaningful input differences that harnesses developmental computational modeling, which allows us to identify which aspects of the input are used by children to learn specific linguistic knowledge. We then investigate if there’s developmentally-meaningful input variation across SES with respect to the complex syntactic knowledge called syntactic islands, which is used to form grammatical wh-questions.

Using quantitative analysis and cognitive modeling to assess low-SES child-directed speech samples, we find that the relevant data for learning about syntactic islands in low-SES children’s input are quantitatively and qualitatively similar to those of high-SES children. In particular, low- SES children’s input is predicted to also allow successful acquisition of syntactic island knowledge. Interestingly, at least one key building block for syntactic island knowledge comes from a different source in low-SES children’s input, but is crucially still present. This highlights an important qualitative input similarity across SES. Our results suggest that the linguistic evidence for more complex syntactic knowledge like syntactic islands, in contrast with more foundational linguistic knowledge, may not differ by SES. We discuss implications for linguistic development and adult syntactic knowledge variability across SES.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004687/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004687<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>socioeconomic status, linguistic development, child-directed speech, syntactic islands constraints, computational modeling, quantitative approaches, input quantity, input quality, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004687/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>267 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004687">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004687">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
