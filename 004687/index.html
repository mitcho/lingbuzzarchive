We investigate wh-dependency constraints, known as syntactic islands, as a concrete case of complex syntactic knowledge where the quantity and quality of high-SES CDS has been previously assessed. Using quantitative analysis and cognitive modeling to assess low-SES CDS samples, we find that the wh-dependencies in low-SES children’s complex syntactic input are quantitatively and qualitatively similar to those of high-SES children. In particular, the wh-dependencies (i) have similar distributions across SES, and (ii) would allow successful acquisition of syntactic island knowledge. Interestingly, at least one key building block for syntactic island knowledge comes from a different source in low-SES children’s input, but is crucially still present. This highlights an important qualitative similarity across SES. Our results suggest that the linguistic evidence for more complex syntactic knowledge like syntactic islands, in contrast with more foundational linguistic knowledge, may not differ by SES. We discuss implications for linguistic development and adult syntactic knowledge variability across SES.
