For example, in 'John is very lucky', John is taken to be lucky to a high degree. However, a number of degree expressions allow a second interpretation, which seems to ascribe a property to a proportion of the subject, rather than to the subject as a whole. Thus, 'the steak is half cooked' is ambiguous between having a regular ‘quality’ interpretation, on which the whole steak is halfway through the cooking process, and a ‘quantity’ reading, on which half of the steak is fully cooked. In this paper, we explore this ambiguity and argue that its source lies in a null operator optionally attached in the extended projection of the adjective prior to the degree expression being merged.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002741/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002741<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>UCL</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>degree expressions, part-whole relationship, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1103 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002741">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002741">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
