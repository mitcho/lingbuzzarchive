analysis of coordination in categorial grammar (CG), of the sort
defended in detail by Kubota and Levine (2015) and whose key
insights go back to proposals by Steedman (1985) and Dowty (1988)
in the 80s, is inadequate on empirical grounds. Of the three
pieces of evidence they offer, facts about the so-called
'summative agreement' phenomenon seems at first sight to be the
strongest possible candidate for a real problem for the CG
approach. In this short paper, we critically assess the argument
offered by Yatabe and Tam involving these summative agreement
facts, and argue that their refutation of the CG approach
critically rests on a particular assumption about morphological
number agreement and semantic plurality that can be shown to be
too simplistic on independent grounds. Once this assumption about
agreement is replaced by a more adequate analysis of the
relationship between semantic plurality and morphological number
agreement that is in line with the standard assumptions in the
contemporary formal semantics literature, summative agreement
facts are no longer problematic for the CG approach. Based on
this discussion, we conclude that the CG approach still remains
to be the simplest and empirically most robust analysis of the
coordination facts in English.
