This paper presents arguments that contrary to the standard view, topics in Japanese, contrastive or non-contrastive, must occupy clause-initial position. Evidence comes from examining the syntactic and interpretive properties of both types of wa-marked phrases in various discourse contexts. First, a tonally prominent wa-phrase must move to clause-initial position in contexts that require a contrastive topic. Second, in contexts that allow a tonally prominent wa-phrase to remain in situ, the relevant phrase is not interpreted as a topic and cannot move to clause-initial position. Third, tonally prominent wa-phrases displaced to clause-initial position show the syntactic distribution of topics which are predicted by considerations at the syntax-information structure interface, but those in situ do not. Finally, despite the general consensus, there are limited circumstances in which tonally non-prominent wa-phrases can occupy a non-initial position. The article presents syntactic and interpretive evidence that such wa-phrases are also not topics.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001433/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001433<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001433">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001433</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in The Lingusitic Review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>contrast, information structure, japanese, syntax, topic, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>211 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001433">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001433">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
