We provide a decompositional analysis in which same and different consist of a (non-)identity operator and a presuppositional element TOO. On this account, the distinction between external and internal readings emerges as the familiar difference between binding and accommodation of presuppositions. The parallelism effects observed in Hardt and Mikkelsen (2015) are also shown to arise from the interaction of the additive presupposition with scopal ambiguities of same and different. Several additional observations are accounted for, including island sensitivity of same and different, as well as aspects of their distribution and interpretation in comparative constructions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007718/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007718<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Linguistics and Philosophy</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>presupposition, identity, non-identity, scope, decomposition, comparatives, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007718/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2023]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>391 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007718">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007718">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
