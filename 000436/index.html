Part one will go on to explain that this constraint is actually nothing other than a straightforward Empty Category Principle violation although due to its specific location within the domain (final) other factors are involved, such as the word-final parameter. Part one shows that different languages behave in one of two different ways in repairing this specific ECP violation and as such these strategies can be parametised. 



 Part two shows the diachronic changes in Lhasa Tibetan and Maremmano Italian as regards word-final segmentally-empty syllabic structure. These languages historically show the loss of segmental material although retaining its syllabic structure. It is also shown, following the UG tradition,  that totally disparate languages can behave identically with regard their repair strategies.



Part three then shows how the utterance-final empty structure interacts with elements placed after it within their domain. Theoretically speaking this has the effect of taking our ECP violation away from domain-final to domain-medial position. What we would expect is that Maremmano Italian and Lhasa Tibetan, two languages which behave identically domain finally, would react the same way to similar circumstances. This however isnt borne out in the facts and in Maremmano Italian the ECP violation repair strategy is Raddoppiamento Sintattico , while in Lhasa Tibetan it is Compensatory Lengthening. The data shows us that to properly parametise the repair strategies we must have a differentiation between domain-final and domain-medial applications. These two locations for the same parameter are independent of each other and so if Maremmano Italian and Lhasa Tibetan select for the same setting domain-finally they can (as we will see) select a different setting domain-medially.



Having re-defined the parameters responsible for the repair strategies which superficially we call RS and CL there is an obvious port of call. Lowenstamm (1999) claims that RS and CL in Biblical Hebrew are motivated not by word-final diachronically visible segmental loss and syllabic retention rather by an empty ON-pair (for him CV-site) located word-initially. This, he argues, is universal. This study then goes to show that Lowenstamms rules for generating RS and CL with only one CV-site doesnt output the correct data (as found still within Lowenstamm (1999)). The justifications for his structure and outputs are shown to be falsified a priori. Part four will then go on to show that actually the CV-site is essential to Biblical Hebrew RS and CL but that one CV-site is not enough. Through diachronic segmental loss and syllabic retention however, we can propose that the RS and CL trigger ha being originally *han provides us with justification for a word-final empty-ON pair just as with the Maremmano Italian and Lhasa Tibetan. With this studys  word-final empty structure and Lowenstamms (1999) initial CV-site it is possible to output the correct data (in Lowenstamm 1999).



The initial-CV site is important to understand Biblical Hebrew and supposedly universal, at least within languages with real consonant clusters (Kula 2006), so Lhasa Tibetan is immune to the following question: why doesnt Maremmano Italian, supposedly a branching onset language, behave like Biblical Hebrew. If Kula (2006) is right we could understand this problem by Maremmano Italian not having true branching onsets and thus not requiring a word-initial CV-site. This would still leave  us with the empty word-final structure and the correct outputs. To back up this radical position, there is lenition evidence proving this hypothesis exactly correct. Branching onsets in Maremmano Italian are most probably best analysed as bogus clusters seen that,  in post-vocalic lenition, the supposed governor reduces to a lower elemental complexity than its supposed governee thus violating the complexity condition of government (a pivotal notion in Government Phonology to account for branching onset typology (Kaye et al. 1985; Charette 1990, Harris 1990)) .<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000436/current.doc">doc</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000436<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>ms.
