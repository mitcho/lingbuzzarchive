However, most previous work has focused on how discontinuous agreement is generated and has relied on data from verbs with relatively basic tense, aspect and mood.  In this paper, I investigate a different kind of discontinuous agreement puzzle in an atypical kind of verb, namely, why and how the agreement prefix (but not the agreement suffix) is lacking from imperative verbs in Amharic.  I argue that the agreement prefix undergoes morphological haplology because it repeats the second person features found in the imperative head. I then demonstrate how a haplology approach decides between two different analyses of discontinuous agreement: it furnishes evidence against a Linearization analysis (Harbour 2008a, 2016, this issue) and in favor of a Metathesis analysis (Hewett 2022, this issue).  Overall, this paper develops a novel approach to imperative inflection, supports a Metathesis approach to discontinuous agreement, and advances our understanding of morphological haplology.  <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007272/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007272<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Brill's Journal of Afroasiatic Languages and Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>morphology, syntax, imperative, agreement, amharic, distributed morphology, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007272/v2.pdf">v2 [May 2023]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/007272/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2023]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>642 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007272">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007272">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
