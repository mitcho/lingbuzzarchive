In the first experiment, it was tested whether subjects prefer a non-lexicalized compound (e.g., Kurzcouch, short_couch) or the respective non-lexicalized phrasal counterpart (e.g., kurze Couch, short couch) in order to express a novel complex lexical concept (e.g., It is a very specific couch that is 1.30 meters short because it is designed only for children up to this size.). In the second
test, subjects rated on a scale how well the compounds and phrases expressed the newly created concepts. The findings of the two studies support the idea that compounds are better naming candidates than phrases. It is claimed that the effect derives from the specific formal nature of compounds and has consequences on the processing and mental representation of the two construction types.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004824/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004824<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Word Structure</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>compound, phrase, naming unit, german, adjective-noun constructions, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>240 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004824">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004824">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
