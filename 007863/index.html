There are conflicting views about inclusive person: on the traditional view inclusives are a subcategory of first person, but there are disagreements about whether they result from realization of a privative feature or a binary contrast; on other views inclusive is its own separate category.

In this paper, I use evidence from patterns of syncretism, suppletion, and morphological relatedness to reevaluate claims about inclusives with a new pronominal database of 270 genetically and geographically diverse languages. I find support for the traditional view that inclusive is a type of first person. However, my findings go against recent approaches to morphological features based on privative contrasts that create containment relationships and predict the so-called *ABA-constraint (Bobaljik, 2012; Caha, 2009; Moskal, 2018). I show several examples of ABA patterns in the data, and no stark asymmetry between frequencies of inclusives derived from exclusives compared to the reverse situation. Both of these facts support the view that clusivity is due to a binary featural contrast. I propose a feature hierarchy that incorporates such a binary contrast and captures a number of facts about pronominal paradigms that go beyond patterns of clusivity.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007863/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007863<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Morphology</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>personal pronouns, exclusive/inclusive distinction, aba constraint, pronominal typology, morphological paradigms, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>133 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007863">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007863">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
