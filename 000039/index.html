Since it concerns possessive relatives primarily, an integrated approach to the syntax of relativization and attributive possession is sought for. Possessive relatives directly reflect the three basic types of attributive possession, namely the prepositional, the genitive and the possessive pronoun construction. It is claimed that the promotion theory of relative clauses can be succesfully combined with an analysis of possession in which the prepositional construction is taken to be the basis for the other types. Furthermore, it is shown that heavy pied piping is normally dependent on the presence of a prepositional phrase. In general, pied piping is claimed to be a possible consequence of overt or covert head movement. Finally, the effect of the so called R transformation on pied piping and preposition stranding in relative clauses is discussed. The different possibilities shown by English, Dutch and German are argued to be consequences of the theoretical possibilities of creating a syntactic relation, namely by XP movement, overt head movement, or covert movement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000039/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000039<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Comparative Germanic Linguistics 9 (2006)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>(attributive) possession, relative clauses, relative pronouns, syntax, pied piping, raising/promotion, preposition stranding, genitive</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>225 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000039">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000039">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
