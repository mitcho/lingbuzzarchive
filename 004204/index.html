These phenomena are often addressed together, since they rely on pitch movements, and clear-cut distinctions between them can be difficult to make. For instance, it is not always easy to determine if a high tone on a certain morpheme is best thought of as lexical tone, pitch-based stress (so-called lexical pitch accent), or part of the intonational make-up of a phrase. 
The languages discussed here include Abkhaz-Adyghean/North-West Caucasian (henceforth NWC), Nakh-Dagestanian/North-East Caucasian (NEC), Kartvelian/South-Caucasian (SC), and one of the larger Indo-European (IE) languages of the area, Ossetic (Iron and Digoron). Many of the issues related to tone and intonation in the languages of the Caucasus require extensive further research. The aim of this chapter, therefore, is to serve as a summary of the known facts and existing descriptions that can inform and encourage further investigations, both instrumental and theoretical.
