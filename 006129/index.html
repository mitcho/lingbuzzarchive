This hypothesis helps explain otherwise puzzling patterns concerning the distribution of various functional terms and phrases. Despite its promise, Logicality vastly over-generates unacceptability assignments. Most solutions to this problem rest on specific stipulations about the properties of logical form---roughly, the level of linguistic representation which feeds into the interpretation procedures---and have substantial implications for traditional philosophical disputes about the nature of language. Specifically, Contextualism and Semantic Minimalism, construed as competing hypothesis about the nature and degree of context-sensitivity at the level of logical form, suggest different approaches to the over-generation problem. In this paper, I explore the implications of pairing Logicality with various forms of Contextualism and Semantic Minimalism. I argue that, to adequately solve the over-generation problem, Logicality should be implemented in a constrained Contextualist framework. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006129/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006129<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Mind</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>logicality, contextualism, semantic minimalism, semantics vs. pragmatics, 17 natural logic, modularity, grammaticality, triviality, quantifiers, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>321 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006129">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006129">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
