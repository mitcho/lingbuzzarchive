In principle, these two phenomena are distinct, but in practice it can be difficult to distinguish them.  In this paper, I take up the issue for the Amharic object marker, a morpheme that covaries with the phi features of an internal argument.  Evidence from its distribution and morphological form indicate that it is a doubled clitic, but it also displays a handful of properties characteristic of agreement.  Building on some of the most recent clitic doubling research, I develop an Agree-based clitic doubling analysis of the object marker that accounts for both its doubled clitic-like and agreement-like properties.  Overall, the paper is a case study in how to distinguish clitic doubling and agreement in a particular language, and an investigation of how to capture the relationship between these two deeply similar phenomena in linguistic theory.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001406/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001406<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>clitic doubling, clitics, agreement, amharic, object shift, m-merger, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001406/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2011]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1317 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001406">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001406">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
