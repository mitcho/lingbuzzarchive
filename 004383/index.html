Guided by data from Amis (Formosan, Austronesian), I argue that case assignment may apply to a single DP more than once and case-stacking is overt realisation of multiple case assignment. In Amis, a DP surfaces with all the cases it has been assigned when it is a contrastive topic. Moreover, Amis provides strong evidence for treating case-stacking truly as stacking of multiple cases, instead of stacking a focus marker over a case marker.

In addition, I propose that case morphology and whether a DP can undergo certain type of movement are both mediated by 𝜙-agreement. Specifically, each successful 𝜙-agreement with a DP introduces to the DP a K(ase), a structural correlate of morphological case. This is based on the behavior of subjects of perfective clauses. I posit that in Amis, perfective subjects, as opposed to imperfective subjects, are 𝜙-defective. This is manifested in one fewer instance of case assignment and inability to undergo certain type of movement. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004383/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004383<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>MIT Dissertation</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>case, case-stacking, movement, raising, contrastive topic, amis, austronesian, syntax, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>666 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004383">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004383">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
