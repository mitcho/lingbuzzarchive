For example, in a math class with four girls (Alice, Beth, Carol, and Diane) the interpretation of the pronoun 'she' in the English sentence 'Every girl in math hopes that she will be an astronaut' varies according to which girl is picked out. For such a sentence to be evaluated as true it must be the case that each substitution of the pronoun for a constant yields a true proposition:  Alice hopes that Alice will be an astronaut, Beth hopes that Beth will be an astronaut, and so on.  Such sentences are often rendered by logical formulas such as [∀x, girl-in-math(x), x hopes that x will be an astronaut]. The study of BVA has figured prominently in modern studies of grammar, and has proven to be an important testing ground for formal theories of syntax and semantics. Here, we focus on the syntax of BVA.

After establishing that the necessary and sufficient conditions for BVA represent a convergence of semantic and syntactic properties (§1), we examine the distribution of bound variables in A-binding and A’-binding contexts (§2). We then turn to the question of the form of (A-bound and A’-bound) BVAs (§3), focusing on whether they can surface as reflexives, (overt or covert) pronouns, copy anaphors, unspecified binding expressions (UBEs), or indexicals. After considering whether the internal syntax of bound variables is uniform (§4), we attend to their semantic type (§5). We concude with a retrospective assessment of how analyses of BVA have developed over time, and speculate about future prospects (§6).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002280/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002280<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Blackwell Companion to Syntax</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pronoun, variable, quantificational binding, c-command, scope, a-bound variable, a’-bound variable, pro, pro, condition a, condition b, condition c, reflexive, unspecified binding expression, r-expression, copy anaphor, indexical, vp-ellipsis, sloppy identity, strict identity, wh-movement, wh-trace, resumptive pronoun, copy movement, wh-copy, e-pronoun, epithet, disguised definite description, d-pronoun, phi-pronoun, individual variable, individual constant, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2032 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002280">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002280">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
