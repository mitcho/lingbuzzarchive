Rizzi (1997) proposed a fine-grained analysis of the left periphery of the clause. Most notably, he proposed that the syntactic space pertaining to the complementizer should not be considered as a single projection, but should be better conceived of as a layer, i.e. as a set of hierarchically ordered projections. Rizzi’s proposal on the structure of the left periphery of the clause is the following:
(1) CFORCE TOP1* FOC TOP2* CFIN IP
In this framework, a focused phrase is argued to be moved, whereas topics, at least clitic left dislocation (henceforth, CLLD), are usually analyzed as base generated – see Cinque (1990). Under these assumptions it turns out, therefore, that the C-layer is a hybrid one, mixing movement, for the derivation concerning a contrastive focus, and base generation, for CLLD and HT.
The unmoved status of CLLD and HT is a very interesting anomaly in the theory of grammar, because the obvious question arising in this connection is how come they are possible at all, being neither arguments – the argument being the clitic – nor operators connected to a variable.
Here I argue that the unmoved status of HT and CLLD follows from their peculiar syntax, given that the heads projecting the phrases where they are hosted are prosody-oriented heads. Prosody-oriented heads are not associated to a lexical content – even if they probably have to be endowed with structure building features, specifying the category of their complement – but to a phonological one, i.e. are read off at the interface with phonology and assigned a particular prosodic value. The interaction of these phrases, generated inside prosody-oriented projections, with the rest of syntax is the object of this paper.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002543/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002543<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Bayer, Hinterholzl, Trotzke (eds), Discourse oriented syntax, John Benjamins</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>clitic left dislocation, hanging topic, left periphery, parentheticals, prosody syntax interface, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>822 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002543">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002543">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
