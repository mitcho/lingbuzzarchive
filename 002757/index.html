Concerning the observation that obstruent-initial and s-initial clusters diverge in their phonological behaviour, researchers who advocate a structural approach propose that this motivates different representations for these two cluster types, while researchers who advocate a perceptual approach propose that this difference can be explained solely by perceptual considerations. In this paper, I return to a structural approach to syllable well-formedness, but one which is informed by perceptual considerations. Concerning the type of structure that holds for word-initial sC, these clusters will be shown to mirror the phonotactic profile of ordinary coda+onset clusters (e.g. s+stop is always well-formed, while s+sonorant is not); because of this, I adopt the position of Government Phonology that sC clusters are coda+onset clusters and, critically, that this position holds for the left edge of words as well as medially. The paper then explores the predictions that stem from a coda+onset analysis of word-initial sC clusters for second language acquisition. Specifically, it is predicted that in the acquisition of a subset grammar, learners exposed only to the ill-formedness of s+stop should infer the ill-formedness of s+sonorant. This is experimentally supported, through an examination of naïve English-speaking learners of Brazilian Portuguese.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002757/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002757<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Proceedings of the 33rd West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics.
