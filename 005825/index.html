They do so by recombining or figuratively stretching familiar concepts and by creating new expressions or by rearranging or enriching already available elements. In general this kind of process is studied in hindsight, looking at neologisms that have emerged in the past. But linguistic theorizing is about explanation and explanation is tested by prediction, so this study probes into the predictability of this phenomenon using an experimental approach. Elaborating on ideas presented by Müller (1870), approvingly taken up by Darwin (1871) and specified among others by Croft (2000) and Aronoff (2017) the theoretical basis of the investigation views the dynamics of thought and language as special kind of evolutionary process. Given the hybrid nature of language as a quasi-natural social artifact, the creation of a novel concept and the spread of a new label or usage for it can be assumed to combine conscious reflection and more or less unconscious processes of adaptation both within and across individuals. The research question to be answered by this study was: What is the identity and relative weight of the factors that determine the conceptualization of a new phenomenon, the creation of different labels for it, its ranking by individuals and by a community and eventually the selection of the survivor? The results are surprising in two seemingly incompatible regards: One the one hand subjects produced a stunning pool of different labels and were thus far more creative than anticipated, one the other hand the derived properties of the most successful competitors were sufficient to demonstrate that approximately predicting the survivors is nevertheless possible.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005825/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005825<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Fiorentini, I., Goria, E., & Mauri, C.
