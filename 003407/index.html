Findlay</a><br/>November 2016</center>&nbsp;<p></p>The aim of this paper is to provide an adequate analysis in LFG of the
prepositional passive, e.g. 'That problem has been dealt with', 'My pen has been
written with'. This construction has been examined in LFG before by Bresnan
(1982), Lødrup (1991), and Alsina (2009), but empirical and theoretical
problems, some well-documented, some new, mean that such proposals cannot
be maintained. Instead, I offer an account couched in recent work on
the mapping between grammatical functions and arguments (Asudeh et al.,
2014; Findlay, 2014a) that treats the defining characteristic of the prepositional
passive not as purely syntactic, but rather as being located at the interface
between syntax and semantics.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003407/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003407<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the Joint 2016 Conference on Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar and Lexical Functional Grammar</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>prepositional passive, passive, pseudopassive, syntax-semantics interface, argument linking, lfg, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>297 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003407">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003407">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
