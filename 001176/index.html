This paper tackles individual level variability, building a minimalist type theory that allows us to capture this aspect of linguistic variation. The proposal builds on the idea that self-Merge can only be ruled out by stipulation, and removal of this stipulation allows unary branching structures into our system. I propose that these unary branching structures take the place of functional sequences, reserving binary Merge for specifiers (and hence recursion), and that they also (following Brody 2000) provide us with insertion loci for spellout. Within such a system, one is able to capture both parametric variation (as a property of which labelled functional sequences remain after acquisition) and individual level variability, as the underdetermined insertion of phonological material into these sequences. I draw out the way that the resulting theory interacts with issues of blocking, linguistic variability, and language change.
