Only when the smallest search domain is exhausted or otherwise inapplicable are wider search domains open to Merge. This in effect results in internal Merge being the first option, external Merge being the second, and sideward movement being the last. The results of this minimal search condition are that Merge as an explanation for displacement is made more explicit, ungrammatical phase- escape is ruled-out as a possibility (as opposed to ungrammatical, yet possible), sideward movement is effectively ruled-out as movement option, and the generalization the displacement result in a c-command configuration is enforced without need of explicit encoding. These results obtain due to a plausible implementation of the notion that some of human language is shaped by so-called third factor constraints like minimal search.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002422/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002422<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Coming out in Lingua</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>merge, movement, sideward movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1842 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002422">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002422">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
