The modality is often assumed to be purely metaphysical (e.g. Thomason 1984, Kaufmann, 2005). In this paper, we present novel data from Greek and Italian showing a systematic availability of purely epistemic readings with the future morphemes (FUT) alongside the predictive readings.  We propose a fully Kratzerian account (following closely Portner 2009), and argue for a common semantic core. FUT is nonveridical in both cases: the modal space is partitioned into p and non-p worlds, and FUT universally quantifies over the Best p worlds established by the ordering sources, which are reasonability and knowledge relevant to the sentence (called the 'future criterion'). With universal quantification over Best worlds an underlying bias is revealed towards those worlds; therefore in our analysis the future is both weak (nonveridical metaphysical and epistemic space) and strong, because  of the bias. Our analysis enriches the metaphysical modality of the future with epistemic components, captures the common core of the predictive and epistemic FUT, and provides simple tools for dealing both with  the novel facts of Greek and Italian, as well as apparent Moore paradoxical effects observed with future expressions and  MUST.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002326/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002326<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>future, prediction, nonveridicality, epistemic ordering source, reasonability, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1305 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002326">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002326">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
