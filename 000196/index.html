This workshop was made possible by a generous grant of the Borchard Foundation, whose goal was to foster scientific collaboration in linguistics between France and Southern California. The Foundation's goals were reached beyond anyone's expectations. The workshop initiated a long series of fruitful exchanges between UCLA, École Normale Supérieure, and Institut Jean-Nicod (CNRS), which took the form of numerous visits in both directions as well as the establishment of a formal exchange agreement.  It also paved the way for a Fall School in Linguistics (EALing, 'École d'Automne en Linguistique'), organized at École Normale Supérieure in September 2003, 2004 and 2005. Last but not least, the workshop initiated new collaborations with European specialists who have in the meantime taught in the newly created Département d'Études Cognitives at École Normale Supérieure.<br><br>



We are happy to make available for a broader audience the Proceedings of this workshop. We are particularly grateful to the Borchard Foundation for making this event possible. We also thank Nathan Klinedinst (UCLA) and Greg Kobele (UCLA), who were responsible for editing this volume.  Finally, we thank all the participants to this workshop for most stimulating intellectual exchanges.<br><br>
