This tradition has led to rather different terminological treatments of the two kinds of patterns, but from the perspective of a constructional view of morphology, there is no need to incorporate such differences into formal grammatical descriptions. For practical purposes, we need clear and simple definitions of entrenched terms of general linguistics, so the paper proposes semantically based (retro-) definitions of inflection, derivation and lexeme that cover the bulk of the existing usage. Finally, I briefly explain why we need sharp definitions of comparative concepts, and why prototype-based and fuzzy definitions of traditional terms are not helpful.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007006/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007006<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>"Linguistics (2024)" (open access)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>inflection, derivation, comparative concept, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007006/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1094 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007006">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007006">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
