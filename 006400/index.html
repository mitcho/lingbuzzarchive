QBCs are complex noun phrases such as ‘a jewelN1 of a villageN2’. In this language, QBCs appear in two ways: prepositionally (using the preposition də, ‘of’, and allowing definites, indefinites, and demonstratives) and non-prepositionally (only allowing definite nouns with definite articles and not proper names). We propose that in the latter type, N1 and N2 are related by a categorical match in their determiner layer, which we refer to as ‘match D’. N1, a property-denoting element, is embedded as a noun, which allows for two things: 1) the recursive DP strategy found in non-prepositional genitives, and 2) the extension of this mechanism to qualitative phrases, where N1 functions like an adjective. This leads to the impossibility of syntactic operations such as extraction, which we connect to the concept of phase. With non-denominal N1s, the article of N1 is treated as a head-agreeing adjectival linker, which forms a constituent with the modifier but agrees with the head. We argue that a phrase is interpreted as a qualitative binominal if N1 and N2 share the same number features and if the features of N1 do not allow it to be interpreted as the head/possessum of N2. We also discuss external agreement with either noun of the construction, and present data that support the relevance of the [+HUMAN] feature for agreement relations.
