Here, QBCs appear in two ways: prepositionally (with də, allowing definites, indefinites, and demonstratives), and non-prepositionally, (only allowing definite nouns with definite articles, and hence not proper names). We will suggest that in the latter type N1 and N2 are related by a categorial match in their determiner layer, ‘match D’. N1, a property-denoting element, is embedded as a noun, which allows 1) the recursive DP strategy found in non-prepositional genitives; 2) the generalization of this mechanism to qualitative phrases, where N1 has an adjective-like function. This derives the impossibility of syntactic operations such as extraction (which we connect to the notion of phase). With non-denominal N1s, N1’s article will be treated as head-agreeing adjectival linkers, which form a constituent with the modifier but agree with the head. We will suggest that a phrase is interpreted as a qualitative binominal if N1 and N2 share the same number features and if the features of N1 do not allow for it to be interpreted as the head/possessum of N2. A few words will be spent on external agreement with either noun of the construction, and we will see that the data confirm the relevance of [+HUMAN] features with regard to agreement relations.
