We present data from two such languages, Hindi and Tsez, which allow agreement with the rightmost conjunct. This contrasts with head-initial languages, such as Arabic, where close conjunct agreement is with the leftmost conjunct in clauses with VS order. This asymmetry raises a number of questions that we will discuss. First, is the typological difference between head-initial and head-final languages in the context of coordination due to a difference in the structure of coordination in these two groups? Second, to what extent is the syntactic configuration relevant to the computation of closest conjunct agreement? Third, what is the role of linear adjacency in closest conjunct agreement? These questions have wider implications for the analysis of agreement and the relation between syntax and the morphophonological component.  In this paper, we consider agreement in the context of coordination and explore the interaction between hierarchical relations, such as Agree, and linear adjacency/proximity in closest conjunct agreement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000874/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000874<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Variation Yearbook 9 (2010)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>conjunct agreement, agree, linear adjacency/proximity, hindi, tsez, coordination, head-final, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>299 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000874">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000874">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
