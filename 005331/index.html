The term affix is sometimes thought to be involve phonological “fusion” of some kind, but I propose that it is best defined as a bound non-root that occurs on roots of different classes. A bound form (or non-autonomous form) is generally defined as a form that does not occur on its own, i.e. its definition makes no reference to phonology. As a term for a form that shows phonological interactions with its host, I propose the new term welded form. I discuss the ways in which these terms may (or may not) help us justify the syntax-morphology subdivision, and the ways in which these terms may perhaps be the basis for justifying speculative classifications such as the well-known isolating, agglutinative and flective types.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005331/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005331<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>affix, bound form, welded form, morphology, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>107 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005331">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005331">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
