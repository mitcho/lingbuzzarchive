Everybody also agrees that chunk definition is done outside of the phonology: the existence of chunks is a prerequisite for phonological computation to run. The question that is addressed on the pages below is whether chunks are defined derivationally, i.e. by cyclic derivation which today is called phase theory, or representationally, i.e. by the constituents of the Prosodic Hierarchy.
The two ways of defining chunks are competing for about three decades, but the competition was systematically downplayed, and the theories that are affiliated to each option since the 80s, Lexical Phonology on the derivational and Prosodic Phonology on the representational  side, were officially declared to peacefully coexist. That they are in conflict, however, is obvious: Occam commands that there be only one way in which chunks are defined. While peaceful coexistence was practised until recently and both sides tried not to raise the issue (with two notable but short-lived exceptions, on which more below), the conflict has come to the fore as phase theory developed on the syntactic side.
Below the historical situation is recalled, and the recent debate is described: its origin are phase-based interface theories such as Distributed Morphology, which argue that phase theory is needed for independent (syntactic) reasons, while there is no syntactic or other independent motivation for prosodic constituency. Therefore the Prosodic Hierarchy is redundant and needs to be done away with (Pak 2008, Samuels 2009). A related question is whether translation (i.e. the conversion of morpho-syntactic into phonological vocabulary) and hence modularity (Indirect Reference) is abandoned together with the Prosodic Hierarchy, and hence whether we move back to Direct Syntax approaches of the 80s (where phonology may directly refer to morpho-syntactic categories). It is shown that there is no necessity or urge to go that way: the fate of the Prosodic Hierarchy is entirely independent of the question regarding the modular architecture of grammar. It is argued that the Prosodic Hierarchy needs to be abandoned, but yet for another reason: because it is a diacritic and hence anyway ruled out on modular grounds. But this does not mean that phonology can make direct reference to syntax: if grammar is modular, it cannot. 
The overall result regarding chunk definition, then, is that chunks are only delineated procedurally: the input to phonological computation are pieces of increasing size, and these pieces are defined by phase theory. There is no representational way of identifying phonologically relevant pieces. Finally, the consequences of this position are examined: since syntactically and phonologically relevant chunks only marginally coincide (the only good match is the CP), phase theory needs to be adapted to phonological needs.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001322/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001322<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>SLAM 4, a book series published at the Catholic Univesity of Lublin</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phase theory, prosodic hierarchy, interface, modularity, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001322/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2011]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1896 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001322">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001322">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
