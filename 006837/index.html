According to the grammatical approach, the SIs of a given sentence are logical entailments of particular parses of that sentence – specifically, parses with a silent exhaustivity operator, notated as Exh, a covert counterpart of ‘only’. According to a competing, pragmatic view, there is no need for anything like Exh in the grammar; rather, the dynamics of conversation suffice to derive SIs. The present squib contributes to a comparative evaluation of the two views. We will consider the pragmatic Exh-free approach in the context of two frameworks. The first is the neo-Gricean framework, in which an utterance leads to the negation of alternatives that are contextually more informative. The second is that of iterated rationality models (IRMs). According to this prominent and more recent approach, SIs arise from iterated steps of reasoning by discourse participants about the goals and means available to other discourse participants. We will use a paradigm inspired by one-shot reference games (Rosenberg & Cohen 1964, Frank & Goodman 2012) to argue that SIs track the entailments of overt ‘only’, thus providing further support to the Only-Implicature Generalization (Fox 2004, Fox & Hackl 2006). Our findings support the grammatical approach, which takes the Only-Implicature Generalization at face value, but are problematic both for the neo-Gricean approach and for IRMs that are able to derive SIs from non-exhaustified representations.
