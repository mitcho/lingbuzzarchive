Lubukusu has actual clauses, which entail that the utterer is committed not only to the truth of the proposition described by the clause, but that the event or state described by the proposition cannot be unrealized at the moment of utterance. We argue that the actual clause is tenseless (distributionally and semantically) and that it is subjunctive-like insofar as it introduces sets of “accessible” possible worlds in at least one of which the complement clause can be evaluated as true. Actuals depart from subjunctives, however, insofar as the actual world of the speaker must always be one of the possible worlds, and since the proposition must be true in that world to be well-formed, it is not hypothetical, but, in effect, anti-subjunctive. After we have established the fixity of actual clause meaning and shown the contrasting flexibility of interpretation for infinitives (verbs bearing a class 15 prefix), we show that the rigidity of the actual clause reveals an interesting interaction between the inventory of clause types in Lubukusu and the class of predicates that select clauses as complements.  <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004761/current.docx">docx</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004761<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantic composition, clausal complementation, actuality entailment, factive, bantu, semantic selection, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>531 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004761">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004761">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
