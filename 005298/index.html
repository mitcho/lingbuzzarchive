Of course, Darwin got it right! There is no other theory. But his theory was not designed to handle, as Stephen Jay Gould terms, ‘punctuated equilibrium’—a phenomenon which doesn’t at all abide by otherwise bottom-up, environmentally determined pressures of the sort Darwin spoke of. Well-accepted terms of the day such as ‘adaption’, ‘evolution’, and ‘biological pressure’, would soon become replaced by ‘exaptation’, ‘skyhook’ (a top-down processing as opposed to a bottom-up ‘crane’),  and  ‘non-biological’ accounts (of the sort Noam Chomsky would refer to as  ‘hopeful monster’).  But, in a more general footing, there may be some evolution left to language after all. It’s just the case that there is nothing left to the narrow scope of language as defined above—language as a narrow-defined instrument of ‘recursion’.   
Exaptation is a trait which can evolve for one trait but then become highjacked for another. Even this notion of exaptation would become challenged by ‘punctuated equilibrium’, (something bordering a hopeful monster). Claims of language/speech in such a capacity began to challenge the most common of notions related to how things get acquired, learned and processed. It would certainly defy the radical behaviorists’ hypotheses that all of learning takes place within a singular crucible—a common melting-pot intuition that all belong to the mechanical world of clocks, language just being another sort of clock (with gears and levers, not unlike the ‘brain-as-computer’ metaphor which would later be discredited).  
This lecture presents the idea that the generally accepted Darwinian adaptive-notion that ‘function defines form’ is not completely accurate, and, in most cases, is simply wrong—at least for language as defined in its narrow scope. Conversely, what we show is that for speech & language ‘form defines function’. We shall use this analogy as a simple pedagogical device in order to reveal some interesting phenomena found in language. Indeed, ‘speech is special’.1
