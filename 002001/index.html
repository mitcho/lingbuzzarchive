In the following example, the  proleptic  constituent  is  governed  by  a  preposition  and  semantically  related  to  a  position 
occupied by a coreferential pronoun: I believe of John that he likes Mary. While at first sight, one may  take  the  proleptic  constituent  to  be  an  argument  of  the  matrix  verb  with  the  pronoun establishing  an  anaphoric  dependency,  things  are  more  complex:  First,  the  construction  is 
possible with a very wide range of matrix verbs, casting doubt on the argumenthood of the object. Second, a coreferential element is obligatory (cf. *I believe of this crisis that the president should resign),  which  argues  against  a  mere  aboutness  relationship.  There  is  conflicting  evidence 
concerning the base position of the proleptic object. On the one hand, there is solid evidence from anaphor  binding  and  superiority  that  the  proleptic  object  occupies  an  A-position  in  the  matrix clause.  On  the  other  hand,  the  proleptic  object  reconstructs  into  the  complement  clause  for 
anaphor  and  variable  binding;  furthermore,  the  proleptic  object  turns  the  construction  into  a (weak) island for extraction. Both properties would follow if the proleptic object were to originate in the embedded clause, but an analysis involving movement from the complement clause fails for 
conceptual  (Improper  Movement,  Freezing)  and  empirical  (lack  of  reconstruction  for  Principle  C and scope) reasons. It is proposed that these paradoxical properties follow if the proleptic object is licensed by predication: The complement clause involves a base-generated operator which turns it into  an  open  sentence.  The  coreferential  pronoun  is  the  variable  bound  by  the  operator.  The proleptic  object,  then,  is  the  subject  of  the  predication.  The  relationship  between  the  proleptic 
object and the silent operator involves ellipsis, as does the relationship between the operator and the  coreferential  pronoun.  Ellipsis  derives  the  (selective)  reconstruction  effects,  predication explains the necessity of a coreferential element while the presence of the silent operator accounts 
for  the  opacity  of  the  construction.  Finally,  the  lack  of  scope  reconstruction  follows  from  the pronominal nature of the variable.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002001/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002001<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Everaert & van Riemsdijk (eds.)
