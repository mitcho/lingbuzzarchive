focusing on complex segments in onset position within Government Phonology.
First, based on a broad overview of the existing models of syllable structure, 
I formulate a set of static criteria for selecting between different structural analyses: what I term the Sonority Criterion, the Unique Combination Condition, the Phonotactic Condition, the Independent Existence Condition and the Homorganicity Condition. Second, the study of the behavior of complex events under reduplication in Gothic, Sanskrit and Klamath confirms that the complex events fall into two classes: the events that undergo full copy and those that undergo partial copy. In partial copy, the head alone is copied while the dependent is not. Accordingly, the independent variation of the event’s head targeted by a phonological rule reveals the structural status (complex onset/complex segment) of the unit.
An important link is demonstrated between the structure of onset events and
phonological rules in terms of accessibility. Thus, the Complex Onset Criterion requires the head of a complex onset to be accessible to phonological rules independently of the onset dependent. This leads to the Head Constraint for complex segments that limits access to their internal structure. Thus, complex onsets differ from complex segments in terms of Vertical Locality, which describes the structural depth at which rules may operate. This approach leads to a cross-linguistic analysis of phonetic events in Gothic, Sanskrit,
Klamath, Florentine Italian and Leon Spanish and provides evidence for branching in the onset. It also suggests the Segmental Integrity Hypothesis, which states that all rules accessing the internal structure of complex segments are phonetic, rather than phonological.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004130/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004130<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>onset, complex segments, vertical locality, segmental integrity, phonemic analysis, reduplication, lenition, gorgia, klamath</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>106 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004130">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004130">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
