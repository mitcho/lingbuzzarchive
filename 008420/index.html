In an array of constructions, a disyllabic verb may be “split” into two parts, and surface as a discontinuous string. We develop a formal account that combines (i) an affix-induced, morphological Syllable Subtraction rule on the higher copy, and (ii) subsequent Partial Copy Deletion (CD) on the lower copy. We argue that the apparent scattered pattern of deletion arises from the interplay of these two distinct operations. We propose the Chain-Faithfulness condition, which plays a critical role in regulating how CD applies. The idea is that CD must preserve the integrity of the input of the movement chain in its final output of linearization. Partial CD is forced as a last resort strategy to avoid violation of the Chain-Faithfulness condition. Our proposal has two implications on the precise nature of CD. First, Partial CD is not restricted to phrasal elements, but can also apply to heads, lending support to the idea that both head movement and phrasal movement are subject to the same linearization mechanism. Second, it suggests that discontinuous predicates are not derived by one “scattered/distributed” deletion; rather, it always involves two distinct operations, affecting different chain copies. The dual characterization of discontinuity explains why discontinuous predicates are not universally attested, and why they preserve a complementary character across languages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008420/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008420<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>copy deletion, partial deletion, discontinuous predicates, head chains, faithfulness, last resort, cantonese, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/008420/v2.pdf">v2 [September 2024]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/008420/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2024]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>476 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008420">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008420">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
