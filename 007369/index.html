This difference in the lexical semantics of English causatives and their Mandarin counterparts is supposed to explain why Mandarin, but not English, allows zero-change construals for perfective sentences headed by such verbs (_Yuehan burned his book, but he didn't get burned at all_). On this view, Mandarin simple verbs such as _shāo_ or _shā_ are ``implied fulfillment verbs'', i.e. verbs that implicate but do not entail the result obtained when the described action is successful, like English _wash_. The current paper argues against this view by showing on the basis of old and new event structure tests that Mandarin simple verbs cannot be collapsed into one class of implied fulfillment verbs: Mandarin has underived simple verbs with causative semantics, whose intransitive alternants are anticausatives, while  intransitive alternants of  Mandarin _wash_-verbs form what we call antiagentives. A key aspectual difference between the two types of intransitive alternants is that while antiagentives allow zero-change construals, anticausatives do not (e.g. in Mandarin, _The t-shirt has washed, but it isn't cleaner at all_ is felicitous, while _The book has burned, but it didn't get burned at all_ is not). We show that there is a perfect correspondence between the set of simple verbs that yield
(respectively do not yield) telic VPs and the set of transitive simple verbs that allow (respectively do not allow) intransitive uses in sentences with a
theme subject (Cheng 1989). This paper accounts for Cheng's generalization, and in the same time uncovers a striking similarity  between Mandarin antiagentive construals and German adjectival passives. While we show that accomplishments derived from simple verbs do exist in Mandarin, we also confirm the general view according to which simple verbs are more weakly telic than their resultative verbal compounds, since the latter yield neither atelic readings, nor zero-change construals.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007369/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007369<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>crosslinguistic lexical semantics, non-culminating accomplishments, telicity, causativity, perfective aspect, perfect, lexical aspect, mandarin, german, causative alternation, anticausative verbs, antiagentive verbs, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007369/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2023]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>444 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007369">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007369">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
