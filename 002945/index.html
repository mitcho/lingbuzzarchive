The work is co-authored and edited by Hans Broekhuis. The aim of this publication is to present a synthesis of the available knowledge of Dutch syntax. It is primarily concerned with language description and not with linguistic theory, providing support to all researchers of language and linguistics, including advanced students. The three volumes "Verbs and Verb Phrases" discuss the internal make-up and distribution of verb phrases and clauses. After a general introduction covering various non-syntactic issues including inflection and tense marking, Volume 1 provides an extensive discussion of argument structure and verb frame alternations (passivization, middle formation, dative alternation, etc.). Volume 2 is devoted to various types of verbal/clausal complements in complex clauses, and includes discussions of controle, verb clustering, etc. Volume 3 contains discussions of adverbial modification and the organization of the clause, and provides an in-depth description of Dutch word order (verb movement, various forms of wh-movement, scrambling, extraposition, left and right dislocation, etc.)<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002945/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002945<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Amsterdam University Press.
