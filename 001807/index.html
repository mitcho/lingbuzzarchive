It is standardly assumed that contrastive focus preposing targets the CP area in English (Rizzi, 1997). Emonds (1969, 2004, 2012) and Haegeman (2012) show that negative preposing, locative inversion, topic/focus fronting are all Root Transformations in English. Hence they can occur in root (or root-like) environments. Within the intervention-based analysis of Haegeman (2012) this constraint is explained by assuming the existence of an event operator in factive clauses (Aboh, 2005), which stops the discourse-oriented constituent from moving to the left periphery. If so, focus preposing is predicted to be incompatible with subordinate clauses which are complement of factive predicates. On the other hand, focus fronting is allowed in non-factive environments in English, given that this type of clause does not contain a factive operator.
We discuss the phenomenon of focus fronting and negative preposing in Spanish and claim that these operations undergo movement to the TP area in this type of language (cf. Jiménez-Fernández & Miyagawa 2012, for a similar analysis of topic preposing). Under this analysis, we should expect that under no circumstances will the factive operator intervene with focus in subordinate clauses. Hence, focus fronting will be totally compatible with referential CPs.
Based on the strategy of discourse-feature inheritance (Miyagawa 2010), the crosslinguistic distinction detected in focus fronting and negative preposing can be explained by proposing that the focus feature under C is lowered in Spanish, whereas it is retained in English. If this is around the right track, focused constituents move to the CP area in English, but to the TP domain in Spanish (see Haegeman & Ürögdi 2010 for the latter possibility in Hungarian). Evidence for positing that some types of focus undergo movement to spec-TP in Spanish comes from the syntax of bare quantifiers, Binding effects and Montalbetti’s effects.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001807/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001807<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>focus, referntial vs. non-referential cp, spec-tp, root transformation, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>925 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001807">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001807">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
