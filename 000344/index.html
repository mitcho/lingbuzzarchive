Since these constructions normally have an emphatic reading, these are called Emphatic Multiple Negative Expressions (EMNEs). In this paper I discuss the difference between so-called EMNEs and plain NC constructions. I demonstrate that EMNEs are fundamentally different from NC constructions, and that for that reason EMNEs should not be taken to indicate traces of NC in DN languages. Instead I argue that EMNEs are best analysed as lexical items that consist of two semantic objects, of which one is semantically negative. By applying partial reconstruction at LF both semantic objects can take scope from a different position in the tree. EMNEs are the result of the disappearance of NC in Dutch. After the loss of the preverbal negative marker en/ne, strings containing two n-words or an n-word and a negative marker niet could no longer act as a cue for NC and therefore had to be stored in the lexicon. The death of Dutch NC, so to speak, led to the birth of EMNEs. Finally the discussion of EMNEs and the fact that they could not be taken to be instances of NC sheds more light on the nature of NC. The fact that NC is subject to parametric variation firmly supports the view that NC should be analysed as a syntactic and not as semantic phenomenon.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000344/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000344<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Pre-final draft; final version will appear in The Linguistic Review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>negation, negative concord, lexical items, negative markers, dutch, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000344/v8.pdf">v8 [March 2009]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000344/v7.pdf">v7 [March 2009]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000344/v6.pdf">v6 [December 2007]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000344/v5.pdf">v5 [December 2007]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000344/v4.pdf">v4 [March 2007]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000344/v3.pdf">v3 [March 2007]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000344/v2.pdf">v2 [March 2007]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000344/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2006]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1341 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000344">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000344">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
