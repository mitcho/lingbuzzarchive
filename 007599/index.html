It should include an explicit iconic semantics, and a formal derivation of the pragmatic status of different iconic contributions. While QUDs (Questions Under Discussion) have a useful role to play, we argue that they do not replace the search for an explanatory analysis of the typology of iconic contributions. The behavior of gesture-bound demonstratives, pro-speech gestures and sign language classifier predicates should partly or entirely follow from their grammatical function and their iconic semantics, combined with general pragmatic algorithms. Co-speech gestures are better analyzed as triggering cosuppositions than supplements, but cosupposition theory needs further foundational work. Post-speech gestures (including post-speech vocal gestures, and thus some ideophones) are better analyzed as contributing supplements than cosuppositions, but there are various models that predict slightly different behaviors, depending on whether post-speech gestures are analogized to appositive relative clauses or to appositive gerunds. Throughout, there are diverse sources of apparently gradient at-issue behavior, but this gradience need not be specific to iconic contributions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007599/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007599<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear as a commentary in Theoretical Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>iconicity, gestures, ideophones, projective meanings, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>154 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007599">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007599">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
