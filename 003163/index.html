One recurring theme in these reviews is the data set offered in SoD; although the general opinion seems to be that the empirical coverage of SoD is unparalleled by syntactic descriptions normally found in reference grammars of the same sort, some reviewers maintain that the data set does not fully come up to their expectations. Especially the use of introspection data has met with objections and the resulting data set has been argued to be inferior to similar data sets extracted from corpora. I strongly disagree and argue that corpus data are of limited use and sometimes even quite harmful for grammars such as SoD, and in fact more generally for all synchronic research aiming at describing syntactic competence (that is, the principles determining the internal structure of phrases and sentences). The rejoinder is written such that it is not needed to be acquainted with the original reviews (which are partly written in Dutch).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003163/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003163<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Nederlandse Taalkunde/Dutch Linguistics, 21(3), 409-418</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, reference grammar, competence, performance, introspection research, corpus research, scrambling, long wh-movement, semi-passive, tense (future)</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>826 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003163">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003163">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
