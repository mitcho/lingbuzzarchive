Furthermore I present an explanation of NC that takes it to be an instance of syntactic agreement and I demonstrate how this analysis correctly accounts for the readings of sentences containing multiple negative elements, both in NC and in DN languages. Moreover, I show how different types of NC have to be accounted for and I argue that the syntactic agreement approach correctly predicts the unidirectional generalisation concerning NC and the syntactic status of negative markers.

Finally I compare this approach to other approaches of NC. Apart from the fact that those approaches do not predict this unidirectional generalisation, I also argue that these approaches (the Negative Quanitifier approach, the Negative Polarity Items approach, Herburgers analysis of n-words being lexically ambiguous and Watanabes analysis of NC as a side effect of focus agreement) all face problems that the syntactic agreement approach does not suffer from. 

On the basis of the data and considerations presented in the paper I conclude that NC is indeed an instance of syntactic agreement between a single negative operator that may be phonologically abstract and one or more negative elements that are morpho-syntactically, but not semantically marked for negation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000645/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000645<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Amsterdam</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>negation, negative concord, negative markers, double negation, agreement, formal features, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1649 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000645">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000645">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
