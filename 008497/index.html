For Murrinhpatha speakers, the abstract mergers underpinning genealogical or polysemic theories of kinship (Scheffler 1978; 1972; Scheffler and Lounsbury 1971) are not purely theoretical constructs. These are procedures that can be observed within social interaction. Knowing how to merge same-sex siblings, on the fly, appears to be a necessary requirement for cultural competence within Murrinhpatha speaking society. While acquisitional studies of kinterms have been able to identify developmental stages in kinterm cognition (e.g., Piaget 1928; K. Danziger 1957; Haviland and Clark 1974; Greenfield and Childs 1977), these psychological studies are mostly concerned with a select few types of relationships, and are usually limited to genealogically close kin. In this paper I examine the development of the entire system of kinship relations – genetically close kin as well as more distant classificatory relationships.
From psycholinguistic tasks targeting both the kinship lexicon and Murrinhpatha’s sibling-inflected grammar, we find that adult-like competence develops slowly into the late teens (Blythe et al. 2020). In some respects, the social learning required for mastery of universal kinship parallels the acquisition of literacy, in which life-long learning enables certain individuals to develop genuine expertise. Less is known about how children are socialised into systems of classificatory kinship. In data from the LAMP (Language Acquisition of Murrinhpatha) corpus, we find that small children receive explicit instruction on kinship matters from caregivers, older siblings and cousins. The mapping of kinterms onto the personal names of close relatives is instilled through pretend prompting routines in which toddlers are told what to say to whom. Caregivers use gesture and gaze to map genealogical relationships onto the participation frame. Overgeneralised kinterms are corrected when the mapping is inappropriate, yet the classificatory term mama (which includes one’s biological mother) is frequently overgeneralised, but not always inaccurately. This makes the process by which broader kinship categories emerge from focal referents something of an enigma.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008497/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008497<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Projecting voices: Studies in language and linguistics in honour of Jane Simpson</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>first language acquistion, kinship, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>182 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008497">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008497">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
