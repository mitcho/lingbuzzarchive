It argues that both particles are members of the typology of even-like operators in Hebrew, along the unmarked particle afilu, but that BIXLAL is special in that instead of standardly associating with overt focused material, it is constrained to associate with focused material which is covert (and hence prosodically null), and hence must operate over ‘covert-based’ alternatives. To illustrate this suggestion, the paper shows how a range of special readings found when BIXLAL appears in sentences with one dimensional and multi-dimensional adjectives in the positive form (paraphrased as very, -er than, in general, at all etc) can be derived by assuming that BIXLAL has the same semantics as even, but that it associates with the covert comparison class argument of POS in such sentences, leading to a higher standard with the prejacent of BIXLAL compared to the standard with its alternatives. A general conclusion of the paper, then, is that the (in)ability of scalar focus sensitive particles to associate with covert material and to operate over ‘covert-based’ alternatives should be added to the inventory of parameters along which such particles have been reported to vary both within and across languages. The paper ends by pointing out other potential scalar particles associating with covert material cross-linguistically,  and by examining the behavior of BIXLAL given theories of even-based NPIs and of the focus-prosody correlation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004277/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004277<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ven, focus alternatives, covert material, scalar prseupposition, gradable, comparison class, standards, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>50 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004277">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004277">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
