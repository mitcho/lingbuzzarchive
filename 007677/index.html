For example, “Avi is still reading Crime and Punishment" may sound infelicitous unless it has been established that Avi was reading it previously. However, “Avi misplaced her copy of Crime and Punishment" is an acceptable way to introduce the novel information that she owns a copy. We conduct an online acceptability study that assesses fourteen English triggers on whether or not their presuppositions can be used to convey novel information, which we refer to as a trigger's Contextual Felicity Constraint, or CFC following Tonhauser et al., (2013). We show that there is substantial trigger-by-trigger variation, that semantically-like triggers have similar CFCs, and that triggers fall (roughly) into three clusters—triggers that impose no CFCs (possessives, change-of-state predicates, factives), triggers that impose weak CFCs (non-focus iteratives and additives), and triggers that impose strong CFCs (focus-sensitive additives). We show that a trigger's CFC in our experiment is highly correlated (r > 0.9) with the proportion of times a trigger is used to convey novel information in a production corpus (Spenader, 2002). We then evaluate the results of our study against previous proposals for novelty effects and endorse a theory that treats presuppositions as fundamentally hybrid—some merely impose constraints on their local context, however others include an (additional) anaphoric element, which is less amenable to accommodation. We conclude by linking trigger anaphoricity to obligatoriness as articulated in Bade (2016) and argue that this property can explain a wide variety of trigger behavior.
