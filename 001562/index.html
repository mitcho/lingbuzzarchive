However, this infinitive-based classification proves itself inadequate in describing and accounting for the irregularities of the paradigm, for the alternations and syncretisms that occur. There have been, thus, numerous attempts throughout the history of Romanian linguistics to give other conjugational classifications based on the way the verb actually conjugates. 
In this work, I looked at both the traditional and modern analyses, and attempted to give accounts for the occurring alternations and seeming richness of the paradigm. Since Romanian verbs have different forms to express mood, tense, person, number, gender, and voice, to simplify the analysis, I limited the discussion by focusing on the conjugation of Romanian verbs in the indicative present.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001562/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001562<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>romanian, verb paradigm, alternations, surface forms, underlying representations, morphology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001562/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2012]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1361 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001562">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001562">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
