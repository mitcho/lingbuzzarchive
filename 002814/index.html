It also discusses what is needed to able to communicate in L2 with other people, and whether speech means a chain of words or sentences that are grammatically connected. In this study, we aim to find answers for these questions, to incorporate pragmatic competence and conversational strategies into practice, and to offer some suggestions beyond linguistic competence on some course books activities. The first activity for which we offer some possible implementations is a Role Play which consists of Opening statements, Monitoring Expressions, Negotiating meaning, Politeness and Closing expressions. Another activity which can be considered as awareness-raising is Sorting Closings and Cocktail Party which includes pragmatic conversations. Say that again?, as the last activity, is a Repairs and Practice activity  aiming to restate, clarify and reformulate what the speaker says.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002814/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002814<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002814">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002814</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Humanising Language Teaching</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pragmatic skills, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>51 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002814">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002814">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
