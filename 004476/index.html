It is often added that the reason for this must be diachronic. Despite previous contributions, however, (Haspelmath 1997: 87-101; Kurzon 2008), we still lack a quantitatively appropriate typological account of the expressions as well as an explanation of which diachronic developments give rise to these expressions. These are the main goals of the present article. Relying on a sample of 100 languages, it has been found that: (i) The structure instantiated in English by ago is far from universal and geographically unevenly distributed. (ii) These expressions are indeed predominantly postposed, which does not hold for their mirror images for the future. (iii) Evidence from etymology, patterns of polysemy and documented semantic extensions suggests that this asymmetry is the result of the different diachronic sources of past and future markers.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004476/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004476<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Typology</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ago, distance-past, cross-linguistic, diachrony, grammaticalization, word order, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>88 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004476">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004476">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
