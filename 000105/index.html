The paper is a detailed study of the English past tense in aphasia, and is couched in the context of the larger debate between connectionist and non-connectionist models of human linguistic competence. From the perspective of linguistic theory, the attention devoted to arguing against connectionist models is regrettable, however necessary it may be in the larger context of cognitive neuroscience. Research in connectionist frameworks in the past has revealed nothing new about the nature of the human language faculty, and the current research program is based more on vague and unsatisfying promissory notes than on results that have consequences for our understanding of language (McClelland and Seidenberg (2000)). The results of the Ullman et al. study indicate yet again that there are fundamental problems with the connectionist research program, about which we have nothing further to say<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000105/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000105<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>neurolinguistics, connectionism, tense, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>134 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000105">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000105">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
