It will be proposed that these three patterns are closely interrelated, and attributable to the presence of unvalued bundle of φ-features (π). Depending on which XP this head is merged with, different agreement patterns will emerge. Furthermore, these dialects will be shown to differ from the other macrogroup of northern Italian dialects purely in the locus of Merge of this extra functional head: It will also be shown that the almost perfect areal complementary distribution between languages with subject clitics and languages with person-driven auxiliary selection is not accidental, but is the result of the presence of an extra φ-probe doubling the features of the subject in different parts of the syntactic spine. A microtypology of v will be presented, unifying many phenomena that were previously considered unrelated, such as auxiliary selection, participial agreement, differential object marking and subject clitics.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002908/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002908<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agreement, differential object marking, abruzzese dialects, auxiliary selection, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1056 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002908">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002908">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
