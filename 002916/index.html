The linguistic literature offers different models for V2 word orders: Either the finite verb must move to a head in the CP field, or it must remain in the IP field. A third approach is a combination of the two, claiming that the verb moves to the left periphery only when the preceding XP is not a subject. The implications of the three models are that the CP-model and the mixed model would either exclude completely or strongly limit the possibilty of having embedded V2. The IP-model should allow free embedded V2. In order to test the two models for OE and OF, we have selected embedded that-clauses and analysed the word order with respect to the matrix verb. By using Hooper & Thompsonâ€™s five-way typology of predicate classes (Hooper & Thompson 1973), we show that embedded V2 is indeed possible in both OE and in OF, but that the availability of this structure is strongly restricted. There is however a clear difference between the two languages in that OE has very few occurrences of embedded V2, whereas OF seems to permit this construction more freely. We link this difference to the site of first Merge of complementizers in the two languages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002916/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002916<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Eric Mathieu and Rob Truswell (eds.), From micro-change to macro-change.
