It is proposed that relative clauses and complement clauses in Swahili some in several structural sizes, with supporting evidence for morphosyntax and the distribution of DPs. Given this proposal, a careful examination of cross-clausal movement forming relative clauses reveals a striking correlation: cross-clausal movement to form smaller relatives is only possible out of smaller complement
clauses. The connection between the size of relatives and the locality of movement is taken to a special case of the Williams Cycle, a general syntactic constraint connecting height of movement in the clause to its locality (Williams 2003, 2011, 2013). A novel implementation of the Williams Cycle in terms of the timing and organisation of syntactic structure building is proposed. It is shown that this specific implementation can be made to accommodate successive-cyclic
movement through the vP edge. The resulting implementation of the Williams Cycle allows us to resolve certain tensions between different areas of research in the locality of movement.
