ucts. In this article we investigate both the locus of ambiguity in the
architecture of Language and the origin of ambiguity in natural commu-
nication systems. We locate ambiguity at the externalization branch of
Language and we study the emergence of ambiguity in communication
through the concept of logical irreversibility and within the framework
of Shannon's information theory. This leads us to a precise and general
expression of the intuition behind Zipf's vocabulary balance in terms of a
symmetry equation between the complexities of the coding and the decod-
ing processes that imposes an unavoidable amount of logical uncertainty in
natural communication. Accordingly, the emergence of irreversible com-
putations is required if the complexities of the coding and the decoding
processes are balanced in a symmetric scenario, which means that the
emergence of ambiguous codes is a necessary condition for natural com-
munication to succeed.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001290/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001290<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ambiguity, architecture of language, logical (ir)reversibility, communicative efficiency, shannon's entropy., syntax, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001290/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2011]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>435 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001290">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001290">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
