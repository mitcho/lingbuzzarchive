It is shown that cross-clausal A-dependencies (CCAs) in several languages can apply across finite and non-finite clause boundaries, in particular across CPs, which poses a challenge to the traditional 'truncation' approach to CCAs according to which CCAs are restricted to reduced (CP-less) complements. Surveying the cross-linguistic properties of CCAs, it is observed that i. CCAs occur in contexts that do not allow clause reduction/restructuring; ii. configurations allowing clause reduction do not necessarily allow CCAs; iii. the embedded clauses can be true, non-deficient CPs; iv. regular structural case is available in these complements; v. movement to the matrix clause is not a necessary condition for CCAs; and vi. CCAs show several semantic and pragmatic restrictions which differ across languages. The direction proposed to bring all of the observed properties together is to maintain a universal improper A-after-Aâ€² constraint, but allow certain positions in certain CPs to qualify as A-positions from which further A-dependencies can be established.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004283/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004283<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>CLS Proceedings</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>case, agreement, (hyper) ecm, (hyper) raising, long-distance agreement, improper movement, clause size, restructuring, attitude complements, major subject, composite probes, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>232 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004283">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004283">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
