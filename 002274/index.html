While previous studies have found these languages to differ in their use of prosodic prominence
to convey focus structure (e.g., Lambrecht 1994; Cruttenden 1997, 2006; Ladd 2008), exactly
what underlies the difference remains an open question. We investigate two possibilities: The
differences might be due to phonological differences between English and French, that is,
differences in the means to convey a prominence shift; or alternatively there might be semantic
and pragmatic differences regarding what a prominence shifts conveys. We test these hypotheses
in a production study in which we vary the type of focus context (corrective focus, contrastive
focus, parallelism, cleft) to establish contextual distribution of prosodic prominence shifts; and at
the same time we vary the phonological and syntactic size of the non-contrastive material, in
order to test the hypothesis that the phonological conditions on prominence shifts differ. The
results show that French and English use prominence very similarly to encode focus in certain
contexts, such as corrective focus, irrespective of phonological factors. This similarity suggests
that both languages have the phonological means to encode prominence shifts. They differ,
however, with respect to the circumstances in which they use prosody, since French shows no
evidence of prominence shift under parallelism, while English treats parallelism similar to
corrective focus. Based on Roothâ€™s (1992) alternatives theory of focus, we propose that the
semantic/pragmatic differences between English and French are a result of different scope
possibilities of the focus operator involved in prosodic focus.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002274/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002274<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>focus, scope, prosody, prominence, intonation, phrasing, contrast, parallelism, semantics, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002274/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2415 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002274">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002274">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
