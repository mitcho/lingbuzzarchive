relation to genitival constructions. It proposes that the Apulian
non-prepositional genitives of San Marco in Lamis can be described
as regulated by a definiteness agreement mechanism manifesting
itself in the necessity of articled heads (excluding vocatives)
and genitival nouns, coupled with an adjacency requirement which
limits the realization of post-nominal modifiers of the head in a
post-genitival position, where they might only refer to the
genitive noun. This work thus proposes that such agreement for
definiteness is the same holding in Romanian non-al genitives
which result in the linker construction when agreement is
disrupted. In chapter 1 we thus introduce Kartvelian genitives by
Suffixaufnahme which notoriously represent a genitive-head noun
morphological agreement phenomenon. Plank (1995) also shows that
in a series of genitives, Suffixaufnahme shows up only on the last
one, demonstrating that when it comes to agreement in genitives,
local dynamics of sorts are often at stake (as it happens with
the Costruct State). In 2 we move to linkers; linkers have been
connected to agreement in Suffixaufnahme genitives at least since
Plank (1995) and later works such as Larson and Yamakido (2006),
Manzini et al (2016), and Manzini (2018), according to which
linkers can be assimilated to agreement. In fact, in synthetic
systems such as Romanian and Aromanian, Albanian and Arbëresh,
and Kurdish varieties, linkers agree for φ with either the head
or the genitive noun. Giurgea and Dobrovie-Sorin (2013: 126)
further show that in Romanian non-linker constructions possessives
agree for case with the head noun. In linker constructions,
agreement for case is not present: it’s the linker itself which
agrees with the head noun, this time of course for φ. Chapter 3
deals with genitival modification in Hebrew and a number of Arabic
varieties. It proposes that the pseudoprepositions found in Arabic
varieties are nouns in the Construct State. This was previously
proposed for Palestinian Arabic in Mohammad (1999), which also
shows that such elements agree for φ with the modified noun. 3.2
takes into account the Semitic preposition l-, dealing with the
question of whether this element can be characterized as
possessive and locative as it happens for Romance a. 4 analyzes
Apulian non-prepositional genitives and proposes as anticipated
that the necessity of articled nouns in the construction is to be
linked to an agreement relation taking place via D. Lastly, 5
