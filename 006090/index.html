However, the glyphs of Chinese characters do not directly express sounds, and the ideographic mechanism between the glyphs and their meanings is not transparent. We analysed the relationship between the glyphs and meanings of nine thousand Chinese characters and found that the combination of elements in the glyph constructs certain imagery, and this imagery is a psychological representation of the experience informing the concept of the character, so the meaning and glyph of the characters are ideographically connected. We use the many related meanings derived from the configuration to infer the imagery of the configuration, so that this imagery can explain the meanings of the characters. In the end, we found out the imagery and structure these nine thousand Chinese characters, summarized the five combination modes of Chinese characters, and extended these combination modes to multi-character words combining characters and characters. These results reveal the ideographic mechanism of the hierarchical combination of the internal structure of Chinese characters and their imagery, unearth the interpretable imagery and knowledge that directly represent the meaning of Chinese characters, and help propose a guiding theory for character word formation in the Chinese writing system.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006090/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006090<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>chinese character, imagery, ancient culture, morphology, cognition, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006090/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2021]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1026 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006090">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006090">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
