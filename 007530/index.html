We uncover a novel correlation between two cross-linguistic differences in Cross-clausal A-dependencies (CCA, e.g. long-distance agreement and hyperraising): only languages that do not have semantic restrictions on the DP involved in CCA (CCA.DP) allow additional A’-movement to CCA. We suggest that this correlation follows from the Composite Probe Hierarchy proposed by Lohninger et al. (2022), where composite probes may differ in how dependent their single parts (A' and A) are on each other. Specifically, in Dependent Probing languages like Japanese, Romanian, Tsez, and Turkish, [A’] and [A] features probe together for a single Goal, which derives the discourse-bound ([A’]) interpretation of the CCA.DP and the ban on additional A’-movement. On the other hand, in Independent Probing languages like Brazilian Portuguese, Cantonese, Mongolian, and Vietnamese, [A’] and [A] features probe independently and can trigger agreement/movement on their own, hence capturing the lack of semantic restrictions on CCA.DPs and the correlation with the availability of additional A’-movement. The findings implicate that features are systemically organized on probes in a parameterized way.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007530/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007530<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Proceedings of NELS-53</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>composite probe, a'/a-difference, (in)dependent probes, features, cross-clausal a-dependencies, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>269 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007530">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007530">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
