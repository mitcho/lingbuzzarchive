In earlier work, Kratzer (1978, 1981) demonstrates the explanatory power of these three dimensions. Assuming that the ambiguity of modal verbs is due to a difference in the modal bases they select, she is able to account for the different interpretations. Each modal verb can involve two types of modal bases: circumstantial modal bases that consist of the facts of the external world and epistemic modal bases that are made up of the speaker's knowledge. However, in her original proposal she does not become very explicit as to how these modal bases are selected. 

In contrast, this paper will account for the ambiguity of modal operators in terms of different types of event modification: whereas circumstantial modal operators turn out to be event modifiers, epistemic modal operators are modifiers that target a higher level, the proposition or even the speech act. Inspired by Hacquard (2006), one could assume epistemic modal operators modifiy some part of the speech event. Moreover, it will be shown that a fourth dimension of modality is needed in order to capture all the semantic subtleties of modal verbs.

Crucially, the speech event involves the epistemic agent, the attitude holder. In the case of epistemic operators, this epistemic agent serves as the source of modality. As it will be demonstrated, the nature of epistemic modal operators can be most efficiently described by means of a restriction on the modal source, which will be dubbed here ``Condition on Deictic Centers'' stating that the modified proposition is not part of the deictic center's knowledge. In order to evaluate an epistemic modal operator with respect to the Condition on Deictic Centers, the modal source has to be anchored. This process of identification underlies a strict hierarchical constraint: the modal source will always be identified with most local appropriate attitude holder: in case the modal predicate involves an argument specified as a attitude holder, this will result in a quotative interpretation such as `wollen' and `sollen' in German; in case there is super-ordinate clause that contains an appropriate attitude holder, the modal source will be anchored to this referent; in any other case the modal source will be linked to the speaker.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001385/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001385<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted to a volume on modality and aspect edited by Maria Arche</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>modal source, epistemic modality, event modification, modal bases, quantificational modals, quotative modality, reportative modality, evidentiality, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001385/v2.pdf">v2 [October 2011]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001385/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2011]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1055 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001385">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001385">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
