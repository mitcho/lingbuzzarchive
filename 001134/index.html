We have first shown that the internal morphological structure of personal pronouns is an irrelevant factor to license radical pro drop, contrary to N&S&#8223;s recent proposal that this property follows from the agglutinative morphology of the pronominal system. Following Huang&#8223;s (1984)/Bao&#8223;s (2001)/Tan&#8223;s (2003, 2007, 2009) analysis, we have proposed that CSE allows radical pro drop because of its topic-prominent configuration. This configuration allows a base-generated topic to be connected to a sentence-internal gap through the semantic rule of predication. This analysis, we have shown, can also be extended to many other topic-prominent families of languages including Altaic (Korean, Turkish), Austronesian (Indonesian, Javanese), Dravidian/Indo-Aryan (Telugu, Hindi), American Sign Language, Brazilian Portuguese, Finnish and Hungarian. Then, we have observed that the otherwise available pro drop option is blocked in CSE sentences with agreement and discussed its theoretical implications for the theory of radical pro drop. Assuming that topic-prominence and agreement system are mutually incongruent in a single language, we have hypothesized that the radical pro drop property in a language L is the byproduct of the interaction between the economy principle of pronunciation favoring the use of pro over overt pronouns and the lack of the agreement system in L.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001134/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001134<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to be submitted for second round of reviews</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>radical pro drop, agreement, pro-drop, zero topic, colloquial singapore english</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001134/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2010]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1638 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001134">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001134">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
