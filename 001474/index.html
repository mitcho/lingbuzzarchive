The relevant asymmetry, which was first noted as Greenberg’s (1963) ‘Universal 21’ and later extended as Emonds’ (1976) ‘Surface Recursion Restriction’ and Williams’ (1983) ‘Head-Final Filter’, bans anything from intervening between a prenominal modifier and the phrase which it modifies. The most famous examples typically involve prenominal adjectival phrases containing complements (e.g. *a [proud of his son] man), though the effect is actually more general. As others have noted previously, however, this effect, though pervasive, is apparently not universal, with some languages appearing to allow right-branching prenominal adjectival phrases to varying degrees (cf. Cinque 2010 for recent discussion). It is argued, nonetheless, that the ‘Head-Final Filter’ should fall within the remit of FOFC, as apparent violations plausibly involve considerable hidden structure (which is sometimes visible in the case of Bulgarian and Macedonian). It is further argued that Sheehan’s (2012, to appear, chapter x) account of FOFC can accommodate the HFF as long as certain independently motivated assumptions are made about adjectival modification.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001474/current.pdf?_s=IAcyOJAOdaAnlzbV">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001474<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001474">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001474</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Draft of a chapter to appear in Biberauer, Holmberg, Roberts & Sheehan (in progress) The Final-Over-Final Constraint: A Word-Order Universal and its Implications for Linguistic Theory.
