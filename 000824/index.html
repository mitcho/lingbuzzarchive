Nouns are argued to refer primarily to kind-level sorts, which define categories of entities in the speakers' conceptualization. This notion is characterized in semantic, ontological, and cognitive terms. Sorts, or nominal concepts, represent what is specifically nominal in lexical semantics. Not all nominalized properties are concepts; in particular, not transparent deverbal nominalizations. Concepts thus provide a substantive notion of nominality not coextensive with the morphosyntactic one. I present some evidence for the linguistic reality of this notion. In word formation and in phrases like plastic flower, the semantic value of a noun is its concept and not what it may be true of. The two often differ, as concepts are typically based on function and conventional expectations more than on objective properties. Concepts also seem to be needed in expressing semantic restrictions on affixation (ornamental, but *employmental). Finally, concepts are the value of nouns, not of any of their pieces; in particular, not of roots. This emerges clearly from the examination of different nouns (and verbs) sharing one root, and accords with the view that lexical categories have content, and roots are category-free.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000824/current.pdf?_s=2bUFD5l6TBzTM--J">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000824<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000824">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000824</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>lexical categories; lexical semantics; morphology; nouns; roots, morphology, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>509 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000824?_s=W-GGE0a7TE5plrBx&amp;_k=XDyS1D5Owh7_ZLy6&amp;2">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000824?_s=W-GGE0a7TE5plrBx&amp;_k=XDyS1D5Owh7_ZLy6&amp;3">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
