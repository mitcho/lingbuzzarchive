The instrument of this programme is interactionism (i.e. the interleaving of concatenation and interpretation) on the one hand, Phase Impenetrability (the PIC) on the other. The article shows that both have been invented in phonology, the former by Lexical Phonology in the early 80s, the latter by J. Kaye in the early 90s.

The interactionist character of Chomskyan phase theory affords a major break in generative interface theory. One consequence is that intermodular argumentation is now possible: the chunks that are designated by the spell-out mechanism for computation at PF must be the same on both sides. Also, the phonological and syntactic computation of these identical portions of the string must be restricted by the PIC in the same way. A particular syntactic analysis thus makes precise predictions on the phonological side, and vice-versa.

On these grounds, competing phonological analyses of affix class-based phenomena are compared. Since Lexical Phonology, the most popular solution are morpheme-specific phonologies, i.e. distinct computational systems that apply to strings according to their morphological composition (class 1 vs. class 2 affixes). An alternative that works with just one computational system has been proposed by Halle & Vergnaud (1987 et passim): the central tool is selective spell-out, i.e. the idea that only a subset of nodes (phase heads in syntactic terminology) is actually spelled out. Kaye (1992,1995) has supplemented selective spell-out with a "freezing" no look-back device that inhibits the modification of previously interpreted strings (this is Chomsky's PIC).

Since the PIC and morpheme-specific phonologies do the same labour in the analysis of affix class-based phenomena (they organize underapplication), no theory can afford to accommodate both: this would be redundant. If syntactic phase theory is on the right track, then, present and past solutions that rely on morpheme-specific phonologies do not qualify: the PIC must exist in phonology.

Finally, it is shown that Kaye's system also implements in phonology what is known as the phase edge in syntax (the sister of phase heads, not their maximal projection, is spelled out).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000798/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000798<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000798">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000798</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>The Sound Patterns of Syntax, edited by Nomi Shir & Lisa Rochman.
