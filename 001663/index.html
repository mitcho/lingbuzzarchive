The question this paper addresses is where the clause internal phase boundary lies in light of more complex structures in which aspectual projections intervene between TP and vP. I claim progressive aspect is unique amongst aspectual forms in English in that it is part of the clause-internal phase, whilst all higher aspectual forms are contained within the CP/TP phase. This claim accounts for many peculiar quirks of progressive aspect in English, namely in VP ellipsis, fronting phenomena, idioms and existential constructions. Cross-linguistically I argue there is variation as to where the phase boundary lies with respect to the aspectual projections.
On the theoretical front I argue this division in the aspectual hierarchy is best understood through a variable approach to phases in which the highest projection within a sub-numeration acts as the phase, irrespective of what that projection is. This denies vP of its exclusivity as the clause-internal phase, and allows the progressive layer to project the phase when present. This approach generally sits in line with the move towards a dynamic understanding of phases, as per Bobaljik & Wurmbrand (2005) and Bošković (2011, 2012).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001663/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001663<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phase theory; progressive aspect; ellipsis; fronting; existential constructions; idioms, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001663/v2.pdf">v2 [May 2013]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/001663/v1.pdf">v1 [November 2012]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1471 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001663">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001663">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
