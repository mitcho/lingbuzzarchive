Despite phonological similarity among this set of forms, these have traditionally been analyzed as separate morphemes. A closer view of their distribution and argument structure suggests an analysis in which these forms are allomorphs of one underlying, valency-increasing morpheme. A similar analysis of two nominalizing forms suggests that these are also allomorphs of one valency-decreasing morpheme. In each case (causatives and nominalizers), an analysis of surface realization is presented in terms of inner (or root-selecting) and outer domains. With the analysis of causatives and nominalizers in place, corpus evidence suggests that the inner causative allomorph and inner nominalizing allomorph do not co-occur (even though co-occurrence of the inner nominalizer and the outer causative is common). This data suggests a morpho-syntactic view of word formation, according to which morphological properties result from general properties of the morpho-syntax, such as the availability of only one root-selecting position for a given root.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008348/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008348<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>causatives, nominalization, distributed morphology, hawaiian, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>288 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008348">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008348">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
