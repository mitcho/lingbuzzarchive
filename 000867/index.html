The present proposal is a reinterpretation of the idea that the use of pe 'on' in Romanian is a means of expressing semantic gender, alongside of grammatical gender. While grammatical gender distinguishes between Masculine and Feminine forms, semantic gender distinguishes between non-neuter gender (personal gender) and neuter gender (non-personal gender). This hypothesis has a number of consequences.

a) It may conveniently explain the distribution of pe 'on', not only with nouns, but also with pronouns and quantifiers.

b) The distinction between semantic and grammatical gender allows one to understand why pe may be optional. Namely, while grammatical gender is necessarily marked on the noun's morphology (cf. Coene (1999)), and is thus an obligatory feature, semantic gender is an inherent descriptive feature of the noun, which is only sometimes marked formally by pe, when it is particularly significant, because the intended referent is "prominent". Hence, pe is optional even for person-denoting nouns.

c) Semantic gender is not unrelated to individualisation since only individualised referents are granted "person" status. 

d) The presence of pe with lexical DPs places constraints on their denotations. DPs, which are salient enough for their inherent "personal" gender to be marked, always have object-level readings. Of the specific denotation of DPs, they select the argumental denotations <e> (object) and <<et>t>(generalized quantifier). Crucially, they lack the property reading <et>, and are simply excluded from those contexts which require property readings. Likewise, pe DPs lack the kind interpretation which is related to the property reading.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000867/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000867<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Bucharest Working Papers in Linguistics,  II, 1, pp. 91-106.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>prepositional accusative, romanian, dp structure, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>866 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000867">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000867">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
