Chapter Two offers a unified analysis of Object Shift and Scrambling as parametrically determined variants of a single, primitive, head-complement ordering parameter  a version of Kaynes LCA operative at the syntax-PF interface. The verb-object order-preservation effect known as Holmbergs Generalization is immediately implied. The obligatory nature of Object Shift with weak pronouns is then shown to provide direct evidence that the phase boundaries defined by Chomskys Phase Impenetrability Condition (PIC) delimit a phonological as well as syntactic unit.

Chapters Three and Four explore the further technical and theoretical ramifications of the proposed linearization parameter for the derivational system of Chomskys Minimalist Inquiries and Derivation by Phase. The main findings, claims and proposals are as follows:

(1) The coexistence of order-preserving and order-permuting movement types in a single grammar lends further support to Chomskys phases (as linearization domains), and indicates the presence of a defective v phase-head selecting passive/unaccusative VPs.

(2) Those movement types that invert basic order (e.g. passivization, wh-movement) are also those that target a position outside the original phase, whereas shape-conserving movement (OS/Scrambling) is short distance, i.e. phase-internal. 

(3) The generalization in (2) reduces to the periodic forgetting of derivational information under the PIC, entailing that cyclic linearization proceeds in a manner diametrically opposed to the resetting algorithm of Fox & Pesetsky (2003 et seq.). 

(4) The weak/strong phase distinction is spurious and redundant.

(5) A unified, nonstipulative, lexical-array-based reformulation of the PIC is proposed. 

(6) Spec-v is the only possible merge-site for (there-type) expletives in the Probe-Goal-Agree system. This solves a number of technical, conceptual and empirical problems faced by standard (Merge-TP) approaches and allows a superior analysis of Transitive Expletive Constructions.

(7) Case features play a crucial, indispensable role at the syntax-PF interface, regulating the timing of Transfer/Spell-Out so that an active element is locally identified as nonfinal for PF/linearization purposes.

(8) The activeness hypothesis should be maintained in its strongest form.

(9) A novel, unified analysis of Person-Case and definiteness restrictions is proposed that derives and explains the previously poorly understood commonalities in behaviour between expletives and (Icelandic) quirky case. 

(10) Defective intervention (and the Match/Agree distinction) is eliminated, dissolving into a heterogeneous range of phenomena that reduce, variously, to PIC effects, Agree-(in)activeness, the timing of optional EPP-driven movement, and, in the case of Match-driven Move and multiple Agree, a parametrized approach to phi-completeness.

A much simpler, neater system emerges, one in which nonlexical macroparameters (such as the proposed head-directionality parameter) find a natural home as interface desymmetrization strategies that dispose of superfluous and illegible (symmetric) syntactic information.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000177/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000177<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000177">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000177</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ph.D. dissertation, University of Cambridge</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phases, pic; linearization, pf, shape/order-preservation; holmbergs generalization; object shift, scrambling; probe, goal, agree; expletives; case, activeness; defective intervention, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1737 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000177">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000177">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
