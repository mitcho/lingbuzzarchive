I first provide empirical evidence that Cameroon Pidgin English (CPE) has two types of resumptive pronouns (RPs): those that appear in a base-generation dependency (in topicalization) and those that terminate a movement dependency (in exhaustive focus). I show that movement RPs do not always fully match their nominal antecedents in features. Base-generation RPs, however, follow the regular pattern of pronouns in the language, regardless of the fact that the non-human RP in this context is underspecified for certain features. Interestingly, the invariant movement RP is syncretic with the non-human base-generation RP. I demonstrate that this RP is a weak pronoun that is only specified for accusative case, and that the syncretism in both movement and base-generation RPs is case-sensitive. I argue that despite the observed similarity in form, they are derived by diﬀerent mechanisms. I derive the case syncretism by partial deletion of structure, except K, for the movement RP, and
‘regular’ vocabulary-insertion rule on K after binding, for the base-generation RP.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007671/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007671<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>resumption, focus, topicalization, cameroon pidgin english, feature mismatches, syncretism, chain reduction, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>129 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007671">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007671">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
