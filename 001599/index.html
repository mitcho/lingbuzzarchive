This conclusion is notable in light of both Zulu's unusual-looking properties in the domain of nominal distribution and the long-standing assumption that Bantu languages lack both of these types of case (e.g. Harford Perez 1985).  My analysis of these remarkable and puzzling properties in Zulu is based on a close examination of some core grammatical phenomena – case licensing, agreement, the EPP – and affords us new insight on the interaction between these components.  Though the type of case system that I propose for Zulu is at its core similar to our current understanding of case, there are a number of differences between it and more familiar case systems. In particular, I demonstrate that the positions in which structural licensing occur in Zulu are not the familiar positions of structural licensing: none of the heads that function as structural licensers in a language like English – T, v, and P – are licensers in Zulu. The absence of licensing from these positions gives rise to a system in which case-licensing and phi-agreement have no syntactic overlap. Morphological case and phi-agreement, by contrast, do exhibit interactions that provide a new argument in favor of treating phi-agreement as a syntactic process. I also argue that Zulu has a novel type of morphological case: its ``augment'' vowel functions as a freely-applying case-licenser for nominals that lack structural case. The existence of such a morpheme is notable because this type of element has been explicitly ruled out by various theories (e.g. Schütze, 2001) on the grounds that it would render the Case Filter vacuous. Finally, I build on this system of case in Zulu to analyze constructions that involve a puzzling agreement pattern: complex NPs and raised subjects appear to allow optional agreement in positions where Zulu otherwise requires it.  In doing so, I demonstrate the inadequacy of a theory of ``reverse agree'' to capture the Zulu pattern and the primacy of a syntactic EPP to Zulu syntax.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001599/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001599<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>MIT</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, bantu, case, agreement, raising, epp, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2529 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001599">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001599">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
