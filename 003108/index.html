I propose that Mandarin has a T(ense) projection in its clause structure, which is headed by a phonologically null element ∅yǒu in a non-future episodic sentence. It is optionally pronounced as yǒu when the negation marker méi moves obligatorily out of its base position under Neg(ation) to attach to it in a non-future negative episodic sentence.

Evidence to support this proposal comes from the fact that ∅yǒu (/méiyǒu) demonstrates two major properties of a T(ense) head: the location of the temporal interpretation of a sentence and the divider of interpretation domains for quantifiers, as proposed in Diesing’s (1992) Mapping Hypothesis. Semantic analyses on the temporality of a non-future eventive episodic sentence in Mandarin show that its temporal interpretation is located on ∅yǒu. It is realized as yǒu phonologically, when the negation marker méi undergoes obligatory head movement from Neg to attach to it in a non-future negative episodic sentence. This constitutes the first piece of evidence for the TP proposal for Mandarin. The second piece of evidence comes from the observation that strong or presuppositional quantifiers, which include not only canonical ones such as měigèrén (‘everyone’) but also non-canonical ones such as universal free choice expressions (wúlùn) wh- dōu (‘no matter wh-’) and scalar quantifiers such as (lián)…dōu (‘even’), are interpreted above ∅yǒu(/méiyǒu), whereas weak or existential quantifiers such as yǒurén (‘someone’) or méiyǒurén (‘nobody’) and yǒu/méiyǒu-existential sentences are interpreted below ∅yǒu(/méiyǒu). This property of ∅yǒu(/méiyǒu) is consistent with the role played by T in Diesing’s (1992) Mapping Hypothesis, which says that presuppositional quantifiers are interpreted above T and existential quantifiers are interpreted below it.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003108/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003108<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cornell Dissertation Aug. 2016</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>tense, aspect, negation, existentials, free choice, even, chinese, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>237 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003108">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003108">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
