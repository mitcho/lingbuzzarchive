been postulated to account for the structure of phoneme inventories in the
world’s languages. In this paper, we test the explanatory power of this principle
by conducting a study of the co-occurrence of consonant segments in phonological
inventories, based on a sample of 2761 languages. We show that the featureeconomy
principle is able to account for many important patterns in the structure
of the world’s phonological inventories; however, there are particular classes of
sounds, such as what we term the ‘basic consonant inventory’ (the core cluster
of segments found in the majority of the world’s languages), as well as several
more peripheral clusters whose organisation follows different principles.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005636/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005636<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Phonology</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonology, typology, feature economy, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>333 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005636">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005636">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
