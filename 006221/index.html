I capture all of these phenomena as arising from compositional operations on rich lexical meanings. In the spirit of Del Pinal's Dual Content Semantics, these lexical meanings are divided into a category-membership determining and truth-conditionally relevant component (E-structure) and a bundle of traits associated with the lexical item (C-structure). This unified treatment solves a number of empirical issues related to these three phenomena.
(i) The treatment of generics given here explains a long-standing problem in the generic literature, namely why generic sentences can embed gender-specific traits ("ducks lay eggs"). I observe different felicity patterns concerning these sentences between bare plural generics and singular indefinite generics, and show that the theory given here, unlike alternative accounts, handles them well.
(ii) I give a semantic account of similarity verbs. This account derives naturally the seemingly problematic features of some uses of similarity, e.g. non-distributivity (someone who looks like a British judge needn't look neither like a Brit nor like a judge). I do so by observing that this behavior is rooted in genericity, and by extending the treatment of indefinite singular generics to similarity.
(iii) I give a semantic account of problematic adjectives, including privatives like "fake" or subsectives like "typical". I remark on structural problems with recursivity in Del Pinal's DCS. I argue that for the system to be fully recursive, the cluster of associated properties (C-structure) must be newly computed any time the truth-conditional content changes. Once we incorporate this principle, we can deliver specific and right predictions on the meaning of expressions like "fake fake agent", "fake typical gun" or "typical typical wolf".

I then discuss ways in which the compositional mechanisms given here can be justified by psychological theories of concepts. More specifically, I argue that psychological essentialism provides a useful platform to understand the difference between category membership and associated properties. Psychologically, diagnostic traits are ways to infer the presence of an unobservable quintessence of, e.g., leoninity. Compositionally, these diagnostic traits enter the truth conditions when the subject matter is not membership, but resemblance or typicality.
Then, I discuss in what ways psychologists have proposed to cash out the notion of diagnosticity, and what effects these proposals would have on the compositional operations I proposed.
Finally, I show how the present unified account fares better than alternative accounts of the single phenomena. Explanatorily, it is both more unifying and more easily connectable to psychological theories of conceptual representations so that there are non-underspecified predictions. Empirically, it naturally solves empirical puzzles faced by other accounts.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006221/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006221<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Qualifying Paper, Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>similarity, generics, privative adjectives, dual content semantics, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>250 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006221">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006221">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
