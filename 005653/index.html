crosslinguistically. In this respect, the behavior of the Modern Greek anaphor o eaftos mu is theoretically important as it has been reported to display a number of unusual distributional properties, thus leading to treatments by
Iatridou (1988) or Anagnostopoulou and Everaert (1999) different from that of standard anaphors represented by English himself and thus requiring a rethinking of the classic Condition A descriptive generalization and its theoretical
derivation. This paper revisits the distribution of this expression documenting that previous discussions are subject
to a confound as this expression is not always a reflexive, and it may have a logophoric usage. Controlling for the
non-anaphoric usage of o eaftos mu as well as for logophoricity and relying on new data surveys, we conclude that
when anaphoric, it is in fact a well behaved standard anaphor from the point of view of the standard Condition
A (akin to Chomsky 1986). These surveys support some aspects of the empirical picture presented in Anagnostopoulou and Everaert (1999) but not others. It does support an important conclusion of theirs, namely that this
expression is allowed as nominative subject, but in derived subject positions only. This in turn leads to a number
of new (theoretical) consequences and predictions: (a) the ability of anaphors to function as nominative subjects
can be reduced to differences in their internal structure (Greek o eaftos mu vs English himself), (b) an influential
theoretical innovation made in Anagnostopoulou and Everaert (1999) which takes the reflexivization mechanism to
be self incorporation as a general solution to why self induces reflexive readings cannot be maintained as a general
mechanism underlying anaphor binding in Greek.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005653/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005653<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted (comments welcome!)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>anaphora, greek, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005653/v2.pdf">v2 [February 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005653/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>872 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005653">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005653">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
