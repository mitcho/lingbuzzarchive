basis of morphosyntactic mismatches and reconstruction asymmetries between 
conjuncts. I will argue that ATB-moved constituents are present in each conjunct; while  those  in  the  first  conjunct  undergo  asymmetric  extraction,  those  in  the second conjunct are elided under identity with those in the first. Ellipsis in ATB-movement is licensed by means of an [E] atb -feature whose selectional restrictions correctly single out the elements that can undergo ATB-movement. Ellipsis applies derivationally and makes the elided constituents inaccessible for further syntactic operations. Asymmetric extraction is sanctioned by a representational definition of the Coordinate Structure Constraint: At LF, the asymmetrically extracted operator can bind both its own trace as well as the trace left behind by the operator in the second conjunct. Binding into the second conjunct is only possible  if  both  operators  bear  the  same  index;  this  in  turn  is  guaranteed  by  the 
 recoverability condition on ellipsis, which requires an identical antecedent. Since the operator can bind both variables, the single-identity reading characteristic of ATB is correctly derived. Finally, the reconstruction asymmetries follow from mismatches between pronouns/R-expressions and their counterparts in the ellipsis site which ellipsis is famous for, so-called vehicle change effects.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002969/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002969<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>The Linguistic Review 29(3), 397-438</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>atb-movement, asymmetric extraction, ellipsis, reconstruction, coordinate structure constraint, mismatches, resumption, vehicle change, derivation, syntax, e-feature</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>386 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002969">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002969">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
