I argue that a negative marker, which is usually considered an indivisible unit, can be decomposed into four subatomic features, which can each take scope in a different position in the clause. Under this approach negation is viewed as a complex predicate negator.
This dissertation consists of four parts. The first part introduces the topic and the empirical domain and provides the necessary theoretical background. In the second part the internal syntax of negation is investigated and the third part focusses on how the link between the internal syntax and the external syntax of negation can be established. The final part provides support for the account and extends the proposal.
The empirical trigger for the decomposition of the negative marker into subatomic features is the observation that there are syncretisms between markers expressing SN and markers expressing CN in some languages. From a nanosyntactic perspective syncretism patterns are meaningful. They point to hidden or underlying structure within a unit that is thought of as indivisible. The research hypothesis in this dissertation is therefore that there meaningful syncretism patterns within the domain of negative markers.
In order to be able to detect syncretisms it is necessary to know which types of negative markers there are. On the basis of four properties of negative markers, namely 1) their scope, 2) their ability to stack on other negative markers, 3) their semantic label and 4) their function, a classification of four types of negative marker is made. I distinguish negative polarity markers (PolNeg), focus markers (FocNeg), degree markers (DegNeg) and quantity markers (QNeg).
By means of this four-way classification I look at nine different languages and I detect syncretism patterns within the domain of negative markers. Starting from this ob- servation, the negative marker which is now considered the set of all negative markers, can be decomposed into its subatomic features: N1, N2, N3, N4. From a nanosyntactic perspective every feature corresponds to a syntactic head. This leads to the hierarchical organization of these four features into a binary negative nanospine. I furthermore argue that this negative nanospine is inserted as a complex constituent in the specifier of an abstract semantically negative head, more precisely SpecNegP.

On the basis of the negative nanospine and reconstruction effects I argue in the next part that NegP is base-generated on a lexical predicate. Negation is thus perceived of as a predicate negator rather than a propositional negator, which can have four negative features in its specifier. These negative markers determine the scope of the abstract negator, but are themselves not semantically negative. They are negative scope markers rather than negators.
Furthermore I explain how the features in the nanospine take scope in the positions in the clause. The four positions in the clause that I distinguish for negative scope are PolP, FocP, DegP and QP. I develop a valuation-driven feature system which allows interactions between the markers in the nanospine and the clausal scope projections. The account provides support for a feature system which allows uninterpretable but valued features to be deleted without checking. Checking or not checking leads to interpretative differences.

In a final part I discuss how intervention effects caused by the modal auxiliary must and quantificational adverbs provide support for the proposal developed in this dissertation. I extend the proposal to French negation and I show how the system can capture diachronic change.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001973/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001973<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001973">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001973</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Dissertation, Ghent University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>negation, nanosyntax, syncretisms, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>471 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001973">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001973">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
