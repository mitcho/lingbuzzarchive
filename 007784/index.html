Therefore, this brief summary of
the history of biolinguistics is centrally based on the narratives of some of its protagonists, such as Noam Chomsky, Massimo Piatelli-Palmarini, Lyle Jenkins or Tecumseh Fitch, among others. Thus, the only originality of this chapter will be the selection of topics considered and the emphasis on certain authors more than others.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007784/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007784<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Chapter under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>biolinguistics, chomsky, generative grammar, history of linguistics, syntax, phonology, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>357 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007784">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007784">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
