There two main kinds of participial complement in Lithuanian: the one involves the agreeing participle and requires its non-expressed subject to be referentially identical to the Nominative subject of the matrix clause, while the other, appearing elsewhere, is based on the non-agreeing participle and allows an overt subject mostly encoded as a noun phrase in the Accusative case. Both kinds of participial complement show full clausal structure, including tense and left periphery. The agreeing participial complements are shown to constitute a typologically not very common instance of an obligatory control construction. The non-agreeing participial complements fall into two subtypes. The first subtype is allowed with a limited set of verbs and can be best analysed as involving a participial clause with a null subject co-indexed to the base-generated direct object of the matrix verb. The other type of non-agreeing participial complement, as I argue, can be analysed neither as a Raising construction, since its subject does not in fact show the relevant features of a matrix direct object, nor as an instance of Exceptional Case Marking, since the case marking of the embedded subject cannot be naturally analysed as coming from the matrix clause. A mechanism of construction-internal case assignment is proposed to account for this data.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000846/current.pdf?_s=hbxgjgyzII-SBbID">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000846<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000846">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000846</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Accepted to Volker Gast and Holger Diessel (eds.), Clause Combining in Cross-Linguistic Perspective (Trends in Linguistics.
