A mathematical model, dubbed the Tolerance Principle, is derived from the Elsewhere Condition, and is tested on dozens of cross linguistic case studies.  An outline of the chapters are as follows.  Please contact the author to obtain a full pre-publication draft: the posted material is the introductory chapter plus the references.  <br>

<br>


Chapter 1: Border Wars <br>


The tension between rules and exceptions, and productivity, in language. Why this has remained an unresolved question and how it has poisoned the water for so long. <br><br>


Chapter 2: The Inevitability of Rules<br>


A review of statistical facts of language especially morphology and children’s acquisition of morphology with focus on productivity.  Contrary to popular beliefs, productivity should be understood as a categorical notion in language, judging from the now extensive cross-linguistic studies of language acquisition.  <br><br>


Chapter 3: The Tipping Point<br>


Using the Elsewhere Condition as a basic principle of language, as well as a performance/processing model, derive the mathematical principle of productivity, what I call the Tolerance Principle. Suppose a rule could apply to N items. To be productive, there cannot be more than \theta_N = N/\ln N exceptions that do not follow the rule. <br><br>


Chapter 4: Signal and Noise <br>

A very detailed study of the acquisition of English inflectional morphology and nominalization morphology, the treatment of metrical stress in English and its acquisition, and the important case of German noun plurals where a very small rule (‘add -s’) can be productive. The entire discussion is driven by the equation, using child-directed language data.<br><br>

Chapter 5: When Language Fails   <br>


The theory predicts complete lexicalization when the number of exceptions to a rule exceeds the threshold. I show that this leads to morphological gaps: without a productive rule, you only know the derived form if you hear it otherwise ineffability arises. Detailed numerical studies for gaps in Russian (Morris Halle's famous 1973 paper),  English “stride-strode-stridden” gap, Spanish verbal inflections in the third conjugation, and the masc. sg. genitive in Polish and its acquisition. The Tolerance Principle also directly bears on language variation and change, in that it provides/predicts the conditions under which language change is actuated. As a case study, the theory explains why—and when—the so-called dative sickness, and other instances of case substitution, took place in Icelandic in the 19th centuries.<br><br>

Chapter 6: The Logic of Evidence<br>

A completely new conceptualization of the indirect negative evidence business in language acquisition, especially in syntax. Instead of thinking about retreating from over-generalization, a derivative application of the Tolerance Principle ensures that the child is much more careful before generalizing. Shows how the learner may acquire that adjectives such as “asleep” do not allow attributive in NPs (“*the asleep cat”), and how to resolve Baker’s classic problem of dative construction acquisition (“*I donated the museum a painting”).  A critique of previous proposals, including Bayesian models of inference, is also included.<br><br>

Chapter 7: On Language Design <br>

Summary. How the current study impacts traditional problems in linguistics, and how it leads to a simplification of the theory of UG and language learning,  with a reduced role for domain-specific innate knowledge of language, leading to an arguably more plausible solution to the problem of language evolution.<br><table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002833/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002833<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>MIT Press (to appear)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>acquisition, processing, change, evolution, computational linguistics, corpus linguistics, productivity, morphology, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2340 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002833">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002833">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
