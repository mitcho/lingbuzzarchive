alterations. The properties and internal chronology of these changes are of great theoretical relevance to elucidate issues on the architecture of grammar and the place and form of parametric variation. In this paper we argue that standard non-derivational approaches to dative alternations, which assume that the agreement/agreementless alternation reflects a new situation where an 
emerging adpositional construction coexists with an independent applicative strategy, fail to account for important generalizations concerning the interaction of the changes. Instead, a derivational approach based on the incorporation of an adpositional head accounts naturally for the distribution of facts and conforms to the properties of dative variation crosslinguistically.
Following the same line, we also argue for a revision of the "High/Low Applicatives" distinction that approaches them to the situation of subjects, where elements of a very different origin occupy the same structural position.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002536/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002536<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Glossa 2(1), 78.
