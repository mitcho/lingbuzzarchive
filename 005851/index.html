However, Harley & Haugen (2007) argue that the distinction between true and pseudo denominals is not structural, but pragmatic, as one could tape with band-aids, not necessarily just tape. Our paper brings experimental evidence from two acceptability judgment tasks answered by 100 native speakers of English in favor of the pragmatic nature of the distinction between true and pseudo denominal verbs. Participants had to rate sentences where both 'true' and 'pseudo' denominals combined with similar/non-similar PPs ("He crowned her ??with a hat/with a rose garland"- true, "Tom paddled the canoe with a board/??with a spoon"-pseudo).The results show significant effects of the semantic similarity of the PPs to the denominal verbâ€™s incorporated object on the acceptability of sentences with denominals. Thus, instead of arguing that only some denominals are root-derived (Kiparsky 1997), we argue that all denominals are derived from nominal roots expressing n-like concepts, and that acceptability in combination with various PPs is merely a function of the similarity between the nominal root and the PP.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005851/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005851<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>NELS 50: Proceedings of the Fiftieth Annual Meeting of the North East Linguistic Society</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>denominals; roots; experimental morphology; nominal concepts; similarity, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>399 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005851">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005851">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
