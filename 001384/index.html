The clauses involved, the matrix and the ‘interrupting’ clause, are root clauses, which are syntactically opaque to each other. The content kernel itself, however, is mysterious in this regard: it appears to be accessible for the matrix as well as the interrupting clause, and the position of the interrupting clause in the matrix seems to depend on the category of the content kernel. 

I argue that the content kernel is in fact the remnant of sluicing, and A’-moves out of an ellipsis site in the interrupting clause. The apparent transparency of the content kernel then follows directly from reconstruction. This idea also accounts for a number of other well-attested properties of sluicing that resonate in amalgams: case matching, cross-linguistic variation related to preposition stranding and island-insensitivity. A detailed study of the interpretation of amalgams reveals that interrupting clauses can only express speaker-oriented content, which concerns precisely the missing matrix constituent. This is evidence for an analysis in terms of anchored parenthesis. Putting this together with the sluicing approach, the correspondence between the content kernel and its position in the matrix is ultimately derived via a general licensing condition for sluicing.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001384/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001384<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>LOT dissertation series: http://www.lotpublications.nl/index3.html</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sluicing, it-clefts, parenthesis, amalgamation, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>377 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001384">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001384">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
