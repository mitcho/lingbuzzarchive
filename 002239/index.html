The classic, non-derivational version of Optimality Theory hence does not predict the presence of phonological opacity, as it is surface-oriented. As one possible response to this problem, a thesis has been advanced to the effect that opacity may not exist as a productive synchronic process. Regardless of whether this strong statement is true to human languages or not, it seems clear that empirical status of phonological opacity needs to reexamined. In this theoretical context, this paper is intended to (i) offer a catalogue of cases of phonological opacity found in Japanese and (ii) provide information about how likely each case is as a productive pattern in the synchronic phonology of Japanese. This catalogue generally does not attempt to argue for a definitive answer for each case, but instead provides information that can be used to argue for one way or the other, so that each researcher can evaluate the likelihood of the reality of each opaque pattern.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002239/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002239<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ver 1.2: REPORTS of the Keio Institute of Cultural and Linguistic Studies 46: 145-174 (2015)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>japanese, opacity, phonological argumentation, rule ordering, (counter)feeding, (counter)bleeding, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002239/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3806 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002239">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002239">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
