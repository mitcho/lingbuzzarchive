I argue, on the basis of the literature (Kiss 1993), that in the multiple wh-question that has a pair-list answer reading the wh-phrase interpreted as specific always moves to the position higher than the wh-phrase interpreted as focus and takes a wide scope over the latter as a distributive universal quantifier, with the Superiority Effects not arising in the unmarked case. I also argue that in the multiple wh-question that has a single-answer reading wh-phrases move and function as a focus operator in pairs. I argue that the information-structural effects differ between the multiple wh-question that has a pair-list answer reading and that which has a single-answer reading, thus the way of deriving them in narrow syntax differs too, with the spelled-out positions of wh-phrases solely determined in the phonological component. I suggest that the spelled-out positions of wh-phrases are determined by the intonational properties of individual languages, from which the Superiority Effects is derived too, and that the Superiority Effects is not problematic any longer in the current phase framework (Chomsky 2008).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001445/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001445<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>multiple wh-question, the superiority effects, information structure, spell-out of copies, intonational properties of individual languages</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>305 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001445">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001445">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
