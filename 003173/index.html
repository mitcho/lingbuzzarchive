The puzzle is this. A sentence like (i) "You're allowed to draw at most 3 cards" has a so-called "authoritative reading", characterized by two kinds of inferences: an upper-bound (UB) inference, viz. that you're not allowed to draw more than 3 cards, and a free-choice (FC) inference, viz. that you're allowed to draw any number of cards in the range [0,3]. On standard assumptions about the meanings of "allow" and "at most 3", however, a surface-scope analysis predicts only a weak literal meaning, from which neither an UB nor a FC inference logically follows. What's more, "at least n" does not give rise to an analogous authoritative reading: (ii) "You're allowed to draw at least 3 cards" cannot be used to convey that you're allowed to draw 3 or more cards, with FC in the range [3, ...], and a lower bound that prohibits drawing 2 cards or fewer. The puzzle, then, has two parts: Why does (i) have an upper-bounded authoritative reading, and why does (ii) not have an analogous lower-bounded authoritative reading? We present new data that broaden the scope of the puzzle and that, we argue, challenge the decompositional, split-scope solution articulated in Penka 2014. We then offer a new (but partial), surface-scope solution based on a conservative amendment of the recursive exhaustification approach to FC disjunction as laid out in Fox 2007.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003173/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003173<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Slides from a talk presented at Sinn und Bedeutung 21, University of Edinburgh.<br><span style="color:red;"><b>NB: Full paper available at <a style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;" href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003307">lingbuzz/003307</a>.</b></span></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>modified numerals, free-choice inferences, exhaustivity, recursive exhaustification, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>383 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003173">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003173">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
