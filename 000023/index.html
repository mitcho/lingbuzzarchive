The aim of this study is to examine the acquisition of the Irish Initial Consonant Mutations in learners of Irish as a second language in order to determine whether this acquisition is governed by syntactic factors (relating to the triggering environments of the mutations) or by phonological factors pertaining to the mutated consonants. The results have demonstrated that both syntactic and phonological factors exert an influence over the acquisition and realisation of the Irish Initial Consonant Mutations. Also, verbal mutations were more frequently correctly mutated, and nominal mutations (triggered by nominal gender) were more frequently omitted or incorrectly mutated. This upholds the findings of literature in the area, which argues that the acquisition of grammatical gender distinction in L2 can prove difficult. Furthermore, there was no significant difference observed between the performance of children from Irish and English medium schools, respectively. This supports the view that an increased level of instruction in L2 is not reflected in an increased proficiency in L2.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000023/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000023<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>irish, phonology, consonant mutations, acquisition</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>233 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000023">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000023">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
