of possible determiners in natural languages: the so-called Conservativity
Constraint. We shall briefly illustrate the force of this constraint and informally sketch Keenan and Stavi (1986)'s view according to which the Conservativity Constraint derives from the boolean structure of natural lan
guage semantics. We shall proceed to discuss certain well-known linguistic
categories that have been argued to be interpreted by non-conservative
functions: only and the relative proportional determiners many and few.
We shall take the challenge posed by the existence of these categories in
order to propose an alternative to the Conservativity Constraint. This
alternative will be dubbed the Witness Set Constraint, which is inspired
in Barwise and Cooper (1981)'s considerations on the semantic process-
ing of generalized quantifiers. We shall defend that the proposed con-
straint does not suffer from the empirical shortcomings that have been
attributed to the Conservativity Constraint, and indeed, we shall argue
in detail that it correctly predicts (a) the existence of conservative determiners, (b) the non-existence of certain non-conservative determiners,
such as inner negations, cardinal comparison determiners and the converses of non-trivial proportional determiners, and most importantly, (c)
the existence of the non-conservative functions denoted by only and the
relative proportional determiners many and few. This line of reasoning
suggests that the class of functions from properties to sets of properties
denoted in natural languages typically by determiners is constrained by a
principle that simplies the semantic processing of generalized quantifiers.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002947/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002947<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Semantics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>generalized quantifiers; conservativity constraint; semantic processing, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002947/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>932 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002947">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002947">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
