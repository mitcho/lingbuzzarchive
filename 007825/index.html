Kuno 1973), in which the same Case marker can be attached to multiple nominals. It is shown that no matter in which order nominals appear, the Nominative Case marker -ga and the topic marker -wa can be interchangeably used for all nominals located in higher positions; they are topics, though they can be marked by -ga in the same way as the lowest nominal. It is also shown that the interpretation of the nominal located in the lowest position differs depending on whether it is marked by -ga or by -wa: the lowest nominal is interpreted as non-contrastive when marked by -ga, but interpreted as contrastive when marked by -wa. Thus, only the lowest nominal occupies a syntactically specified position where its interpretation is determined and acts as the subject of a sentence. We argue that both in Japanese and in languages such as English, only the lowest nominal occupies the structurally designated position, [Spec,TP] (cf. Rizzi 2016), acts as the subject of a sentence, and enters a syntactic relation with the functional head, T, whereas all other phrases are adjuncts, suggesting that the language faculty may not allow an individual language to produce a syntactic structure so different from other languages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007825/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007825<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in the Proceedings of WECOL 2023</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>japanese multiple case-marking construction, topic, subject, structurally designated position, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>270 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007825">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007825">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
