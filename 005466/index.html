Barner et al. claim that young children accept some in situations which could be more appropriately described by all (e.g., they say yes to the question Are (only) some of the animals sleeping? when all three of the animals are sleeping) because they are still not aware of the fact that all is a member of the same scale that includes some. This paper argues that the source of children’s difficulties with interpreting some and its Hungarian equivalent néhány is that some/néhány is ambiguous. It has a non-partitive interpretation, corresponding to ʻa few’, which forms a scale with non-partitive many, and a partitive reading, corresponding to ʻa subset of’, which forms a scale with all. The two variants of néhány/some have different distributions; they are selected by different predicates, and in Hungarian, they occur in different structural positions. For adults, the structural position, the prosody, the internal structure of the some phrase, and/or the selectional properties of the predicate determine the interpretation of some in most cases. We hypothesized that young children are not sensitive to the partitivity feature of some phrases arising in different contexts; they first acquire the non-partitive reading, which they overgeneralize for a while. The paper gives account of two experiments testing and confirming this hypothesis. Experiment 1, a forced choice sentence-picture matching task, showed that the primary, default reading of some NPs for six-year old Hungarian children is the ‘a few’ interpretation. Experiment 2, a truth value judgement task, demonstrated that children also accept the ‘not all’ interpretation of some, and the acceptance rates of the ‘a few’ and the ‘not all’ readings are similar irrespective of the partitivity feature of the some NP in the given context<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005466/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005466<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Formal Approaches to Number in Slavic and Beyond, ed. by Marcin Wągiel, Berlin: Language Science Press.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>scalar implicature, some, counting quantifier, partitive, hungarian, language acquisition, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>304 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005466">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005466">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
