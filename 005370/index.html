It turns out that switch reference languages vary significantly in this regard. For instance, the Macro-Je language Kisedje (Nonato 2014) requires SS-marking only when the referent of the main clause subject is a subset of the dependent clause subject. But Seri (Moser 1976) makes use of DS-marking in any configuration of overlap.

We present a survey of switch reference languages for which there is data about referential overlap. We identify two crosslinguistic asymmetries in how switch reference systems deal with these configurations. 1) The subset asymmetry (Wiesemann 1982:55, Stirling 1993:35): Some languages permit SS only when the main clause subject is a subset of the dependent clause subject. But no language permits SS only when the main clause is a superset of the dependent subject. 2) The person asymmetry (Comrie 1983, Roberts 2017): Some languages permit SS in instances overlap only when the two nominals match in person. No SR system is sensitive to matching in number/gender only.

We argue that these two asymmetries provide evidence for a syntactic approach to switch reference, sensitive to syntactic features as well as directionality, as in an Agree-based approach to switch reference (e.g., Nonato 2018, Arregi and Hanink 2019, Clem 2019, Baker and Souza 2020). In particular, we propose that an Agree account can derive the subset asymmetry from the idea that the subject of the dependent clause is accessed first, based on a preference for downward Agree. In addition, we show how Arregi and Hanink’s (2019) feature-conflict account of switch reference can be extended to derive person-matching patterns, on the assumption that the probe responsible for switch reference may also probe for additional features (Clem 2019).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005370/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005370<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>NELS 50 Proceedings</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>switch reference, multiple agree, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>120 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005370">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005370">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
