With the above in mind, the ideal perhaps scenario, in terms of transparency, would be that the mapping between form and meaning would be one to one (1:1); in other words, there is as much form as there is meaning. This would further imply that the mapping between form and meaning is symmetric. The present thesis studies some aspects of the form and meaning of two kinds of wh-constructions in Modern Greek, i.e., questions and sluicing, and shows that the relevant mapping may not necessarily be 1:1. With respect to questions, it is argued that the same form may correspond to more than one meaning. As regards sluicing, it is proposed that there is less form than meaning. On the face of the previous, the argument will be as follows. Syntax generates form, and restricts part of meaning, while additional aspects of meaning are facilitated by PF (regarding wh-questions) and LF (concerning sluicing). Finally, since PF contributes to meaning, LF `sees' PF, and vice versa.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001578/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001578<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Patras</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>wh-constructions, sluicing, ellipsis, echo-questions, non-exhaustivity, division of labour, phonological form, logical form, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>653 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001578">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001578">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
