This article shows that such a move is unwarranted: NPIs are indeed anti-licensed by presuppositions. But it also provides evidence that certain presuppositions are not incorporated into the meaning that is relevant for NPI licensing, and therefore fail to be disruptive. In light of these facts, the article offers an original typology of presuppositions based on their interaction with NPIs.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001194/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001194<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ms., UCLA/ENS-DEC</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>presupposition, npi, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>169 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001194">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001194">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
