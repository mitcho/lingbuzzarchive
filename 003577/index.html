This paper begins an argument, to be developed elsewhere, that this current approach is more than “taken to extremes”; rather it is fundamentally misguided. All functional modifiers truly independent of a lexical category are types of quantifying/ counting, written Q. 
In particular, a lexical phrase NP (in plural-marking languages) is extended by a head for numerals QN to NPQ (not by D, which is a SPEC). Since As and Ps can’t be counted, their QA and QP can indicate only degree, supplemented by optional measure phrase NPs in their SPEC. The QV extension of VP is familiarly known as I or T, but formally its role is I claim to count, through agreement with “subject” NPs in its SPEC, the simultaneous events predicated of this subject. Modals, tense, etc. are lexical extensions of QV that specify how to compute “simultaneous.”
