The present study explores the functional categories in Kovai Sign Language (KoSL) which emerged from a group of home signers in a school named “Infant Jesus School for deaf and dumb” situated at Kovai, also known as Coimbatore in the state of Tamil Nadu in southern India. The study attempts to establish the current language situation in the Kovai deaf community by examining the functional categories in the individual signing of our subjects and to determine the stages of development of grammatical structures in different generation of signers with respect to the age of entry into the signing community and the period of exposure to sign language.
A field work was conducted on 11 deaf children from the school mentioned above. The subjects’s age ranged from 10 to 17 and they hail from hearing family backgrounds. We delimited our group such that our subjects included early entrants who joined the school before 10 years of age and late entrants who joined after 10 years of age and they all had at least one or two years of exposure to KoSL. Our subjects were divided into four groups A, B, C and D based on the age of entry in to the signing community and the period of exposure to KoSL. In group A, we have the earliest entrants who have the maximum years of exposure to KoSL followed by groups B, C and D. In group D we have the oldest entrants who have minimum years of exposure to KoSL compared to other groups. This factor will allow us to deduce the status of this language in learners who have had early and prolonged exposure to it, as against those who are exposed to it near the end of their childhood and for a shorter period.  
We could complete the study in one day since the institution allowed the researcher to keep the subjects for an entire day. It was a cross sectional study and the aim was to collect free narratives from the subjects. As we found in our pilot study that the ‘structured elicitation’ technique yielding imitation of the given English sentence structure, and also the video clips used in Nicaraguan studies by Senghas (1995) faced problems when there was a power failure, and moreover we felt that video clips in motion might abort subjects’ interpretation of the scene as they move for every fraction of second, we opted for ‘picture narration method’ using a story excerpt from a Tamil version of ‘Amar Chitra Katha’ picture books for children. Also we felt that pictures would help them observe the details better than video clips. This method of data elicitation yielded free narratives from the subjects. 
Before the main study, we also conducted two pilot studies. Pilot one was conducted on adult signers from Hyderabad who use Indian Sign Language (ISL) to investigate the nature of functional categories in ISL and to identify their form. Pilot two was conducted on hearing children who use spoken language to get an insight into the language abilities of hearing children who are in the same age group as our deaf subjects as well as to see the outcome of the picture book narration method.
From our data on KoSL, we found the presence of functional categories such as pronominals and phi- features, tense and aspect, interrogatives, negation and relative clause constructions. pronominals and phi-features are manifested in manual signs, yes-no questions and relative clause constructions in non-manual markers and wh-questions, negation and tense and aspect are manifested in the combination of both manual signs and non-manual markers.
In the use of functional categories by our subjects who are grouped into early entrants and late entrants, we found the early entrants employing Pronominals and the tense and aspect at a higher rate compared to the late entrants. But for interrogatives, negation and relative clause construction, we find both early and late entrants performing at the same level. This is contrary to our assumption based on the Nicaraguan signing community that the late learner signers would lag behind in employing the functional categories in general when compared to the early entrants.
However, the division we find within the functional categories led us to go for further analysis which showed that the categories interrogatives, negation and relative clause construction that are effectively employed by our late entrants come under the clausal type or C- system and the categories pronominals and tense and aspect in which they lag behind come under determiner or D-system and inflectional or I-system respectively. In a syntactic tree, we find the C-system categories appear on top followed by the D and I system categories. Hence we see the pattern of acquisition proceeds from top to bottom (in the syntactic tree) with the late entrants. Though this result contradicts the ‘Truncation hypothesis’ proposed by Rizzi that children acquire sentence structures bottom up in the syntactic tree during the maturation period (cited in Murasugi 2015), we claim that our subjects being older, truncation does not hold in their case.
