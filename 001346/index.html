It presents evidence indicating that case marked object DPs escape the scope of quantifiers in Turkish and consequently, challenging former accounts on the issue (Diesing 1992, Stowell & Beghelli 1994, 1997).   In section (1&2), facts about Turkish definites and specifics are given. In (3) data relevant to the topic and the problems the data pose for Diesing (1992) and Stowell & Beghelli (1997) are presented. In section (4), generalizations on the data and alternative analyses are discussed. The conclusions reached are these: (i) the so called “weak determiner” bir is in fact a numeral quantifier and should be classified as G(roup)denoting QPs in Turkish; (ii) The universal quantifier bütün/all does not have a distributive force and needs to be distinguished from the universal quantifier every/her which has a distributive force; (iii) Stowell & Beghelli’s (1997) claim that QPs move to projections of their own to take scope may be accomodated to account for the subject QP and object DP constructions but constructions where both the subject and the object are QPs contradict their claim; (iv)quantifiers take scope at their syntactic positions in Turkish; (v) any overt case morpheme, be it structural or inherent, has the semantic property of allowing the noun to escape the scope of higher QPs.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001346/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001346<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of Linguistics and Literature. 2007</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>specificity, generative syntax, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>318 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001346">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001346">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
