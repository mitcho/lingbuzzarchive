We summarize key achievements of semantics/pragmatics, pertaining to constraints on possible meanings, the role of variables, and the typology of linguistic inferences. We then show that semantics can help illuminate diverse non-standard objects, starting with primate calls, by: stating precise hypotheses about their lexical semantics; showing that no non-trivial rules of call composition are needed; and suggesting that rules of competition among calls might play an important pragmatic role. Turning to human language, new developments make it possible to ask how iconicity interacts with logical semantics in spoken language, in sign language and in gestures. Sign language plays a prominent role, for two reasons: it has the same type of logical resources as speech, but sometimes provides overt evidence for them (e.g. variables); and it also makes greater use of iconic enrichments. This motivates a systematic comparison between sign-with-iconicity and speech-with-gestures. Semantic results arguably differ across the two cases because iconic modulations in sign and gestural enrichments in speech are distributed differently within the inferential typology. The comparison also helps uncover a proto-grammar of gestures. Going beyond language, semantics has recently been extended to visual narratives and even to music, using a mix of new methods and standard tools (e.g. variables). Finally, semantics is increasingly used to illuminate constraints on logical and non-logical concepts in the 'language of thought', and to propose new accounts of reasoning.  <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005242/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005242<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>formal semantics, super semantics, primate semantics, sign language semantics, gesture semantics, picture semantics, visual narratives, music semantics, iconicity, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005242/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>319 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005242">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005242">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
