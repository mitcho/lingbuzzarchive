The claim that language is perfect in this sense seems to be at odds with several appearances of imperfections that one finds in grammar. In this paper I address three such issues: (i) parametric variation; (ii) (c)overt functional structure; and (iii) formal features. These phenomena have been formed a big puzzle in the study of generative grammar. 



In my paper I argue that all these three imperfections can be explains if it is assumed that language is not a perfect solution to different interface conditions, but a maximally optimal solution. Given the fact that some interface conditions may be in conflict, it follows immediately that there is no single optimal solution, leading to the existence of parametric variation. 



I discuss that the C-I and the SM interfaces have different preferences for the expression of semantic operators. I demonstrate that the SM-biased marking strategies, preferring spell-out of multiple markers onto one syntactic node (i.e. on one lexical item), require dislocation effects in order to prevent the derivation from crashing at LF. Moreover I demonstrate that the dislocation needs formal features and that formal features arise as a result of doubling effects during L1 acquisition. Functional structure, argued o be flexible in nature, follows from the fact that projection must be restricted to formal features.



I conclude that all three imperfections in natural language immediately follow as a result of mismatching interface conditions. Consequently, parameters, formal features and functional projections, are not considered to be part of UG, but to arise during l1 acquisition.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000298/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000298<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Tuebingen</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>functional structure, formal features, parametric variation, dislocation, minimalism, interfaces, negation, modality, redundancy, ug, innateness, optimality, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000298/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2006]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>964 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000298">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000298">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
