languages that have morphologically overt case-marking on objects only display this marking on a subset of objects, namely those that are high in definiteness or animacy. In this squib, we set out to accomplish two things: (i) We introduce new findings related to DOM with conjoined direct objects, revealing that many DOM languages allow asymmetric marking in coordinations when conjuncts are mismatched in terms of animacy/definiteness. In the sample we tested, 9 out of 11 languages from 5 different language families allow for asymmetric marking with the two conjuncts differing in case. (ii) We show that these findings deal a fatal blow to many popular (broadly) Minimalist accounts of DOM, namely, those that derive DOM via movement. Since coordination structures are robust islands, it can be shown that, at least in these 9 languages, movement cannot be a necessary condition for DOM. We discuss two possible lines of argumentation in order to maintain a movement-based analysis and we show that both of them should be refuted. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003300/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003300<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>dom, differential object marking, coordination, movement, case marking, case assignment, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>815 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003300">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003300">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
