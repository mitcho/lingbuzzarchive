While the general pattern is crosslinguistically very common, there is much variation in its precise syntax and semantics. In this chapter I review the classic analyses of external possession as possessor raising and possessor binding. The evidence behind these analyses indicates that raising and binding are indeed each appropriate for certain subtypes of external possession, as is an analysis in terms of movement to thematic positions. I propose a novel typology which groups these analyses under the first of two major types of external possession. This first type presents significant parallels to the domain of raising and control, subsuming possessor raising, possessor binding, possessor control and perhaps also a variant of ECM. Examples of this major type are found in Nez Perce, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and English. A second major type of external possession involves subjects only and brings information structural effects. Examples are found in Malagasy, Chickasaw, Tz’utujil, and Japanese.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001799/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001799<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Companion to Syntax, 2nd edition ("Syncom")</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>possessor raising, possessor ascension, government, incorporation, possessor datives, raising, control, ecm, multiple nominative, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001799/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2013]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2033 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001799">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001799">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
