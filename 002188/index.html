This devoicing pattern has been studied extensively in the recent phonological literature, in terms of theoretical modeling as well as from the perspective of experimentation and corpus studies. Less well-known is the observation that /p/ may cause devoicing of geminates as well (e.g. /piramiddo/ => /piramitto/), although to date no objective evidence has been offered to confirm this observation. The current study thus attempts to test this observation objectively, by way of a corpus study and two phonological judgment experiments. All the results generally support the idea that /p/ causes devoicing of geminates in loanwords. In addition to this descriptive discovery, throughout the paper we discuss intriguing task effects in phonological experimentation, by comparing the corpus data and the results of the two experiments. Although our aim is primarily descriptive, we offer some analytical possibilities for the /p/-driven devoicing of geminates toward the end of the pape<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002188/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002188<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Journal of Japanese Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>japanese, geminates, devoicing, /p/, cumulative markedness, task effects, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002188/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2584 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002188">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002188">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
