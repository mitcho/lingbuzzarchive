From usage-based perspective the language system,  is shaped by the linguistic experiences of the normal adult human . These are reflections of the internal complexity of the individual's social life  social interactions which are of three major types: at professional level with colleagues and co-workers, at a personal level with family members, e.g.friends, neighbours, and community members, and  occasional interactions with strangers, i.e fellow humans. The article argues that these 3 types of communicative interactions form three types of sub-systems in language use which co-exist, labeled here as  code-like system, inferential system  and protolanguage-like or  primitive/rudimentary language systems. Acknowledging the fact that the linguistic output of the normal adult language user is structured in reflection of one's communicative experiences, and not a heterogeneous structureless  sum of utterances, as the current dominant orthodoxy presumes, sheds a new light on our  understanding of the language system,  as it is shaped by language use.  Most importantly, starting from these well founded premisses, the article  argues that the innate propensity for learning and processing of  the very essentials of language, i.e. the most primitive  language systems, is  more likely to reflect  the content of  the innate Language Faculty, while the other two subsystems reflect significant participation of a broad range of cognitive resources implicated in some ways in language learning and use.  Such understanding of the Language Faculty  makes the study of language evolution less of a mystery. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006350/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006350<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language faculty, protolanguage, language evolution, language instinct, biolinguistics, foxp2, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>182 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006350">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006350">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
