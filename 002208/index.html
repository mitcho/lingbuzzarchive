types of sentences give rise to a notion of relative truth. In particular, sentences containing predicates of personal taste and moral or aesthetic evaluation as well as epistemic modals are held to express a proposition which is true or false only relative to a standard of taste or knowledge or an agent. This paper argues that the sentences that apparently give rise to relative truth express what I will call ‘first-person-based genericity’, a form of generalization that is based on an essential first-person application of the predicate. The account differs from the standard relative-truth account in crucial respects: it is not the truth of the proposition expressed that is relative to the first person; the proposition expressed by a sentence with a predicate of taste rather has absolute truth conditions. Instead it is the propositional content itself that requires a first-personal cognitive access whenever it is entertained. This account avoids a range of problems that standard relative-truth theories of the sentences in question face and explains a number of further peculiarities that such sentences display.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002208/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002208<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Philosophical Studies (2010) 150:187–220</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>relative truth, generic 'one', first person, de se, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>803 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002208">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002208">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
