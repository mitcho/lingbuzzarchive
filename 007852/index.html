ments that are uttered without the intention to deceive or otherwise break with cooperative communication. Much of the literature on these figures of speech concerns the specific rhetorical roles they play as well as their relation to other tropes, like metaphor and irony. In this work, I intend to study meiosis and hyperbole from a truth-conditional perspective. In particular, I look at how we can define under- and overstatement in terms of the relation between the propositional content and a contextually salient scale. The resulting theory is empirically grounded by empirical tests and formalised in a standard framework of possible world semantics. The advantage of doing this is twofold: (i) it will become possible to provide formal clarity on how to classify certain untruthful utterances and (ii) we can make explicit the role semantic content plays in the deliberate utterance of untruthful statements. I apply the framework in by extending existing probabilistic approaches to hyperbole interpretation using the Rational Speech Act framework.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007852/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007852<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Sinn und Bedeutung 28</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>understatement, meiosis, overstatement, hyperbole, scalarity, untruthfulness, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>149 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007852">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007852">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
