I argue that an examination of polarity focus data pushes us to resolve several challenging topics central to the semantics and pragmatics of focus: truly contrastive focus and its relationship to answer focus, obligatory vs. optional focus and the mechanism that enforces focus marking (maximize presupposition), the relationship between contextually salient antecedents and evoked or accommodated antecedents, and the role of givenness deaccenting. I propose a theory of focus that, building on Katzir 2013, makes use of the notion of innocent exclusion from Fox 2007. But it also builds on Wagner 2006, 2012 and Buring 2016, 2019 by taking focus to impose a true contrast requirement on antecedents, stricter than classically assumed. I also present new evidence for a distinct givenness deaccenting requirement, and show how a general theory of focus applied to polarity focus enables a pragmatic explanation of the inference that verum/polarity focus emphasizes the truth of an utterance. The paper ends with a comparison to previous accounts of verum/polarity focus, pointing out challenges for VERUM operator approaches.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004205/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004205<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>focus, polarity focus, maximize presupposition, verum focus, contrastive focus, answer focus, givenness, semantics, pragmatics, prosody</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004205/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>457 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004205">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004205">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
