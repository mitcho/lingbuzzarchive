of the syntax and semantics of this verbal class has been undertaken for the first time in Japanese linguistics by Tsujimura and Aikawa (1996, 1999), but the fuller examination of the true nature of zi-verbs within the wider context of the theory of argument structure is yet to be conducted. This paper develops a comprehensive theoretical account of object-less zi-verbs in terms of Lexical

Conceptual Structure and its mapping to Argument Structure (Levin and Rappaport-Hovav 1995, among others). Tsujimura and Aikawa treat object-less zi-verbs uniformly as reflexive verbs that have an unaccusative structure. Arguing against their analysis, we provide a variety of syntactic, morphological, and semantic arguments and show that object-less zi-verbs are further classified into three subtypes in terms of their argument structure as (a) transitive, (b) unaccusative and (c) unergative. We also claim that the zi-morpheme that arises in each type of verb has a different function/meaning: the morpheme used in the (a) type of verbs functions as an argument, while it functions as an adjunct in the (b) and (c) types.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001033/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001033<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001033">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001033</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under second round review for publication</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>zi-verbs; reflexivity; argument structure; lexical conceptual structure, morphology, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>147 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001033">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001033">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
