and a nominal complement, such as ‘be like x’ / ‘be like a P’ and ‘look like x’
/ ‘look like a P’. I argue that these constructions have two key properties. (1)
The first is that similarity predication amounts to predication of overlap of salient
properties: I analyze ‘is like x’ as ‘for relevant attributes, has the same value as
x’, where an attribute (e.g. ‘color’) denotes a partition over the universe of indi-
viduals, and possible values for such an attribute (e.g. ‘red’) correspond to cells
of this partition. (2) The second key feature of similarity talk is, I argue, that
it involves generic quantification. This explains a range of data: first, it accounts
for the reading of indefinites embedded in ‘like’ Prepositional Phrases: there is a
reading under which ‘John looks like a lawyer’ is almost equivalent to ‘John looks
like a typical lawyer’. Second, it accounts for narrow-scope and almost conjunc-
tive readings of disjunction in the scope of ‘like’: ‘Mary looks like a lawyer or a
judge’ is almost equivalent (on its most accessible reading) to ‘Mary looks like a
lawyer and Mary looks like a judge’. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006835/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006835<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>similarity, genericity, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>322 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006835">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006835">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
