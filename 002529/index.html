Cinque (1999) proposed that they always occupy the same position above IP and that the various orders are derived via movement of the other phrases around them. This hypothesis can now be refined to account for more fine-grained phenomena. In this paper I consider some contrasts between sentences where these adverbs are associated with a “normal intonation” and other ones, where they associated with a parenthetical, comma, intonation. To provide an account for the distribution of parenthetical adverbs, I resort to Giorgi’s (2011, forthcoming) proposal. I consider parentheticals as syntactically integrated structures, rejecting adjunction and adopting the cartographic approach, based on Kayne’s (1994) Linear Correspondence Axiom. As for the non-parenthetical occurrences, I propose that there are two basic positions for these adverbs, one for each phase: above v*P and above IP (Cinque’s position). The existence of a low left periphery above v*P agrees has also been recently hypothesized for other phenomena in Old (Poletto, 2006 and to appear) and Modern Italian (Belletti, 2004).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002529/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002529<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002529">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002529</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>proceedings of LSRL43, John Benjamins, C.
