We examine three schematic proposals raised in the litera-ture to capture this observation, namely that only vs. even presuppose that the proposi-tion denoted by their prejacent, p, is lower vs. higher, respectively (A) than what is EX-PECTED/the default STANDARD (the ‘mirative/evaluative antonymy’ view), (B) than SOME (salient) alternative in the set of contextually relevant focus alternatives, C, (the ‘existential antonymy’ view), or (C) than ALL alternatives in C (the ‘superlative antonymy’ view). To tease these views apart, we examine the behavior of only vs. even in a wide range of contexts and types of discourse, concentrating on the way previously uttered sentences and the salient QUD interact to constrain the C set of contextually rel-evant alternatives with only (C) (p) and even (C) (p). Based on these examinations we  argue for the preferability of the ‘superlative antonymy’ view of only and even. In con-trast, we argue that the ‘existential’ antonymy and the ‘mirative/evaluative’ antonymy between only and even are apparent. The former only holds in specific contexts where one alternative to p is made maximally salient. As to the latter, we show that while an evaluative (‘above the standard’ / ‘a lot’) inference is hardwired into the scalar presup-position of even, alongside the superlative inference, the mirror imaged one (‘below the standard’ / ‘a little’) is cancellable for only and can be derived from the interaction of its superlative scalar presupposition and domain-based constraints on the alternatives in C.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007091/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007091<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Natural Language Semantics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>only  even  scales  focus  alternatives  mirativity  evaluativity   contextual effects  standards  qud, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>251 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007091">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007091">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
