One general question that is currently explored is what sorts of semantic properties can be symbolically represented. Against this background, within the general research paradigm which explores the nature of sound symbolism using Pokémon names, several recent studies have shown that Japanese speakers associate certain classes of sounds with notions that are as complex as Pokémon types. Specifically, they associate (1) sibilants with the flying type, (2) voiced obstruents with the dark type, and (3) labials with the fairy type. These sound symbolic effects arguably have their roots in the phonetic properties of the sounds at issue, and are hence not expected to be specific to Japanese. The current study thus tested these sound symbolic associations with English speakers. Two experiments show that they can reliably make these three sound symbolic connections, similar to Japanese speakers. These results support the hypothesis advanced by Shih et al. (2019) that those attributes that are important for survival are actively signaled by sound symbolism.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005129/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005129<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted, comments very welcome</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sound symbolism, pokémon types, sibilants, voiced obstruents, [p], phonetics, psycholinguistics, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>75 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005129">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005129">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
