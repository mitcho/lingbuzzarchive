change, and have proposed a number of explanations, usually based on
specific lexical items. This paper takes a different approach, by using a
distributional semantic model to identify and quantify semantic change
across an entire lexicon in a completely bottom-up fashion, and by examining
which distributional properties of words are causal factors in semantic
change. Several independent contributing factors are identified. First, the
degree of prototypicality of a word within its semantic cluster correlated
inversely with its likelihood of change (the “Diachronic Prototypicality
Effect”). Second, the word class assignment of a word correlates with its rate
of change: verbs change more than nouns, and nouns change more than
adjectives (the “Diachronic Word Class Effect”), which we propose may be
the diachronic result of an independently established synchronic
psycholinguistic effect (the “Verb Mutability Effect”). Third, we found that
mere token frequency does not play a significant role in the likelihood of a
word’s meaning to change. A regression analysis shows that these effects
complement each other, and together, cover a significant amount of the
variance in the data.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004233/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004233<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Lingue e Lingguagio 2016</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantics, distributional semantics, semantic change, word embeddings, methodology, controls, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>114 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004233">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004233">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
