SOT has often been considered the morphological expression of the anaphoric nature of subjunctive tenses. Recent discussions on this topic have shown that in some cases subjunctive tenses appear to be independent from the matrix tense and SOT seems to be violated. In this paper I discuss the apparent violations of SOT in Italian and in French and and I try to explain them proposing that depending on the aktionsart and the aspect of the predicate some subjunctive tenses specify the features they must share with their antecedent, some others do not. I propose that the hypothesis here investigated might cast light on the mechanism of SOT itself. Since SOT may be conceived as an agreement mechanism, SOT is predicted to hold if there is a range of morphological competing options having one and the same denotation. A formal device accounting for SOT, tentatively based on Agree, will be finally illustrated and applied to the Italian and French complete paradigms.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000665/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000665<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Rivist di Grammatica Generativa 32 (2007): 39-64</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>sequence of tenses, subjunctive, tense anaphors, agree, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>310 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000665">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000665">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
