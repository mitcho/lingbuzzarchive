It is not, for instance, possible to explicate assertions of the existence of air or oil or water, through the use of quantifiers and variables which take objectual values. The difficulty is attributable to the semantically distinctive status of non-count nouns â nouns which, although not plural, are nonetheless akin to plural nouns in being semantically non-singular. Standard approaches to understanding non-count nouns are however uniformly reductive, construing them as singular expressions which individuate âparcelsâ or âquantitiesâ of stuff â set-like entities satisfying the principles of a mereology. And such approaches find a precise parallel in singularised accounts of the semantics of plural nouns, construed as designating collectivities or sets â accounts which, it is urged, are similarly reductive and also false. Metaphysically, there are no distinctive objects in the extensions of plural nouns; their extensions are identical with those of the corresponding singular expressions. Analogously, there are no distinctive objects in the extensions of non-count nouns; but because there are no corresponding singular expressions in these cases, there are no objects in the extensions of non-count nouns at all. There are, in short, no such things as instances of stuff. Metaphysically, non-singular reference in general is an arbitrary modality of reference, ungrounded in the realities to which it is non-ideally or intransparently correlated. The world of space and time contains not merely large numbers of discrete concrete things or individuals of diverse kinds; it also contains large amounts of sheer undifferentiated concrete stuff.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000265/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000265<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS WEBSITE</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>non-count reference, non-singular descriptions, uniqueness, exhaustiveness, exclusiveness, predicate calculus, non-singular quantification, reduction, non-singular variable, variable, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>105 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000265">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000265">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
