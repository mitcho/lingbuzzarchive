Harmlessly, “KFC” and “Stop” are illegal signs there, but more terrifyingly, there have been independence movements and terrorists attacks against Canada. However, these problems, which are rooted in language, have seen little statistical research: As of 2019, only 2 sociolinguistic research are somewhat relevant. My research ﬁlled this gap by statistically testing Quebecois’ beliefs towards French and English.

I created and sent a questionnaire to choristers from multiple choirs across Quebec, and students from the Université de Montréal, whose ages ranged between 18 and 78. The results showed that 1) Quebecois French (QF) has high prestige among most Quebecois, who believe 2) that anglicisms contaminate French, 3) believe that they must protect French’s place in Quebec, but 4) do not believe that French is more precise than other languages. Based on these conclusions and a recent corpus examination, I predict that in the future, 1) QF will differ even further from Parisian French in lexicon and sound, 2) Quebec language laws will weaken, and 3) anglicisms will continue to exist in QF.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005326/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005326<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>quebec, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005326/v1.file">v1 [May 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>242 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005326">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005326">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
