This scientific thesis may be right or wrong, and can only be questioned by taking into consideration its empirical coverage and the logic of its arguments. At the core of this issue is the Poverty of Stimulus Argument (PSA), whose logic has been deeply misunderstood by many anti-nativists, such as, for instance, Geurts (2000), who fails to recognize the relevance of the distinctions between knowledge and belief, and between conscious and unconscious cognition, which are crucial to the full understanding of the logic of the PSA. The aim of this paper is to clarify this particular misunderstanding.</p>
