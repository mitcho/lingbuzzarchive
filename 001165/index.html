The EPP feature has been an annoying problem ever since it was originally formulated to describe the obligatory presence of expletives in the subject position, namely SPEC-T, of English-type languages if nothing raises to that position, as Chomsky (2005: 22) admits. In this paper, by accounting successfully for the derivations of several well-known EPP-related 

cnstructions which have been widely known to need the EPP feature, such as expletive constructions, subject-to-subject raising constructions, and ECM constructions, without any reliance on the EPP feature, the EPP feature turns out to be not only conceptually but empirically unnecessary. As Chomsky (2005: 22) says, by eliminating a kind of stipulation, EPP, we can take another step towards the goals of the MP.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001165/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001165<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Draft, comments welcome</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>epp, phase, probe, goal, parallel movement, expletive construction, raising construction, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001165/v1.pdf">v1 [December 2010]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>508 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001165">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001165">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
