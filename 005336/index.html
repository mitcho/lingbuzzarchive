In simple sentences, binding from Spec,TP is not possible, suggesting that Spec,TP is an A’-position. But in raising constructions, a subject may seemingly bind an anaphor within an experiencer-PP from Spec,TP: this is a property associated with A-positions. This paradox is dubbed the "Balinese Bind" (BB) by Wechsler. We have two goals: first, we present novel evidence showing that awakne, the complex anaphor, is at least optionally interpreted as a logophor in any syntactic context. Second, we argue that awakne must be interpreted as a logophor in the Balinese Bind construction, and adopting Charnavel (2019)’s analysis, we argue that the experiencer anaphor is actually bound by a local perspectival center, and not from Spec,TP, providing a novel solution for the BB problem in a minimalist framework. In addition, such interpretive constraints cannot be accounted for by either Wechsler, or Levin (2014)’s agree-based solution of the BB. We conclude by noting that the data presented here contradicts a crosslinguistic generalization made by Haspelmath (2008) among others.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005336/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005336<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>balinese, binding, anaphora, agreement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>53 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005336">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005336">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
