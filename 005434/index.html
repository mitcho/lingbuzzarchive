Thus, the verb GO in many IA languages can appear as a light verb in verb-verb [VV] compounds, contributing various more functional semantic components including completion.

Although VV compounds are a clear areal feature of South Asia, at lower levels of analysis we find obvious and substantial differences in the structure, interpretation, and frequency of use of VVs across South Asia, including significant differences even between closely related languages. Hindi VVs occur in a more restricted range of contexts , while VVs in Nepali and Marathi are less restricted. The strength of restrictions on licensed environments for VVs appears to co-vary with the frequency of occur of VVs overall. Thus Hindi VVs appear to display an overall greater frequency of occurrence than do Nepali VVs.

In this chapter, I discuss the historical development and properties of VV compounds in IA, with  reference to VVs in Dravidian. Also notable is discussion of VVs in Sinhala, including early Sinhala.
