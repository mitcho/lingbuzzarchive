This article endeavors to examine the word association theory in some common Persian words and their association triggers. To reach the answers to research questions, the ten cue words were classified into three groups: “tools”; “animate”; and “inanimate”. An attempt was made to include the most frequent and least frequent associated words. 24 native Persians all of whom have university education; male and females participated in each task. The data was collected by recording the participants’ voices and then transcription. After hearing each target word, the participants immediately said ten words that first came to their mind. The research findings showed that for the word “food” with 58.33%, the target word: pot; “snow” with 45.83% target word: mountain; “blessing” with 41.66% target word: was bread; the word “noise” with 37.50% target word: neighbor; the word “race” with 33.33%, the target word: horse, the word “sharp” with 33.33%, the target word: knife; “money” with 29.16% target word: father; “kindness” with 29.16% target word: friend; “plant” with 29.16% target word: soil; “kindness” with 29.16%, the target word: girl, represented the associated words with the highest frequency. The evaluation of conceptual structures in the analysis of semantic relations that included the lexical component and association revealed the words associated in the minds of the speakers and confirmed the word association theory in Persian.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007704/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007704<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>researchgate</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>mental lexicon, psycholinguistics, semantic relation, vocabulary knowledge, word association, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>330 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007704">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007704">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
