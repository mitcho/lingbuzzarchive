and controversial post-nasal devoicing rule, which has been cited as a counterexample to the claim
that markedness constraints are phonetically grounded (Hyman 2001). We re-examine the case of
Setswana and argue that it must be analyzed in terms of grounded constraints. Our evidence comes
from two sources. First, we report on the results of a phonetic study of six speakers of the Sengwato
dialect of Setswana. We found that some of our speakers did not have voiced obstruents in any
context. Those speakers that did devoice post-nasally also devoiced in other contexts. Thus, a
phonetic examination of the purported counterexample to phonetically grounded constraints fails
to support the traditional descriptions. Second, we examine the larger phonological context in
which the Setswana alternations occur. Setswana has a gapped system of laryngeal contrasts, so
the evidence for post-nasal devoicing comes almost entirely from labial stops. The language also has
a series of so-called strengthening alternations that affect consonants such as liquids and fricatives
post-nasally—alternations that we propose to analyze in terms of the Syllable Contact Law.
