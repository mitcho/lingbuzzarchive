This notwithstanding, studies on this expression are remarkably scarce. The only attempts to describe its properties are Akar and Öztürk (2020); Akar, Öztürk, Göksel, and Kelepir (2020); Erguvanlı-Taylan (2000). In the present study, we introduce the first formal semantic and pragmatic treatment of clauses containing hani. Unlike previous accounts, we claim that hani can have one of the following two major pragmatic functions: making salient a proposition in the Common Ground or challenging one in a past Common Ground, therefore requiring a Common Ground revision. Despite its variety of occurrences, we argue that hani has a uniform interpretation, and provide a compositional analysis of the different construals that it is associated with. Furthermore, we show that a formally explicit and accurate characterization of hani clauses requires operating on contextual parameters, in particular the utterance time. Therefore, if our proposal is on the right track, hani clauses may provide indirect empirical evidence in favour of the existence of “monstrous” phenomena adding to the accumulating cross-linguistic
evidence in this domain (see Schlenker (2003) and much work since then).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007287/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007287<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Natural Language Semantics (https://rdcu.be/dujZq)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>tense, monsters, common ground, presuppositions, semantics, pragmatics, indexical shift, expressive presuppositions, turkish</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007287/v2.pdf">v2 [September 2023]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/007287/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2023]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>597 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007287">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007287">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
