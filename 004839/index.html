However, experimental work has demonstrated on a number of occasions that ‘transparent’ vowels actually undergo harmony (e.g., Gick, Pulleyblank, Campbell, & Mutaka, 2006), re-establishing the role of locality in the analysis of harmony. Existing work on backness harmony in Uyghur argues that /i/ is transparent to harmony, with some proposing that this falls out from the absence of contrastive /ɯ/ in the language (e.g., Vaux, 2000). This paper examines the distribution of surface [i] and [ɯ] within roots and suffixes to assess their phonological status, as well as their participation in harmony. Results support the case that there are no long-distance dependencies in Uyghur, suggesting that harmony is truly local in the language. Results for root-internal [i] and [ɯ] are less clear; evidence from most speakers supports an allophonic relationship, while some evidence for other speakers suggests the possibility of contrastive /i/ and /ɯ/.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004839/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004839<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Laboratory Phonology</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonology, vowel harmony, locality, transparency, contrast, uyghur, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004839/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>594 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004839">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004839">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
