modular way – narrowing the domain of inquiry in order to allow for increased depth
of study. This is necessary and productive for a topic as wide-ranging and complex as
human language. However, precisely because language is a complex system, tied to perception,
learning, memory, and social organization, the assumption of modularity can
also be an obstacle to understanding language at a deeper level.

The methodological focus of this work is on computational modeling, highlighting
two aspects of modeling work that receive relatively little attention: the formal mapping
from model to theory, and the scalability of demonstration models. A series of
implemented models of sound change are analyzed in this way. As theoretical inconsistencies
are discovered, possible solutions are proposed, incrementally constructing a
set of sufficient properties for a working model. Because internal theoretical consistency
is enforced, this model corresponds to an explanatorily adequate theory. And because
explicit links between modules are required, this is a theory, not only of sound change,
but of many aspects of phonological competence.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004842/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004842<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Language Sciences Press (forthcoming)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>computational modeling; exemplars; diachrony; articulatory phonology; speech perception, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>280 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004842">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004842">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
