Application of this principle accounts for contextual neutralization, a phenomenon that we exemplify with two case studies. One is Basque proclitic realization, in which the case of a pronominal clitic is neutralized according to its linearized position. The second is the realization of Bulgarian definite articles, which neutralize gender distinctions depending on the phonology of the host noun to their left. In understanding this latter pattern, we offer an analysis of the facts presented in Harizanov & Gribanova 2011, in which these definite articles appear to depend on phonology alone when found in conjunction structures with coordinated adjectives. We argue that the latter phenomenon reflects a modularization of Agree into two-steps: a syntactic Agree-Link, and a postsyntactic Agree-Copy, following much recent work (e.g. Bhatt & Walkow, to appear). Lowering of the postposed determiner is interleaved between these two operations, thereby feeding a stage of Agree-Copy in which the closest c-commanding goal is chosen as a value-source. The proposed revisions to the theory of Distributed Morphology within the paper open new roads of inquiry for understanding phenomena often posed as a challenge to phonology-free syntax, as recently discussed in Svenonius (2012).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001690/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001690<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in a volume edited by Marantz and Matushansky</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>distributed morphology, elsewhere principle, basque clitics, bulgarian definite articles, agreement, two-step agree, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>762 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001690">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001690">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
