Remarks on Norbert Hornstein's &quot;Movement and chains&quot;</a></b></font><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000035">Michael Brody</a><br/>June 1999</center>&nbsp;<p></p>There are two main arguments in M&C against chains, one based on the correlation of quantifier scope and binding, the other on the correlation between quantifier scope and thematic properties. Both rest on highly dubious background assumptions. Additionally even granting these assumptions both are flawed in similar ways. There are also numerous additional problems both with H's account of quantifier scope and control and with his arguments against chains. If we take chains to be interpretively constructed, then multiple copies in chains may not differ from other multiple occurences of lexical items (or structures constructed from lexical items) with respect to their origin. In all cases multiple occurences are due to a (set of) element(s) being selected from the lexicon more than once. Multiple occurences can then be interpreted as chains when they are in the (thematically) appropriate type of identity relation. This approach not only dispenses with syntax-internal chains as H justifiably desires, but also eliminates the additional unmotivated, arbitrary and redundant syntactic mechanism of movement that he (and the minimalist framework in general) assumes.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000035/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000035<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>movement, chains, achains, syntax, quantifier raising, control, generalized projection principle</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>288 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000035">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000035">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
