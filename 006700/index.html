Pannkakor är läcker-t 
 (pancake.PL be.PRES delicious-T) ‘It’s delicious to have pancakes.’ T-agreement, as (i), might seem unexpected; predicative adjectives canonically agree in number and gender. I argue that pancake agreement is agreement in non-specificity. The semantic interpretation, as well as restrictions on pancake sentences follow from this: The subject must not be definite or quantified, and the adjective must be of the Individual Level type. The latter is a constraint not previously noted in the literature. 
I argue that similar sentences with plural agreement are also pancake sentences: 
ii. Pannkakor är läckr-a (pancake.PL be.PRES delicious-PL) ‘Pancakes are delicious.’ Basically the same restrictions as for (i) hold for (ii). I argue that the difference is that the subject in (ii) projects for number, whereas the number feature on the subject in (i) is too deeply embedded to project, hence the absence of number agreement. The proposal accounts for the fairly recent historical emergence of pancake sentences with T-agreement; I argue that they arose as a consequence of the loss of verbal agreement.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006700/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006700<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Centre for Languages and  Literature, Lund University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pancake sentences, specificity, bare plurals, the definiteness restriction, stage level predicates, individual level predicates, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>312 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006700">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006700">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
