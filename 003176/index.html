These verb alternations may be correlated with the dialectal presence of the clitic se. Verb classes that exhibit this alternation are typically motion verbs such as caer ‘fall’ and entrar ‘go.in’ and change of state verbs like explotar ‘explode’. ​
According to De Miguel (1999), aspectual se is accepted by motion unaccusatives such as ir 'go' when they denote the event’s initial endpoint, since the initial endpoint (e.g., the origin) is unspecified. Similarly, a verb such as entrar 'go in' would not allow se because it denotes the event’s terminal endpoint while leaving the initial endpoint unspecified. We claim that the verbs under study exhibit extended syntactic frames in Non-Standard varieties that make them compatible with either theme arguments (see e.g., Harley 2011), interpreted as results of change-of-state roots, or goals in the case of motion (change-of-position) roots. The final composition of verbal root plus complement triggers the interpretation of the resulting structure as a complex achievement rather than a simple achievement, licensing an external Causer, which in Spanish may be syntactically realized as se if the argument is morphologically underspecified. The most salient semantic contrast between a complex and a simple achievement has to do with the interpretation of the event as no longer denoting a mere culmination but rather a full change of state or position.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003176/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003176<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Oxford University Press</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>causatives, dialectal variation, inchoatives, alternating verbs, aspectual se, change-of-state verbs, alternating motion verbs, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>188 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003176">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003176">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
