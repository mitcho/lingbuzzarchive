I look at another Slavic language, Russian, further expanding and fine-tuning the typology of how different languages realize various meaning components of different types of speech acts. While, like in Macedonian, Russian canonical YNQs are formed via an "intonation-only" strategy, said intonation doesn't involve a rising tune, but a special prosodic peak that I call the Q-Peak. I show that, despite marking canonical YNQs, the Q-Peak can also be used in friendly, but invested requestsâ€”but not in disinterested suggestions. I propose that the Q-Peak realizes an operator that asks the addressee to react to the speaker's speech act, which is appropriate in (some) questions and invested requests, but not in disinterested suggestions. The Russian Q-Peak is therefore distinct from the English-style rising tune, which in Rudin (& Rudin's) terms, simply "call[s] off the speaker's commitment to their utterance". The latter can thus have a wider range of meaning effects and brings a different source/flavor of politeness/tentativeness to directives.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008389/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008389<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted to 'Proceedings of SALT 34' (preprint)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantics, pragmatics, prosody, yes/no questions, rising declaratives, imperatives, cohortatives, russian, semantics, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>411 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008389">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008389">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
