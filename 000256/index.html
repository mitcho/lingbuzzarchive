adjectival structures. I show that event structure plays a crucial role here, much as it does in NP

predication (see Adger and Ramchand 2003). I propose that the basic meaning for an adjective is

changed fairly radically when it becomes a comparative. Comparatives denote intervals on scales

(following Schwarzschild 2002), and as such, cannot predicate over individuals. Extra functional

structure must be added to allow them to behave in the same way as predicative or attributive

adjectives. I show that there is a fair amount of evidence for this from Scottish Gaelic. To the extent

that the conclusions about the denotations of comparatives are true more widely, this suggests that

there is quite a bit of extra structure at play in predicative and attributive comparatives.
