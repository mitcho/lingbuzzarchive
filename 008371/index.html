proper complement clause, where the complement is headed by a covert/overt FACT (Kiparsky and
Kiparsky 1972). However, if the complement clause ends in a SAY/REPORT C(complementizer) as in
Altaic or a nominal SAY heads the complement (as proposed for SAY/doxastic verbs in English by
Kratzer 2013), then factive presupposition can be cancelled. Thus, factivity alternation for epistemic
predicates is yielded. The non-factive reading is like ‘believe with some evidence that.’ This talk presents
different types of cross-linguistic factivity alternation, mainly the Altaic type, the English (IndoEuropean) type, and the Chinese type. The Altaic type factivity alternation depends on complement
(case) endings, where syntactic factors like the choice of FACT nominalizers vs. SAY complementizers
are crucial for factivity alternation. In the English type, propositional operators such as negation,
interrogative, conditional, modal, and before, and contextual denial with but and not are instead utilized.
For example, Bush doesn’t know that Putin is honest, in its non-factive reading, Putin may not be honest.
In languages like Chinese, where factivity alternation in epistemic predicates such as zhidao ‘know’ is
highly restricted, the focus position is still a crucial factor leading to factivity alternation in the use of
jide ‘remember.’ I report three findings relevant: First, Korean and Japanese have two distinct kinds of
fact: external ‘fact’ with -ta-nun kes (K) and -iu-koto (J) both involving SAY under the ProFactNounn
kes/koto (The Earth turns round – external) and internal ‘fact’ with -nun kes in K and koto in J with no
SAY but personal perception involved, as grammatically distinguished (Wittgenstein earlier said a child’s
‘I know that the Earth turns round’ actually means ‘I learned that the Earth turns round’ in English).
Second, the head nominal and its complement are consistent in factivity: (1) Mia knows the rumor that
Ken kissed Ava. Because the rumor is non-factive, that Ken kissed Ava is non-factive. All head nouns
except the fact are non-factive. Therefore, Vendler’s paradox about why that clause as the object of know
is not presupposed is easily resolved. The third finding of mine is that the preferential whether is
equivalent to expletive negation. The polar interrogative complementizer whether is initially for rogative
verbs such as know but not believe. Its complement P (or not P) is presupposed truth-wise. However,
preferential [or positively biased] attitude predicates such as think, believe, hope, and fear also occur
with whether (White 2021). My finding is that this unusual, psychological use of whether in English is
equivalent to the expletive negation phenomenon in Korean and Japanese. (1K) Mia-nun [caki thim-i
iki-ci anh-ul-kka] sayngkakha-n-ta/kitaiha-n-ta. (2J) Mia-wa [jibun no chimu ga kata-nai ka to]
omou/kitai-suru ‘Mia thinks/expects whether her team will win.’ (If the complement verb is
disadvantageous as ‘lose,’ then the higher embedding predicate must be ‘fear,’ not ‘expect/hope.’). The
content of complement is determining. The counter-factive attitude predicate imagine rarely takes any
real-world factive complements. It typically takes the that complement clause, which I take to be an
unusual SAY-head reportative complement. It reports the imaginer’s creative thinking. Imagine can take
whether but with future/modal but not past, cross-linguistically. The predicate dream is similar in not
dealing with any real-world facts. Na-nun Brigitte Barudot-wa kissu-ha-nun kkwum-ul kkwu-ess-ta ‘I
dreamt a dream in which I kissed Brigitte Bardot.’ A cognate object is used and the tense is a constant
kind used with stage/scene/image, originated from the present. Thus, imagine must be based on the
‘parasitic’ (Grice, Liefke) or rather creative use of language like a metaphor, which associates two
unrelated things or propositions. We can establish semantic universals with FACT-headed complements
(equivalently ProFactNoun kes/koto in K/J) as presupposed, as opposed to SAY-C complements as non21
factive to explain facticity alternation for epistemic attitude predicates (and the same SAY-C for doxastic
predicates) (at times imagine as well to report ‘parasitic’/creative complements). A non-typical use of
whether complementizer is for a psychologically biased use (departing from its original logical use),
equivalent to expletive negation in Korean, Japanese, and French.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008371/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008371<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the UNESCO-CIPSH Conference on Philosophy and Humantities: Keynote speech, Keio Umiversity</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>factivity alternation, epistemic-doxastic, preferential-imaginative attitudes, fact, say, or fiction, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>303 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008371">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008371">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
