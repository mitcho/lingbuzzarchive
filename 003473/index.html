Three problems can be identified as in need of a solution. A first problem pertains to the nature of the minimal information units that make up spatial vision and language. A second problem pertains to the ‘dynamic’ aspects of vision and language, or what visual information to and similar adpositions correspond to. A third problem pertains to how these different types of information are related one another, and what is the status of this ‘interface’, especially within a broader theory of language and cognition. The solution proposed here consists in a formal (model-theoretic) treatment of visual and linguistic information, both static and dynamic, that is couched within (a simplified form of) Discourse Representation Theory. It is shown that this solution is consistent with general theories of cognition and may shed some (novel) light on the nature of the FLN/FLB distinction<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003473/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003473<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Biolinguistics 5.3: 170–225, 2011</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>discourse representation theory; faculty of language in the narrow/broad sense (fln/flb); interfaces; space; vision, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>367 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003473">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003473">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
