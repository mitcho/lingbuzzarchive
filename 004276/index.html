But ‘intensified responses’ (e.g. Sure! / Absolutely! Vs. No way! / Hell no!) received almost no attention within this framework, although they are commonly used. We attempt to make first steps in this direction by examining one specific ‘intensifying response particle’:  The Hebrew legamreyresp ( English absolutely / German absolut).  We follow Greenberg & Wolf 2018 who argued that the assertion speech act operator ASSERT (e.g. Krifka 2014) is inherently gradable, denoting a degree relation between propositions and degrees of credence, and propose that legamreyresp is a degree modifier of ASSERT, which is anaphoric to a proposition asserted / questioned in a previous move in the discourse (cf. Krifka 2013), and (re)-asserts this proposition with a maximal degree of credence. This leads to an effect of “I am completely certain that the previously asserted / questioned proposition is true”. We further show that the proposal has two important advantages: (a) it captures the similarities and differences between the response particle - legamreyresp - and another, propositional use of legamrey (legmareyprop) -  the standard ‘maximizing’ degree modifier of Upper-closed adjectives (completely) and (B) it correctly derives the mixed behavior of legamreyresp relative to that of two other response particles in Hebrew - ken (yes / ja) and naxon (right) - in responses to positive and negative assertions, to polar questions and in conditional antecedents. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004276/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004276<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>NELS 49</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>response particles, speech acts, gradability, assertions, polar questions, negation, modal adverbs, probability, credence, standards, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>199 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004276">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004276">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
