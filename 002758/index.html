In this paper, we demonstrate that clusters containing /s/ in Blackfoot (Algonquian) go well beyond the exceptional behaviour that they display in other languages: in word-initial position, both sC and ssC are found; in medial position, long /s/ is well-formed when flanked by consonants, and overlong /s/ can appear both preceding and following a consonant. None of the approaches mentioned above is suitable for an analysis of /s/ clusters in Blackfoot. Instead, we argue that /s/ in this language patterns not as a special type of contoid but, instead, as a vocoid: it can be underlyingly monomoraic or bimoraic (parallel to short and long vowels), as well as underlyingly non-moraic (parallel to a glide). Like vowels, monomoraic and bimoraic /s/ project their own syllables. We demonstrate that this and other unusual aspects of the syllabification of /s/ does not have to be stipulated: rather, the segmental context in which /s/ occurs, combined with its moraic status, determines its realization, through the application of ordinary constraints on syllabification (place, sonority, hiatus) that are motivated for the language more generally.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002758/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002758<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Appears 2014 in J.
