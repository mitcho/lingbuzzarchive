Particular attention is given to the waxing and waning of ergative properties in Late Middle Indo Aryan and New Indo Aryan, which gives rise to recurring dissociation of case and agreement; specifically, object agreement in the absence of ergative case marking is attested in Kutchi Gujarati and Marwari, while ergative case marking without object agreement is present in Nepali. With regards to case, this article reviews recent insights on how 'ergative/accusative' may be regularly semantically/pragmatically conditioned in Indo-Aryan (so-called Differential Case Marking). Pertaining to agreement, the article investigates a central theoretical question: whether 'ergative' object agreement should be analysed uniformly with subject agreement, or alternatively, as a type of participle agreement â€“ drawing on synchronic parallels between Indo-Aryan and Romance.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005616/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005616<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Linguistics [DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.282]</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>ergativity in indo-aryan, historical ergative, differential case marking, ergative agreement, indo-aryan and romance participle agreement, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>320 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005616">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005616">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
