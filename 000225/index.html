Yablo's paradox consists in a series  {&#60;s(i), [&#8704;k: k&#62;i] ¬Tr(s(k))&#62;: i&#8805;0}, where Tr is the truth predicate and where for each number i the term s(i) denotes the sentence [&#8704;k: k&#62;i] ¬Tr(s(k)). We generalize Yablo's result along two dimensions.

<br>1. First, we investigate the general behavior of the series {&#60;s(i), [Qk: k&#62;i] f[(s(k))k&#8805;i]&#62;: i&#8805;0}, where Q is a generalized quantifier and where f is some fixed truth function. We show that under broad conditions all the sentences in the series must have the same value, and we derive a characterization of those values of Q for which the series is paradoxical.

<br>2. Second, we show that in the Strong Kleene trivalent logic, Yablo's results are a special case of a much more general phenomenon: under certain conditions,  any semantic phenomenon that involves self-reference can be reproduced without self-reference. This is shown by way of a translation which associates to each pair &#60;s, F&#62; in a non-quantificational language L' (where the term s denotes the sentence F) an infinite series of translations {&#60;s(i), [Qk: k&#62;i] [F]k&#62;: i&#8805;0} in a quantificational language L*(where [F]k is a modification of F). We provide a characterization of those values of Q for which the translation goes through, and we discuss various extensions of the translation procedure. The paper, which generalizes recent results by Cook (2004), shows that under certain conditions self-reference is not essential to any semantic phenomena.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000225/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000225<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>300 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000225">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000225">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
