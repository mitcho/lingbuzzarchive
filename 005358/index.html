The voynich contains of plant illustrations and Italian style drawings. It must be a plant
 medicine book according to the illustrations. Although many people tried deciphering it, the 
meaning behind the words still remained mystery. Mostly because we need to find what are the 
alphabets first.

The period manuscript was written could be from 14th to 15th century.However,the letters did 
not look like the languages used in that time. As l looked into ancient alphabets, specially 
Indian ones such as Brahmi, Kharosthi and Gupta; the similar signs were recognizable. 
I want to describe the possibility of how the manuscript can be in Indian languages in brief. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005358/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005358<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>voynich manuscript, voynich, syntax, phonology, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005358/v2.pdf">v2 [August 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005358/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>397 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005358">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005358">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
