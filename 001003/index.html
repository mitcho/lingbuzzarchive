I first show that Radford's data raises an empirical problem with the standard X'-theoretic treatment of adjuncts as sisters to X' dominated by X'. I then argue that the apparent "discontinuous" interpretation of the anaphoric proform receives a straightforward account under the recent label-less theory of adjuncts espoused by Hornstein & Nunes (2008) and Hornstein (2009), whereby the construction of an adjunct may only need concatenation, as opposed to complements and specifiers whose integration requires both concatenation and labeling. This squib not only provides further credence to the view that adjuncts tangle off the syntactic workspace but also calls for an approach that recognizes two related but different notions of constituency: syntactic constituecy vs. semantic constituency.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001003/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001003<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001003">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001003</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>ms.
