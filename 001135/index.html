This variety has three options for wh-questions: full movement into the operator position, partial movement into an intermediate position and in-situ. Contrary to the dominant view that the primary substrate languages of CSE are (southern) Chinese languages (i.e. Mandarin, Cantonese, and Hokkien), these languages have not exerted any substratist influence on the syntax of wh-questions in CSE. Instead, the range of options for wh-questions attested arises from intense language contact between Singapore Malay and this variety. Specifically, following Cole and Hermon&#8223;s (1998) analysis of the typology of wh-questions, I suggest that the substratist transfer took the form of a lexico-syntactic parameterization: an operator is either combined in a single word with a wh-variable or base-generated directly in the scopal operator position, unselectively binding the wh-variable. This analysis correctly predicts a wide range of other syntactic and semantic parallelisms between wh-questions in Singapore Malay and CSE. This result suggests that Singapore Malay is the primary substratal language of CSE with respect to wh-questions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001135/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001135<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>colloquial singapore english, wh-question, movement, wh-in-situ, operator-variable structure, singapore malay, substratist explanation, morphology, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>586 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001135">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001135">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
