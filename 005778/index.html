Secondly, we show that there are similar bases for grammaticalization for Akan (Asante Twi) sɛ and AAA like whereby they have gone from showing resemblance/approximation to serving as quotatives. Thus, we provide examples from AAA and Akan (Asante Twi) to demonstrate correlations between the two quotatives using primary text research and analyses based on a variety of sources placing the putative origin of quotative like into the collective African context. In doing so, we find that both AAA quotative like and Akan (Asante Twi) sɛ are attested prior to what seems to be the relatively recent adoption of AAA's pre-existing quotative into colloquial white American English, which is only first attested in the 1980s. We also find that quotative like and sɛ follow 1 We would like to thank the organizers and participants of the 8 th Linguistics Association of Ghana Annual Conference held in Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi, for the opportunity to present and discuss our ideas in this paper. However, all errors remain our own. 2 The commonly used term African-American is a marker of the integrationist tradition among Black people in the United States. However, we are of the view that the quotative like construction-before being absorbed into colloquial (white) American speech-was more reflective of the Anti-American African tradition in which Africans consciously and subconsciously maintained a distinct African identity in the face of enslavement, oppression and Eurasian linguistic and cultural hegemony. Also, due to the pioneering work of linguists like Lorenzo Dow Turner (1949), it has been demonstrated that varieties of speech of Africans of the Diaspora have maintained aspects of African languages from throughout the continent while conscientiously and sub-conscientiously remaining distinct from Standard (white) American English-a remarkable feat considering the extenuating circumstances under which they exist. Thus, Anti-American African (AAA) is preferred to other terms in the literature such as so-called African American Vernacular English/Black English.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005778/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005778<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ghana Journal of Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>quotative like, anti-american african, grammaticalization, resemblance/approximation, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>247 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005778">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005778">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
