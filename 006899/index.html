This then leads to the question: can Zoom-recorded data be used more-or-less interchangeably with standard recording procedures? The present research is an analysis of vowel acoustics in the Yiyang dialect of Xiang (Sinitic), comparing across two recording mediums: one online (Zoom) and another in person (Sound Booth). Research of Xiang varieties has been made increasingly difficult during the pandemic. This study analyzes two recordings retelling the events of the ‘Pear Stories’ video, performed by a speaker of Yiyang Xiang (Female, 24, college educated) one recorded in the sound-booth at the University of Hong Kong and another recorded through Zoom using a laptop microphone. Acoustic features analyzed include F1, F2, and F3. Preliminary findings suggest that while F1 is fairly comparable, the higher two formants are altered in ways that question the comparability of Zoom-recorded vs. Sound booth-recorded vowels. However, a good degree of comparability is possible for most of the vowels if results are collected by hand. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006899/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006899<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistics Vanguard</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>xiang chinese, recording methodology, acoustic phonetics, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>128 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006899">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006899">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
