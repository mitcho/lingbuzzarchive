Rendaku is voicing of initial consonants of second members of compounds (e.g. /tako/ ‘octopus’ → /oo-dako/ ‘big octopus’). Recent experiments identified a hitherto unnoticed factor that inhibits rendaku: when rendaku results in adjacent identical CV moras, rendaku applicability is reduced (e.g., */iga+gamoke/ from /iga/+/kamoke/). However, these previous studies have only tested the Identity Avoidance effect at the moraic level. 


The current study tests whether Identity Avoidance at the consonantal level, which is more familiar from restrictions found in many Semitic languages, also affects the applicability of rendaku. The current study shows that, although its effect is weaker than the moraic Identity Avoidance, speakers avoid identical consonants in adjacent syllables (e.g. */iga+gomoke/ from /iga/+/komoke/). The current study overall offers the following new understanding about Japanese phonology and general phonological theory: (i) renkdau is subject to the consonantal Identity Avoidance effect, which is a new descriptive discovery (ii) a restriction that is operative at Semitic languages is also operative in Japanese, revealing an intriguing cross-linguistic parallel (iii) Identity Avoidance at different phonological levels coexist within a single language, and (iv) the strength of the avoidance effect correlates with the degree of similarity. Finally, although rendaku has a long research tradition, these effects of Identity Avoidance were not known. The current findings therefore highlight the importance of experimentation in phonological research.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002139/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002139<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted.
