Languages vary regarding the type of elliptical phrases they offer. Spanish presents a rich variety of ellipses in the sentential domain that are also attested in many other languages, even far typologically (sluicing, stripping, gapping, and fragment answers).  In addition, the language also licenses elliptical constructions that are more restricted cross-linguistically. One of such constructions is TP-ellipsis with clitic-left dislocated remnants, a kind of ellipsis licensed through the polarity head in which the remnant (or remnants) is a contrastive clitic-left dislocated topic. The behavior of clitics within the ellipsis site is contrasted with doubling clitics in fragments answers and gapping in order to extract some conclusions regarding the nature of clitic doublings in Rioplatense Spanish. Unlike the great variety of TP-ellipses Spanish has, the language does not make use of lower sentential ellipses, in particular, the language lacks VP-ellipsis both with auxiliary and verb stranding. This absence of VP-ellipsis is correlated with the absence of VP-fronting. Other elliptical constructions in the sentential domain, modal ellipsis and PredP-ellipsis (i.e., the complement of copular verbs), correlate with the possibility of fronting the complement of the relevant modal or of the Predicate Phrase, although in the case of modal predicates the availability of ellipsis or fronting depends on that the modal predicates do not suffer restructuring. In the nominal domain, NP-ellipsis is the most productive ellipsis in Spanish. The construction shares all the properties of the so-called non-local anaphora (e.g., English VP-ellipsis or pseudo-gapping), i.e., it can occur long-distance, across the discourse and in a variety of embedded clauses, including syntactic islands. Nominal features like gender and number behave different under NP-ellipsis: whereas number features can mismatch with the number features in the antecedent, gender features must be identical in the ellipsis site and the antecedent. Rioplatense Spanish presents new evidence that the case feature of the elided noun can vary with the case feature of the noun antecedent, providing support for the idea that nouns are born with genitive case.           <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007761/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007761<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>rioplatense spanish, ellipsis, clitic doubling, quantificational nominal modifiers, tp-ellipsis, np-ellipsis, vp-ellipsis, modal ellipsis, predp-ellipsis, clitic left dislocation, identity, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>187 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007761">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007761">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
