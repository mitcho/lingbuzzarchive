This papers argues that natural language reflects not only the ontology of ordinary objects, but also a language-driven ontology, which is involved in the mass-count distinction and part-structure-sensitive semantic selection (as well as perhaps the light ontology of pleonastic entities in the sense of Schiffer). The language-driven ontology does not constitute another level of representation, but is taken to be a (selective) ontology of the real, given a plenitudinous or maximalist conception of reality, which has been advocated by a number of philosophers. The language-driven ontology aligns closely with the functional part of grammar and a commitment to it is mandatory with the use of language. This gives rise to a novel view according to which part of ontology (ontology of the real) should be considered part of universal grammar on a broadened understanding.
     The paper recasts my older theory of situated part structures without situations, in purely ontological terms, making use of a primitive notion of unity.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005094/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005094<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in James Miller (ed.): The Language of Ontology.
