The standard theory of Japanese accent (cf. Kubozono 2011) argues for the accent on the (ante)penultimate mora, but in opposition to that argument, in this paper I contend that Japanese has word-initial stress as well as an optional pitch-fall accent (cf. Duanmu 2008). I point out that traditional Japanese uses alliteration rather than rhyme in verse such as waka (Japanese short poetry), and that the fixed pitch pattern LHH.. is used in a waka (Japanese short poem) in karuta (playing cards) tournaments, irrespective of the natural pitch patterns. I argue that the fixed pitch pattern emphasizes the word-initial/phrasal-initial strength. The fact that Japanese poetry uses alliteration is in keeping with the word order in Japanese, which has a consistent head-final order (e.g. object-verb, noun-postposition). Then, Japanese is not a counterexample to the typological generalization that languages with alliteration have initial stress in words, compounds and phrases, and a head-final order (e.g. object-verb), as Donegan and Stampe (1983) argue.
