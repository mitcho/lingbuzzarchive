Secondly, we show that there are similar bases for grammaticalization for Akan (Asante Twi) sɛ and AAA like whereby they have gone from showing resemblance/approximation to serving as quotatives. Thus, we provide examples from AAA and Akan (Asante Twi) to demonstrate correlations between the two quotatives using primary text research and analyses based on a variety of sources placing the putative origin of quotative like into the collective African context. In doing so, we find that both AAA quotative like and Akan (Asante Twi) sɛ are attested prior to what seems to be the relatively recent adoption of AAA’s pre-existing quotative into colloquial white American English, which is only first attested in the 1980s. We also find that quotative like and sɛ follow similar trajectories in terms of grammaticalization. In conclusion, we argue that quotative sɛ and like represent a common African source of a similar linguistic phenomenon.   <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003792/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003792<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Ghana Journal of Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>quotative like, anti-american african, grammaticalization, resemblance/approximation, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>124 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003792">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003792">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
