The two main cases to be considered are control in to-complements and subject extraction out of that-clauses (and finite ones in general). It is argued that an analysis of to and also that as nominal elements can account for the role they play in the realization and interpretation of the subject. In particular, it is argued that to can subsume that realization of the embedded subject and accordingly mediate its interpretation, while that requires a lexical subject in the embedded clause so that its complement counts as a proposition. Absence of a lexical subject, as in wh-extraction, fails to meet this requirement, giving rise to ungrammaticality.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000390/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000390<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>complementizer, subject extraction, control, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>677 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000390">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000390">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
