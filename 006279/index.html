A friendly syntactic amendment to dynamic semantics</a></b></font><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006279">Dmitry Privoznov</a><br/>October 2021</center>&nbsp;<p></p>This paper contributes to the discussion of whether pragmatic phenomena are sensitive to the syntactic structure. It considers discourse anaphora (an anaphoric relation between an indefinite that introduces a text-level discourse referent and a pronoun) and argues that it is restricted by the syntactic structure, rather than surface linear order. The paper argues that discourse anaphora does not ``proceed'' from left to right, but rather from any specifier to its sister and from any adjunct to its sister. This is called the Island Condition. Specifiers and adjuncts form a natural syntactic class both by definition and empirically, because they are strong islands for movement. The paper assumes the so-called Spell Out theory of specifier and adjunct islands, proposed by Johnson (2003) and developed in Privoznov (2021). According to this theory, all specifiers and all adjuncts must be spelled out, before they are merged with the rest of the sentence. This also means that all specifiers and all adjuncts are interpreted by the semantic interface before their sister. The paper proposes to derive the Island Condition from this fact. The Island Condition can be integrated as a friendly amendment into any theory of discourse anaphora. For concreteness, the paper shows how it could be incorporated into the classical dynamic semantics (Heim 1982).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006279/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006279<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>discourse anaphora, dynamic semantics, strong islands, spell out, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>439 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006279">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006279">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
