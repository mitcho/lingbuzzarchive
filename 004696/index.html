We provide new evidence for this position and define a new triggering rule. On the empirical side, we show that presuppositions are productively generated from iconic expressions that one may not have seen before, which suggests that some triggering algorithm is indeed called for. Turning to normal words, we show that sometimes a presupposition p is triggered by a simple or complex expression that does not even entail p: it is only when contextual information guarantees that the entailment goes through that the presupposition emerges. On standard theories, this presupposition could not be hardwired, because if so it should make itself felt (by way of projection or accommodation) in all cases. Rather, a triggering algorithm seems to take the contextual meaning as input and turn some contextual entailments into presuppositions. On the theoretical side, we propose that an entailment q (possibly a contextual one) of an expression qq' is treated as a presupposition if q is an epistemic precondition of the global meaning, in the following sense: usually, when one learns that qq' (e.g.  x stops q-ing), one antecedently knows that q (e.g. x q-ed).  Presuppositions thus arise from an attempt to ensure that information that is cognitively inert in general experience is also trivial relative to its linguistic environment. On various analyses, q is trivial in its linguistic environment just in case q is entailed by its local context; this provides a direct link between presupposition generation and presupposition projection. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004696/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004696<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>presuppositions, triggering problem, iconic semantics, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/004696/v4.pdf">v4 [August 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004696/v3.pdf">v3 [August 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004696/v2.pdf">v2 [July 2019]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/004696/v1.pdf">v1 [July 2019]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>498 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004696">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004696">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
