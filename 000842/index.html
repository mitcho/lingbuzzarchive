In the first type, the locative expression appears in preverbal position and the verb agrees with it in the same way that a canonical preverbal subject would, while the logical subject appears in an immediate postverbal position and itself triggers no agreement on the verb. And in the second type, the locative is a topic and the verb bears locative expletive agreement. The properties of locative inversion in several different Bantu languages are brought together in Demuth and Mmusi (1997). In all of the languages discussed there, the inverted located appears in locative form (such as with a preposition or locative noun class morphology) and the verb has subject agreement corresponding to locative noun class 16, 17, or 18, in what can be termed formal locative inversion. The purpose of this paper is to fit languages like Zulu (S40, South Africa) and Tharaka (E54, Kenya) into the typology. These languages have a type of locative inversion (semantic locative inversion) in which a noun denoting a place or space, such as school, raises to subject position in its canonical form, without any concomitant locative morphology. Accommodation of these languages requires further refinement of other parameters of the locative inversion typology and raises questions concerning the languages already included in it.
