At least since Heim et al. (1991), reciprocity is often reduced to the combination of a quantificational distributor (e.g., each) with a reciprocating anaphoric element. In addition, the distributor is often assumed to undergo (covert) movement in order to distribute over its antecedent. In this paper, we focus on the syntax of the largely understudied discontinous reciprocal
construction in Modern Greek, which wears bipartiteness on its sleeve: it consists of two syntactically independent nominals, the distributor o enas ‘the one’ and the reciprocator o alos ‘the other’. Alongside showing that the two elements are truly syntactically independent, we provide a detailed analysis of the locality properties of the construction. We show that the two reciprocal parts can be separated from the antecedent by islands, which leads us to conclude that
they cannot be related by means of movement/Agree. Furthermore, we argue that our data speak in favor of a more traditional definition of the binding domain that is characterized by the presence of a subject (in an abstract sense, viz., a DP in Spec,vP/TP/PredP). Finally, we argue that the different locality restrictions governing the distribution of distributor and reciprocator fall out straightforwardly if the former is analyzed as a floating quantifier and
the latter as a plain anaphor.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007275/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007275<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of NELS 53</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>reciprocals, modern greek, binding theory, agree, movement, locality, scope, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>451 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007275">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007275">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
