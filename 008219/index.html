It is both a bio-cognitive property of the human mind and a communicative technology with the primary function of communication, both brain-internal interconnections among neuronal networks, and interpersonal information exchanges.  
The evolution of language is a process of adaptation to multiple environments, both internal to the individual's processing and learning mechanisms, and external, i.e. socio-cultural influences of  populations. Thus it must adapt to both the human mind and its processing demands and the socio-cultural climate. 
During the multiple millennia since its origination language co-evolved with its environment, both internal and external. It has adapted to fit the human body and mind for efficient learning and processing, and in the process has also altered the human organism to fit language-relevant functions. Language has also evolved in response to the external environment by diversification to fit the specific communicative circumstances of communities in a process of mutual adaptation as historical, cultural, economic and technological environments change. <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008219/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008219<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>evolution, modern synthesis, functionalism, language faculty, adaptation, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>172 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008219">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008219">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
