Formal syntax and semantics, for instance, have not been popularized like physics, chemistry or other hard sciences, and have very rarely found a space in science museums. In this paper we discuss some aspects of this problem, focusing on syntax and its potential in education, and arguing that the lack of popularization derives from the need for different methods of dissemination. To overcome this problem, we present a completely novel approach to syntax education, based on a physical, hands-on multilingual model which we have designed and built. The model, called Puzz-ling, consists of a set of tiles that can be combined only to form grammatical sentences, in three languages (English, German and Italian). A simple set of rules and symbols and a string-reordering system based on constituent swapping derives the correct word order in all three languages. The model introduces in a simple and entertaining form some key concepts of (generative) syntax (e.g. tree structures, binary branching, movement), and displays in an intuitive way the structural difference among languages. The system can be turned into a game with the addition of points and turns, resulting in a hands-on, “edutainment” approach to language. The mechanics of the game are briefly described, and various trade-offs encountered in the design phase are discussed.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004045/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004045<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Language and Linguistic Compass</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, edutainment, multilingualism, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>368 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004045">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004045">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
