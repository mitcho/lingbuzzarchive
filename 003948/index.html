This course provides an introduction to truth-conditional, compositional semantics of natural language. It has a formal component that introduces set theory, propositional logic, and predicate logic. Using these tools, the course investigates various natural language phenomena, such as nominal and verbal modifiers, referential expressions, quantifiers, tense and aspect, modals, propositional attitudes, presuppositions and implicatures, focus, and indexicals. The course is based primarily on Paul Portner’s textbook ‘What is Meaning? Fundamentals of Formal Semantics’, and draws on some additional sources such as Elizabeth Coppock and Lucas Champollion’s draft textbook ‘Invitation to Formal Semantics‘ and various handbook articles.

The original version was developed by Maria Esipova and Lucas Champollion and taught as LING-UA 4 ‘Introduction to Semantics’ at NYU Linguistics in Fall 2017 and Fall 2018. It was subsequently adapted by Nadine Theiler for a slightly shorter course without a teaching assistant or recitation sections and taught as LING 3410Q ‘Semantics’ in Fall 2019. The homeworks in Theiler’s version were optimized for easy online submission and grading.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003948/current.html">html</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003948<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Standalone website</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>nominal and verbal modifiers, referential expressions, quantifiers, tense and aspect, modals, propositional attitudes, presuppositions and implicatures, focus, indexicals, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2513 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003948">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003948">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
