Stative (a.k.a. “adjectival”) passives like _opened_ in _the opened door_, or _flattened_ in _the metal is flattened_, have provided an interesting testing ground for questions of this type. Following a period in which such passives were argued to be formed lexically, much subsequent work has developed the idea that they are derived syntactically, in fully phrasal structures. This paper examines a number of properties of English stative passives which raise problems for a fully phrasal treatment. These include (but are not limited to) (i) modification asymmetries relative to eventive passives; and (ii) interactions with _un_-prefixation. The generalizations that are revealed suggest that stative passives are built syntactically, but without phrasal internal structure: what I call _small(er)_ syntax. Importantly, small structures are not tantamount to a lexical analysis; I provide a direct comparison that argues that the evidence favors the smaller type of approach. The argument for small structures also has implications for the syntax of Roots that are introduced throughout the discussion.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007332/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007332<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>for _Acta Linguistica Academica_</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>word formation, syntax vs.lexicon, stative passive, roots, complex head, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>294 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007332">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007332">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
