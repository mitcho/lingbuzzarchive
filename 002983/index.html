Most analyses focus on the use of response particles as answers to polar questions as well as (to a lesser extent) as responses to affirmations. In this paper, I extend the empirical domain to explore the use of response markers as responses to other clause types including wh-questions, imperatives, and exclamatives. It is established that response particles can be used as (dis)agreement markers. Moreover it is shown that in German, response particles can also be used to mark the following utterance as a response. A unified analysis is developed according to which the difference in function of response markers is syntactically conditioned. Following recent work on the syntax of speech acts an articulated speech act layer is utilized to derive these functions.  The case is made for a more fine-grained typology of response markers than previously assumed.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002983/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002983<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>edited volume for Language Science Press</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>response particles, syntax of speech acts, multi-functionality, syntax-pragmatics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>424 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002983">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002983">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
