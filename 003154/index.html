The metalinguistic theory of names is claimed as being superior in non-trivial ways to direct reference theories, according to which names contribute an individual without the mediation of descriptions (Kripke 1980). The alleged triumph of predicativism is that by assuming the “being called N” property as basic, both referential and non-referential uses of names can be given a uniform semantic analysis. The referentialist needs instead to resort to homonymy or semantic ambiguity. The goal of this paper is to show that the uniformity argument does not hold and that the adduced linguistic evidence cannot lead to any meta-semantic consideration. Polysemy in the realm of names is exactly what is expected under the assumption that grammatical categories and the associated meanings that they are supposed to encode are not grammatical primitives, but epiphenomena that result from the particular way in which syntax combines functional material and lexical Roots. Before syntax, lexical Roots have no detectable meanings; they only point to a Polysemy Space that it is distinguished by means of syntax. So, under this account, which I call the allosemy view (Marantz 2013), there are no names before syntax, as there are no nouns, verbs or adjectives. Names are thus seen as the result of a particular syntactic configuration whose semantic realization is that of contributing an individual. Metalinguistic uses of names, and other derived uses, are involved in a different syntactic scheme, one that makes a name Root a predicate of a certain type. As I will show, the predicativist predicament is based on a misconception of how lexical Roots are identified in linguistic theory. The uniformity argument vanishes under the umbrella of the allosemy theory. Under closer inspection, the linguistic evidence point, instead, in favor of referentialism, as already argued by Longobardi (1994). Following his and others insights, I will provide new empirical arguments coming from the syntax of Spanish names in favor of the hypothesis that derived uses of names require some sort of syntactic transformation (Chomsky 1965). The semantic effects of derived uses of names would follow from the meaningless character of name Roots and certain particular processes of deferred interpretation (Nunberg 1004, Jeshion 2015).          <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003154/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003154<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>predicativism, referentialism; allosemy, distributed morphology; functional morphemes; roots; polysemy, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>414 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003154">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003154">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
