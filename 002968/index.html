derivations in Across The Board (ATB) contexts. There is clear evidence in 
Zurich German that gap and resumptive relatives involve different derivations: 
while gap relatives involve movement, resumptive relatives involve  
base-generation. I will argue that the combination of gaps and resumptives in 
ATB can be compared with well-established cases of asymmetric LF-movement 
in coordination and thus calls for a representational definition of the CSC. 
I will then extend asymmetric extraction to bona fide cases of ATB. Evidence 
for asymmetric extraction comes from reconstruction asymmetries between 
the two conjuncts: Reconstruction into the first conjunct is systematic while 
reconstruction into the second is only partial. This pattern is argued to follow from an ellipsis operation that deletes the extracted elements in the second conjunct under identity with those in the first. The reconstruction asymmetries are the result. of mismatches between the two conjuncts that are independently known to be tolerated in ellipsis. By means of a derivational implementation based on Agree ellipsis is adequately restricted. The present analysis thus reduces ATB to independently available operations and offers a uniform perspective on seemingly diverse phenomena.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002968/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002968<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>In Peter Ackema, Rhona Alcorn, Caroline Heycock, Dany Jaspers, Jeroen van Craenenbroeck & Guido Vanden Wyngaerd (eds.): Comparative Germanic Syntax: The State of the Art.
