One of the fundamental claims of these critics is that traditional acceptability judgment collection methods, lead to an intolerably high number of false negative results (i.e., low statistical power). We empirically assessed this claim by re-testing 95 phenomena that span the full range of effect sizes in syntactic data, estimated from two recent large scale acceptability surveys (Sprouse and Almeida, to appear, and Sprouse, Schutze, and Almeida, submitted) using two different tasks (magnitude estimation, which is commonly used in formal experiments, and forced-choice, which is commonly used in traditional methods), and using resampling simulations to empirically estimate false negative rates (statistical power) for each phenomenon at every sample size between 5 and 100 participants. Contrary to the claims of critics, these results suggest that traditional methods have a remarkably low false negative rate by experimental psychology standards, and in fact are more sensitive than formal experiments at detecting differences between conditions. We discuss the implications of these results for questions about the reliability of syntactic data, as well as the practical consequences of these results for the methodological options available to syntacticians.
