In the "associated motion" construction in Santiago Laxopa Zapotec (Oto-Manguean, Oaxaca), verbs marked with certain prefixes (the venitive and andative) indicate that the event denoted by the verb is preceded by a motion event of coming or going. It is shown that within this construction, (i) a sequence of sub-events lacking temporal adjacency are nevertheless presented as a single meta-event, and (ii) subjects are required to be intentional participants. To deal with these puzzles, the analysis proposed (i) takes the sub-events to be related via a temporally diffuse causal relation (enablement) and (ii) proposes that intention is derived from an entailment that the entire meta-event is the result of an intentional state held by the subject (a plan). Further discussion highlights how associated motion resembles a larger class of exceptionally complex events which also require intentionality, suggesting that plans may underpin a unified theory of exceptional event complexity.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006173/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006173<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Forthcoming in Proceedings of WCCFL 39</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>events, decomposition, causation, motion, associated motion, serial verbs, enablement, intention, oto-manguean, zapotec, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>373 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006173">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006173">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
