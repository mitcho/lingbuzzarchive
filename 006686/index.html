The first part addresses the syntax and argues that Igbo has two types of resumptive pronouns (RPs): (i) RPs that terminate base-generation A'-dependencies, and (ii) RPs that occur at the bottom of A'-movement dependencies.  While similar splits have been claimed to exist in a few other languages -- a claim established with a limited data set (usually island-sensitivity and/or reconstruction) -- Igbo provides pervasive evidence for the co-existence of both types of RPs within the same language: type-(ii) RPs occur in all A'-movement dependencies, and there is comprehensive evidence from all major movement tests, including also cyclicity effects, parasitic gap licensing, and language-specific
diagnostics. We pursue a spell-out approach to type-(ii) RPs Ã  la Pesetsky (1998), Landau (2006) and discuss potential reasons behind their restricted distribution: type-(ii) RPs only surface in PPs, DPs, and &Ps, which are thus not (absolute) islands in Igbo. (In fact, Igbo can be added to the list of languages that allow for the extraction of entire conjuncts, but not for subextraction from a conjunct, which provides further evidence that the two parts of the Coordinate Structure Constraint have to be separated.) 
The second part of the paper deals with the morphological side of resumption, viz., with phi- and (alleged) case mismatches between the RP and its antecedent. The phi-mismatch provides further evidence for the co-existence of the two types of RPs in Igbo. Moreover, it is relevant from a typological perspective since it is more complex than the mismatches reported so far in the resumption literature: the (im)possibility to lose phi-information depends on the type of antecedent (pronoun/lexical noun, coordination). This pattern poses a challenge for previous accounts of phi-mismatches with movement-derived RPs that are based on static deletion domains and/or MaxElide. We propose that the cross-linguistic variation in phi-mismatches can be captured in a partial copy deletion approach along the lines of van Urk (2018) if the amount of structure that is deleted is defined dynamically (viz., it is context-dependent). This further supports the relevance of dynamic domains in morphosyntax, in particular in postsyntactic operations, as previously identified in other areas e.g., in Moskal's (2015b) work on contextual allomorphy. Finally, we show that the 'case' mismatch is a consequence of the (supra)segmental nature of the relevant exponent and the relative timing of the (post)syntactic operations involved.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006686/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006686<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Natural Language and Linguistic Theory</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>resumption, a'-movement, phi-mismatches, partial copy deletion, dynamic domains, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>379 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006686">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006686">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
