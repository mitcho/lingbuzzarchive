The main claim is that "kathe", as well as its English counterpart "every"are only specified for distributivity, not universality-in other words, they do not encompass a universal operator. Instead of that, the analysis indicates that there are different sentential operators that bind (the corresponding) different types of variables on the NP and VP. In more detail,"kathe" NPs exhibit a universal distributive "every" reading (definite use), a Free Choice "any" (indefinite use) and a kind interpretation. "O kathe" NPs exhibit a universal distributive "each" NP reading (familiar and definite use), a Free Choice "any" NP one and an Indiscriminative Free Choice "just any" reading (indefinite uses). In line with previous proposals for "every", I suggest that "kathe" determiners do not lexicalize a universal operator. Following Szabolcsi (2010) on "every" NPs, I argue that "(o) kathe" NPs are (inherently) indefinite expressions (in the sense of Heim 1982) that make part of a quantificational concord. A distributive operator binds the element variables of their NP set; a clause-typing operator in the left periphery, a Definiteness, a Generic or a Modal Operator binds the context set variables of the NP, rendering a universal, a kind or an FC reading to the expression, accordingly. The presence of different sentential operators under C determines the readings that arise. I argue that binding by these operators corresponds to two Agree operations in syntax: One is between the Distributive operator in C and Q on the DP as well as with Aspect on the vP. The other one is between the sentential operator and the relevant feature on Q but also on TP/ vP. The quantificational chains formed are argued to be, to some extent, similar to that of wh- chains.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002771/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002771<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>November 2014</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>quantification, every, any, distributivity, universal operator, generative syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>575 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002771">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002771">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
