In this paper, I argue that at least in diachronic investigations of productivity, a measure based on first attestations is a viable alternative to hapax-based measures. I show that such a measure is a more direct proxy to new words than hapax-based measures â€“ it measures what we want to measure, which is not always true for the latter. I present a method that deals with the common problem of varying sub-corpus sizes (I suggest we randomly resample the sub-corpora up to a predefined size), and to the problem of old words appearing as new at the start of the corpus (I suggest we take an earlier corpus and determine a point in time when almost all old words have registered). Armed with these instruments, we can determine the ratio of new types to existing types for a time span, which can be regarded as the renewal rate of the respective category.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004436/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004436<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>productivity, word-formation, diachronic morphology, new words, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>410 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004436">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004436">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
