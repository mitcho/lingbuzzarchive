The major objectives were to analyze and compare teaching methods used by English teachers in public and private schools and evaluate their efficacy in developing active English language skills in the students. The population of this research consisted of 100 English language teachers from both public and private institutes at the secondary level in south Punjab. The sample included 50 English teachers from private sectors and 50 English teachers from public schools. A simple random technique was adopted to get the results of the research. Two questionnaires, one for the teachers and one for the students, and a classroom observation checklist were designed to accumulate research data. A Five-point rating scale was used to design the questionnaires; the data was collected and tabulated using techniques like descriptive, inferential and t-test. The results of the study were analyzed via SPSS software. The researcher concluded that teachers in private schools practice student-centered teaching approaches. They arrange group work and pair work activities. The dealing of the teachers with students was friendly, and they showed good attitudes toward students. In contrast, English teachers use traditional teaching methods in government schools,and there was no innovation in their teaching style. A huge communication gap was found between the students and teachers in government schools. Teachers were concerned only with delivering a lecture and were completely careless about students' academic learning and progress. Similarly, after analyzing and interpreting the data, recommendations were suggested.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007453/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007453<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PalArch's Journal of Archaeology of Egypt / Egyptology</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pedagogical skills, english teaching techniques, public and private and schools., syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>246 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007453">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007453">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
