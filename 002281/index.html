We refer to DPs like her stupid ass generically as the ACC (ass Camouflage Construction). The terminology reflects the perspective of the paper, which is that the ACC is an instance of a universal grammatical phenomenon we call camouflage. The ACC is also attested in non-AAE dialects of American English (Beavers and Koontz-Garboden 2006). 
For certain syntactic properties, the possessor of the ACC behaves as if it were external to the larger DP (e.g., binding, control, selection). For other syntactic properties, the possessor of the ACC behaves as if it were internal to the larger DP (e.g., finite verb agreement, traditional constituent structure tests). To account for this dual behavior, we propose that the ACC possessor DP originates in a position external to the ACC, and moves into its possessor position. 
	We discuss the implications of our analysis for other areas of AAE syntax, including the resumptive-with construction, a previously undocumented grammatical phenomenon, and the use of self in various constructions, which we suggest are illuminated by the notion camouflage.
Lastly, we briefly consider arguable instances of camouflage cross-linguistically in languages such as Georgian, French, the Mayan languages K’ekchi, and Tzotzil, and Yoruba.  The goal is to bring out genuine similarities between the ACC and these other constructions, supporting our perspective on the ACC.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002281/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002281<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Language 84.1 (2008)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>aae, camouflage, possessors, self, binding, resumptive-with construction, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002281/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2008]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1775 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002281">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002281">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
