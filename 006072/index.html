I investigate the Niger-Congo language Wolof, where control exists with both cross-linguistically typical EC predicates and with typical PC predicates, but it is always only Exhaustive. Interestingly, two other characteristics of typical EC (but not PC) verbs—that they are also restructuring verbs, and that they are exclusively monotransitive (i.e. that they do not take nominal complements)—are also true of all control verbs in Wolof. This confirms a correlation between EC, restructuring, and monotransitivity argued for by Cinque (2004, 2006) and Grano (2012, 2015), which lead them to propose that EC verbs are functional heads in the inflectional layer, meaning that such constructions involve only one subject. I however argue that this bundle of properties cannot be a simple consequence of monoclausal syntax, as typical PC verbs, which Grano claims are lexical, also appear to be lexical verbs in Wolof, yet exhibit all other properties of EC verbs. I therefore propose that the raising analysis must be available in bi-clausal constructions as well. More generally, this argues that at least one type of control is derived via movement, and does not involve a PRO (Hornstein 1999 et seq.).<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006072/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006072<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>control, exhaustive control, infinitives, wolof, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>258 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006072">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006072">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
