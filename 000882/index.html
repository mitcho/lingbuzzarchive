This paper offers supporting evidence for this analysis: in that it is shown that the movement analysis of conditional clauses allows us to account for the fact that Main Clause Phenomena are excluded in conditional clauses because this follows from intervention effects. Moreover, on the specific implementation of the analysis proposed here, which adopts the cartographic approach along the lines of Cinque (1999) and Cinque and Rizzi (2008), the account also predicts that conditional clauses will be incompatible with the speaker oriented IP-internal modal expressions (in the sense of Cinque 1999). Again, when present such modal markers block the operator movement postulated to derive the conditional clause. Finally,  the specific implementation of the movement analysis proposed predicts that conditional clauses lack the low construal reading which is found in (some) temporal adverbial clauses (cf. Bhatt and Pancheva 2002, 2006), a fact which initially had been seen as evidence AGAINST a movement derivation (cf. Citko 2000). The paper thus reinterprets one of the potential objections against the movement account of conditional clauses into an argument in favour<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000882/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000882<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Linguistic Inquiry</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>conditionals, high modals, main clause phenomena, intervention, flemish irrealis auxiliary</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000882/v1.pdf">v1 [June 2009]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1185 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000882">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000882">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
