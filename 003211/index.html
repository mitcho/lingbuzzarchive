The classic approach to numerical interpretation, first articulated by Horn (1972), contends that the basic meaning of <em>three</em> in a sentence like <em>Three people attended</em> is 'at least three', and that the upper bound it implies arises by way of scalar implicature. More recent approaches argue that the basic meaning of <em>three</em> is 'exactly three', implemented either with a uniqueness condition on existential quantification (Geurts 2006), or with a cardinality operator that limits the size of the individuals being existentially quantified over (Breheny 2008), or with a maximality operator that imposes an upper bound (Kennedy 2015). The goal of this article is to defend a version of the classic account and to argue against the 'exactly' accounts. The case rests on two new sets of arguments. The first set concerns numerical noun phrases that combine with collective predicates, as in <em>Three people lifted the piano together</em>: the classic account makes just the right predictions, as already argued by Koenig (1991), while the 'exactly' accounts overgenerate. The second set pertains to new data involving generically interpreted numerical noun phrases, as in <em>Three people can fit in the car</em> and <em>Three people can lift the piano</em>, which involve quasi-universal quantification over triplets of individuals (Link 1987, 1991). I show that the classic account provides a simple, uniform analysis of the interpretation of numerals across both existential and generic contexts. The 'exactly' accounts are shown to also be able to handle generic cases (by mirroring the classic account), but Kennedy's account overgenerates. The conclusion, taking into account the entirety of the data discussed here, is that the classic, scalar implicature approach to numerals is more empirically adequate than all of the 'exactly'-based approaches.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003211/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003211<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td><span style="color:red;"><b>NB: This paper has been superseded by <a style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;" href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003400">lingbuzz/003400</a>.</b></span></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>numerals, plurality, distributivity, collectivity, genericity, scalar implicature, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>419 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003211">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003211">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
