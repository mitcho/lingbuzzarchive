All of the indigenous languages (IL) face the pressures of displacement and shift, both those of millions of speakers and those of small linguistic communities. For the latter, total replacement, driven by universal bilingualism among school-age speakers of the IL and a breakdown of social and geographic isolation, is likely in many cases in the near future. However, the same forces of social integration, including the end of widespread female illiteracy and IL-monolingualism, have the same effect on the major languages, such as Nahuatl, the Mayan and Quechuan languages, etc. Linguistic research can focus on factors such as aspects of child bilingualism, related to first and second language learning, to better understand the process of language shift. The preservation of the most representative corpus of the IL oral tradition, and in many cases a complete record of historical written documents, will prove to be of great scientific and cultural value. The work of documentation will also conserve for present and future generations an indispensable resource forming part of the intellectual and literary heritage of communities. At the same time, this resource can serve as learning material for both first and second language learners. Aboriginal Education World, 90: 58—63.
