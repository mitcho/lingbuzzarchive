are anaphorically linked to an attitude holder in a superordinate clause. Existing accounts capture this dependency by treating a logophoric pronoun as a simplex variable that is obligatorily bound from the edge of an embedded attitude clause. Culy (1994) and Bimpeh and Sode (2021), however, pointed out that logophoric pronouns in Ewe do not behave like obligatorily bound variables, allowing both sloppy (bound) as well as strict (non-bound) readings in focus contexts involving ‘only’ and ellipsis. We strengthen this line of criticism
by providing novel cross-linguistic data which indicates that logophoric pronouns in Ewe, Igbo and Yoruba support strict readings. We offer an alternative formal account to existing approaches which builds on Bimpeh et al. (2022) and can capture both strict and sloppy interpretations, including hitherto undescribed varieties of strict readings. The main novelty involves decomposition of logophoric pronouns into two syntactic components at LF—a variable and a semantic presuppositional feature LOG which can be ignored in ellipsis and focus sites, following similar ideas in the literature on pronominal features (Sauerland 2013). Thus, logophors are essentially no different from other pronouns, in terms of their syntactic and semantic make up.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007679/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007679<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>resubmitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>logophors, strict/sloppy readings, binding, presupposition, ewe, yoruba, igbo, focus, de se, attitude ascriptions, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>693 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007679">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007679">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
