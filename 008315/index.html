I argue for a question-based analysis in line with Jasinskaja and Zeevat (2008, 2009) and Toosarvandani (2014) but also with key differences from them: "whereas" requires there to be a question under discussion (QUD) whose subquestions are good questions that are then answered by the clauses combined by "whereas". This analysis is motivated by novel data that point to a strong correlation between the felicity of "whereas"-sentences and the felicity of its conjuncts as direct answers to the QUD. The finding of a dedicated lexical item "whereas" for semantic opposition suggests that semantic opposition is a distinct use of "but", supporting Toosarvandani (2014). "Whereas"- and "but"-coordination shows the linguistic and cognitive reality of the notions of good-questionhood and informativeness, which the felicity of these coordinated structures depends on. This paper also provides a new diagnostic of question-answerhood that relies not on question-answer pairs, but on "whereas"- and "but"-sentences, declarative sentences that are nevertheless closely related to question-answering.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008315/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008315<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>question under discussion, semantic opposition, informativeness, good question, partition theory of questions, whereas, but, coordination, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>192 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008315">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008315">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
