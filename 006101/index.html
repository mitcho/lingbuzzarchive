The reduced forms of such predicates can surface inside a nominal of another predication, e.g., Four thousand ships passed through the lock last year; Susi bought a second guitar, and An occasional sailor strolled by. This paper argues that these predicates are displaced from their base-positions so that an event kind-denoting expression in the verbal category can be merged as the subject in the event-kind predication. The proposed overt movement displaces the categorial features of an expression, leaving its semantic features in situ, an operation symmetrical to a covert movement, which displaces the semantic features without categorial features.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006101/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006101<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Accepted by Studia Linguistica</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>event kind, frequency, numeral, ordinal, categorial feature, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>334 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006101">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006101">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
