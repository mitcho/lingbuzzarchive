The hypothesis explored is that argument-verb agreement is directly related to selection of arguments (s-selection), i.e. s-selectional features are in fact -features ([PERSON, NUMBER(, GENDER)], and that morphological argument-verb agreement mirrors this relation. Call this Selection Through Uninterpretable Features Theory, or STUF-Theory. The idea is that if X has uninterpretable , it selects a Lexical Item carrying  from the Lexical Array with which it can agree. This means that the distinction between structural and inherent case partly disappears and Case-Theory moves closer to Æ-Theory. Still, STUF-Theory must permit some non-Æ-related case as well, namely when X carries u but the Lexical Array has no more Lexical Item that can be inserted. Then, X instead probes its domain for a goal (in accordance with Chomsky 2004). 

STUF-Theory entails that morphological argument-verb agreement cannot be an Agree-relation holding between T and some DP (since T does not s-select), but must rather be an Agree-relation between Ë and some DP. For the same reason, it should be V that assigns accusative case to some DP. The benefit with such an analysis is that agreement would no longer be seen as an imperfection in the Faculty of Language, but should rather be regarded as a vital component in the building of syntactic structures.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000283/current.doc">doc</a> ][ <a href="/lingbuzz/000283/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000283<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000283">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000283</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Working Papers in Scandinavian Syntax 77</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>agreement, case, head-spec relation, selection, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>256 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000283">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000283">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
