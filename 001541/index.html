the Dravidian language Tamil which surfaces as 1 SG agreement marking in a clause embedded under a speech predicate. I show that this agreement is an instance of indexical shift and label it “monstrous agreement”. However, I demonstrate that its full range of empirical properties cannot be adequately explained by the major analyses of indexical shift in the literature. The bulk of these, I argue, in addition to being predominantly semantic in spirit, and thus ill-equipped to deal with a morphosyntactic phenomenon like agreement, also involve two core misconceptions regarding indexicality vs. logophoricity on the one hand and speech vs. attitude predicates on the other. I propose that these core assumptions be strongly re-evaluated from first principles and that syntactic and typological clues on the subject be paid more heed. I propose a new analysis of the Tamil paradigms which derives indexical shift within an enriched grammatical model involving contextual features
instantiated in a structurally articulated functional sequence of the clausal left periphery.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001541/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001541<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of SALT 21</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>monsters, indexicals, anaphors, anaphor  agreement effect, tamil, contextual and φ -features, agree(ment), selection, cartography, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>268 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001541">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001541">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
