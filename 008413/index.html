There is, however, a previously unstudied use---the argument-building use---which occurs without such an antecedent. This paper proposes an analysis of "too" that accounts for the argument-building use and unifies it with the canonical additive use. The central claim is that "too" is felicitous if and only if its antecedent can be taken to answer a relevant question such that the conjunction of "too"s antecedent and prejacent evidences some answer to that question more strongly than the antecedent does alone. This analysis relies on the notion of a "resolution" from Inquisitive Semantics and the treatment of context update as Bayesian inference, as is done in the Rational Speech Act framework. The treatment of "too" developed here provides the basis for a new approach to additivity that can be extended to other additive expressions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008413/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008413<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Accepted pending revisions at Semantics & Pragmatics</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>additives, question under discussion, discourse particles, inquisitive semantics, rational speech act, anaphora, pragmatics, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>196 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008413">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008413">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
