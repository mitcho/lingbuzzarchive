of words are often explained as arising
from the “underlying forms” of their morphemes.
These forms are latent strings that
linguists try to reconstruct by hand. We
propose to reconstruct them automatically
at scale, enabling generalization to new
words. Given some surface word types
of a concatenative language along with the
abstract morpheme sequences that they express,
we show how to recover consistent
underlying forms for these morphemes,
together with the (stochastic) phonology
that maps each concatenation of underlying
forms to a surface form. Our technique
involves loopy belief propagation in a natural
directed graphical model whose variables
are unknown strings and whose conditional
distributions are encoded as finitestate
machines with trainable weights. We
define training and evaluation paradigms
for the task of surface word prediction, and
report results on subsets of 7 languages<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003367/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003367<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>TACL</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>computational phonology, morphology, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>273 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003367">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003367">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
