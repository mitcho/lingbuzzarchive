We analyze English gerunds, showing that they are not reduced structures. Poss-ings display a non-trivial noun/sentence cross pattern that does not support non-self-embedding analyses. Akin to sentences,
poss-ings have accusative-marked objects, they license adverbial modifiers, and they permit sentential negation and aspect. However, their genitive-marked subjects, their behavior in clefts, and their compatibility with sub-aux inversion and extraposition resemble that of nominals. Like DPs, they
disallow fronted wh-phrases, yet, similar to clauses, a copy of a wh-phrase in their outer specifier is available for interpretation at LF. We develop and explore a new mechanism - category hybridization-
to explain this mixed pattern, suggesting that grammar can assemble new functional categories by selecting the intersection of sets of formal features from different categories previously stored in the
lexicon. Application of this mechanism results in impoverished, defective categories, because just a subset of the features of each preexisting category is selected. We extend this proposal to acc-ing
gerunds, arguing that poss-ings and acc-ings are both headed by a C∩D category, a hybrid formed by features in the intersection between complementizers and determiners. Our conclusion is, thus, that the
existence of sentential nominalization does not argue against the claim that self-embedding is available as a universal property of human language; rather, sentence nominalization manifests a grammatical operation of category-formation.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007119/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007119<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>entential nominalization, english gerunds, complementizers and determiners, functional category hybridization, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>462 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007119">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007119">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
