that a unified concept of phases in the syntax and morphology is possible. In Aghem, nominal prefixes drop with all agreeing modifiers, except numerals and quantifiers. I argue that this is due to a constraint that requires deletion of inherent features within a phase that contains inherent and non-inherent features of the same type. I first demonstrate that an approach that treats the absence/presence of noun prefixes as somewhat related to the status of the full DP as being in focus (hence in the syntactic position where focus is marked in Aghem) (Hyman, 2010; Kießling, 2010) is untenable on empirical grounds. I show that modifiers that disallow nominal prefix drop are DP-external. I rely on this to propose that the asymmetry is tied to the simultaneous presence of inherent and non-inherent features of the same type within a single phase domain (DP, being a phase). This forces impoverishment of inherent features, hence the absence of class prefixes on nouns. Numerals and quantifiers are DP-external and, as such, do not interact with inherent features for the purpose of the impoverishment requirement. D, therefore, counts as a phase head for syntactic as well as morphological operations.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007672/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007672<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>aghem, agree, impoverishment, phases, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/007672/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2023]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>215 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007672">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007672">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
