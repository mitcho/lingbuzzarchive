In this paper, I propose that these are weighted, violable constraints (building on e.g. Murphy 2018, Georgi 2019). I provide a unified account of cross-clausal long-distance agreement, phi-feature hierarchy effects in multiargument agreement systems, dative intervention, and PCC effects.

The case study of Maithili in Section 3 suggests that partial blocking effects attested in multiargument agreement systems which have previously been analyzed within in a dynamic interaction (Deal 2021, Alam and Kumaran 2022) framework are better suited to a Constraint-driven Agree analysis. In Section 4, I argue that cross-clausal long-distance agreement, which has standardly been analyzed as fed by covert movement of the agreement controller to the edge of the embedded-clause phase (e.g. Polinsky and Potsdam 2001), can instead be analyzed as a partial blocking pattern within a Constraint-driven Agree model, drawing primarily on data from Hinuq. In Section 5, I show that two well-attested blocking patterns involving datives -- inaccessibility of datives for agreement and defective intervention -- can surface as <em>partial</em> blocking patterns in some languages (in particular Alutor, Itelmen, and Sanzhi Dargwa), as predicted by the Constraint-driven Agree model. This is consistent with past work (Murphy 2018) arguing on independent grounds that dative intervention patterns in Icelandic result from weighted constraint competition. Finally, I propose in Section 6 that the model can also account for Person Case Constraint effects, by deriving derivational crashes from a grammaticality threshold for harmony scores.
