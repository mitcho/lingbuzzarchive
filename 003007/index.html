At the same time, certain languages have been argued to disallow long-distance wh-in-situ. This paper argues that even in  languages that show apparent clause-boundedness effects, wh-in-situ, like wh-movement, can in principle cross an arbitrary number of clauses. Failure to license a wh-phrase across a clause boundary, when it occurs, can be shown to result from the interaction between wh-agreement and independent operations affecting embedded clauses. Evidence will be drawn primarily from Malayalam (Dravidian), which has been argued to disallow long-distance wh-in-situ with finite embedded clauses. I will show that the relevant factor for wh-licensing is not finiteness, but A'-movement of embedded clauses, an operation that is common with finite CPs. The core of the problem lies in the fact that interrogative C is a generalized [A']-probe that can interact with a number of featurally more specific goals, including the [A']-features on the head of the moving clause. It will be shown that this approach can account for a number of  facts about Malayalam wh-question formation, including selective transparency of certain finite clauses for long-distance wh-licensing.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003007/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003007<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in NLLT</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>wh-in-situ, malayalam, clause-boundedness, long-distance question-formation, relativized probes, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003007/v1.pdf">v1 [May 2016]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1389 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003007">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003007">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
