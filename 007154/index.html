Like many Spanish varieties, Sevillian debuccalizes coda /s/ to [h] (/sC/ --> [hC]). Unlike other varieties, Sevillian is undergoing a change whereby [hC] sequences are variably realized as [Ch] sequences. I argue that surface (phonetic) [Ch] sequences are metathesized versions of underlying /sC/ clusters, and have not phonologized into a new series of aspirated stops /p^h, t^h, k^h/. Evidence supporting the /sC/ cluster analysis comes from a perception study in which Sevillians reconstruct /s/ on the word preceding [Ch] sequences. Listeners of other dialects do not attribute [h] in [Ch] sequences to a preceding /s/. I present a brief cross-dialectal analysis corresponding to the participant groupsâ€™ different behavior in the perception experiment, in which the dialects share underlying representations but map them differently to surface forms. I also discuss reasons the aspirated stop analysis may be implausible, from both a learning and analytical perspective. The findings have broader implications for our understanding of the mapping between underlying and surface forms, segments, and the connection between dialect variation and perception.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007154/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007154<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>NLLT (accepted version) (published version: https://rdcu.be/dnQKu)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonetics, experimental, metathesis, perception, underlying representations, phonology, spanish</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>522 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007154">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007154">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
