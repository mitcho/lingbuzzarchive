One direct consequence is that if both A- and A′-features trigger a movement operation in unison, it should show mixed A/A′-behavior. This prediction is borne out in Dinka, where C hosts both φ- and A′-features and triggers movement with both A- and A′-properties.
In this article, I extend this result to English. First, I show that the distribution of φ and A′ features in English is such that v, but not English C, is a potential composite movement trigger. This limited possibility for composite movement, I then argue, suggests a novel solution to the longstanding puzzle of English tough-movement (TM). TM famously shows mixed A/A′-behavior that has long posed a challenge in the context of the traditional A/A′-dichotomy – it is long-distance and can cross over c-commanding DPs, yet it targets a case position and triggers φ-Agreement – and moreover behaves as if Spec(CP) is an inaccessible landing site – it is fully acceptable across control infinitives, which lack a phasal CP (Wurmbrand 2014), but degraded past finite CPs, which do not. Treating TM as a successive cyclic composite movement operation from Spec(vP)-to-Spec(vP) solves these and several other novel and well-known puzzles of TM.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003604/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003604<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>tough movement, a/a'-distinction, composite movement, dinka, reconstruction, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003604/v1.pdf">v1 [August 2017]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>637 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003604">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003604">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
