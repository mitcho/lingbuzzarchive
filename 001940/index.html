AP&L contend (and I completely agree) that a learning strategy proposal involving innate knowledge needs to show “precisely how a particular type of innate knowledge would help children acquire X”. More importantly, I believe this should be a metric that any component of a learning strategy is measured by. For any component (whether innate or derived, whether language-specific or domain-general), we need to not only propose that this component could help children learn some piece of linguistic knowledge but also demonstrate at least “one way that a child could do so”. To this end, I first highlight how computational modeling is well suited for doing precisely this, and I believe we should test all potential learning strategies, including the ones AP&L themselves propose as alternatives to the UG-based ones they find lacking. An additional and highly useful benefit of the computational modeling methodology is that it forces us to recognize hidden assumptions within our proposed learning strategies, a problem that AP&L rightly recognize with many existing proposals.

This leads me to suggest certain criteria that any learning strategy should satisfy, relating to its utility in principle and practice, as well as its usability by children. Once we have a promising learning strategy that satisfies these criteria, we can then concern ourselves with the components comprising that strategy. With respect to this, I briefly discuss the type of components AP&L find unhelpful, and note that several of the components they would prefer might still be reasonably classified as UG components. In addition, AP&L ask for explicit examples of UG components that actually do work. I provide a brief review of one potentially UG component that’s part of a successful learning strategy for syntactic islands (described in Pearl & Sprouse 2013) which also satisfies the criteria I suggest for evaluating learning strategies more generally.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001940/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001940<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Language (Perspectives) -- to appear</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>universal grammar, language acquisition, learning strategies, computational modeling, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/001940/v1.pdf">v1 [October 2013]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1695 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001940">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001940">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
