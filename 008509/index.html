In this paper, I consider the properties of NVI applicatives across Spanish, Austronesian languages, and Bantu languages, with particular emphasis placed on Bantu. I show that not only do NVIs occur in all language families, but their presence has a predictable function in modifying event structure. I apply to term `aspectual applicatives' to describe NVI applicatives that either delimit/ contain an event or intensify it in some way. 

Following Wood & Marantz (2017) and Harley (2013) in positing no meaningful difference between Appl and v beyond the position they are merged. I argue that aspectual applicatives are derived from the verb root being merged at the lowest position in the extended verbal projection, embedded within the phrase headed by applicative morphology which introduces an event (Acedo–Matellán and Mateu, 2014). Aspectual applicatives thus suggest that the function of v and Appl is not to introduce arguments, but introduce events and provide a licensing position for additional arguments. The range of aspectual properties associated aspectual applicatives is then predicted by the position where the root is merged.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008509/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008509<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>applicatives, argument structure, endpoint, figure, ground, central coincidence, terminal coincidence, argument licensing, event structure, event, root, verbal projection, verbal domain, aspect, iterative, pluractional, delimiting, telicity, quantity, theta-criterion, theta-role, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>42 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008509">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008509">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
