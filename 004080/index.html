Recent work in subregular phonology (Graf 2017) predicts that every constraint is either exclusively local or exclusively non-local, but never a mixture of the two. I show that this prediction is not borne out as at least four previously described phenomena combine local and non-local information: Korean vowel harmony, the non-final RHOL stress pattern, non-local blocking of local dissimilation in Samala, and non-locally conditioned local tone spreading in Copperbelt Bemba.
However, the formal model of Graf (2017) requires only a minor generalization of its notion of locality in order to account for these cases while still excluding unattested phenomena like first-last harmony. The difference between the two lies in how local and non-local information is interwoven, with the attested patterns following a very limited template that is reminiscent of c-command in syntax. Based on these findings I conjecture that wherever local and non-local factors interact in phonology, they do so in a c-command-like fashion. This paper thus provides independent evidence for the hypothesis that phonology and syntax may be more closely related on a computational level than is commonly believed.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004080/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004080<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Proceedings of NELS 2017</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>computational linguistics, subregular complexity, locality, typology, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>368 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004080">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004080">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
