instantiations of the Merge over Move (MOM) cost-of-operation distinction. It is

concluded that while the mechanisms introduced there exhibit independently interesting

features, they subtract substantially from the interest of the MOM economy of derivation

explanations. The removal of an assumption will then be considered that makes the core

cases involving there-constructions a problem to begin with: that non-finite T must host a

specifier position (checking an EPP/D-feature). Denying the existence of such features

removes the problem that the MOM distinction was introduced to solve, allowing the

core cases of associate-movement vs. expletive-insertion to arise as a case of true

optionality. Consequences for other phenomena are examined and the proposal is found

to be consistent with much recent research investigating these phenomena.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000127/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000127<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>University of Maryland Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (63-103, 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>epp, merge, move, minimalism, expletives, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1530 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000127">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000127">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
