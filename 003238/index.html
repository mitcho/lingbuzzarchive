By contrast, when attached to an argument, "nanak" has a much restricted distribution, and its reading is distinctively reflexive. Interestingly, there is also a grey area in-between the two construals, where "nanak" occupies an adjunct position, though interpreted with a variety of reflexive readings. Our inquiry is thus two-fold: The first part is to deal with the issue whether there is a conceptual connection between only and self, especially in view of a strong resemblance from Chinese "ziji" ‘self’, which behaves much like an intensifier before negation, while serving as a reflexive adverbial after negation. The second part is to find an interpretive procedure which aims to capture the generalization behind various construals of "nanak" and "ziji". In this paper, we propose to build upon Horn’s (1969) classic analysis of "only", and characterize reflexive adverbials as focus operators involving negation over an alternative set. Depending on the locus of the self-operator, it may be related to either a predicate or a peripheral argument role (cause, instrument, comitant, etc). This explains away the spectrum of ‘selfhood’ readings across Squliq Atayal and Mandarin Chinese, which in turn leads to a deeper understanding of how contrastivity interacts with reflexivity in natural languages.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003238/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003238<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Perspectives on the Architecture and Acquisition of Syntax: Essays in Honour of R.
