The descriptions of Hebrew in the literature comprise of all Hebrew layers. Those which claim to deal with Modern Hebrew suggest that the Hebrew verb system is a tense-based system, which consists of seven verb patterns. 

The current study was performed on a mini-corpus of Spoken Israeli Hebrew, which consisted of recorded spontaneous conversations of fifteen Israeli Hebrew speakers in different occasions. The results show some outstanding findings regarding the means, which Israeli speakers use to express tense, mood and aspect (TMA) in Hebrew, and suggest that Modern Hebrew is an aspect-based system rather than a tense-based one, which consists of only five verb patterns.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000903/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000903<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>LiA (Linguistics_in_Amsterdam), vol 2, 2009</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>tma, tense, mood, aspect, israeli hebrew, morphology, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000903/v2.pdf">v2 [April 2009]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/000903/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2009]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>681 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000903">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000903">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
