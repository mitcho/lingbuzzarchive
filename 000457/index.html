As clefting, by all accounts, seems to be one of the typologically defining properties of at least two major language families of south Asia, i.e., Tibeto-Burman and Dravidian, it is important to investigate the rationale behind adopting a cleft strategy for question forming in these languages. 



Specifically our analysis for Meiteilon takes cleft-formation as similar to predicate inversion; the NP to be focussed has a cliticised form of the verb be attached to it resulting into a focus interpretation for that NP. The focussed NP is considered to have moved out of the CP inside the DP to a preverbal position -- the typical position for focus in south Asian languages. 



The question that we pose for Meiteilon is: Why is the element which attracts phonological focus (i.e., the Wh word) is marked again for focusing syntactically by clefting? This leads to the rather dramatic discovery which is the heart of this paper. The fact that there are these two ways of representing informational structural focus, namely, phonological and syntactic, leads us to think that Meiteilon (and perhaps Tibeto-Burman languages in general) does not actually mark focus twice but as is normal, only once. In fact, it further leads to the astonishing conclusion that Meiteilon really does not mark focus and emphasis in general phonologically at all. And since questions demand focus semantics, the language system develops and/ or adopts marking focus and emphasis in general through syntax.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000457/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000457<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000457">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000457</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Austin; Delhi</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>cleft, meiteilon, meitei, focus, malayalam, prosody, interface, centering, pseudocleft, pitch, monoclausal, biclausal, akmajian, meinunger, syntax, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>308 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000457">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000457">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
