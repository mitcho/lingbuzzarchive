The core proposal is that ‘her own’ is a reflexive possessive complex pronoun that is functionally equivalent to the unlexicalized form ‘herself’s’. The supporting arguments are as follows. First, empirically, the purported “lexical reflexive” use of ‘her’ leaves unexplained the syntactic and morphological peculiarity of ‘her’ and the form-meaning mismatch triggered by the morphological poverty of it as a reflexive indexical. Second, theoretically, the morphological compactness of English pronouns and their syntactic functions blur head-phrase distinction. Third, theoretically again, pronouns are syntactically distributed on multiple nodes in their derivation but morphologically clustered as words, with phi-features, the reflexive feature and the possessive feature entering into the derivation separately but united later on before vocabulary insertion.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007975/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007975<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>pronoun, anaphor, reflexive, possessive, syntax, morphology, distributed morphology, english, chinese, japanese, mongolian, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>209 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007975">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007975">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
