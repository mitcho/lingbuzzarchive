Many experiments carried out in the area of psycho- and neuro-linguistics empirically confirmed this view and proved the psychological reality of the formal representations arriving at measuring some neural correlates of the syntactic processes. The experimental paradigms in this field have so far been based on two possible strategies: either measuring the spontaneous production of correct sentences or the reaction to systematic errors. We would like to give an original contribute to it by adopting a new methodology: we asked the subjects to destroy the order of different kinds of well-formed clause structures and noun phrases by altering the word order. No constrain on the execution of this task nor any example or other hint was provided to the subjects. Indeed, their answers were highly systematic: rather than re-combining the elements of the stimuli in a pure random way, they unconsciously took account of the underlying phrase structure showing a persistence of phrase structure. The irrelevance of semantics was also tested by employing pseudo-words along with fully lexical element. We suggest that our research might contribute to the comprehension of the neural processes that underlie the syntactic elaboration along new lines.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001417/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001417<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Poster presented at MIT 50 (ling. dept. anniversary)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phrase structure, linearity, hierarchy, psychological reality, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>240 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001417">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001417">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
