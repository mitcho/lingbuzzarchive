Parrott</a><br/>April 2009</center>&nbsp;<p></p>This article is intended as a contribution toward an emerging program (Adger & Smith 2005, Adger 2006, 2007) that seeks to account for intra-individual (or, Labovian sociolinguistic) variation (e.g., Chambers, Trudgill & Schilling-Estes 2002) within a broadly Minimalist theoretical framework  (Chomsky 1995 et seq., and related work). Following a specific approach (Parrott 2007, Nevins & Parrott In press, Parrott To appear), I attempt to implement this objective by utilizing the theory of Distributed Morphology (DM, Halle & Marantz 1993, Embick & Noyer 2007). Expletive constructions and their verbal agreement properties are a potentially productive point of contact between variationist sociolinguistics and morphosyntactic theory. Expletives and agreement, both in English and cross-linguistically, have long been important and central topics for generative syntax. Moreover, sociolinguists using variationist methods have documented abundant inter- and intra-individual variation in the forms of expletives and their corresponding agreement patterns for diverse varieties of English. This growing body of empirical data is evidently relevant for evaluating morphosyntactic-theoretical analyses of expletive constructions, as well as for developing a Minimalist theory of variation and change. With these larger issues in the background, the article takes a more narrow focus, concentrating on intra-individually variable there-expletive it (TEIT) (Parrott 2002) in a moribund English variety spoken on Smith Island, Maryland, U.S.A. (e.g., Schilling-Estes & Wolfram 1999).  After showing that TEIT with categorical 3rd singular (3sg) associate agreement is problematic for two particular Minimalist approaches (Cardinaletti 1997, Chomsky 2000), I follow a somewhat radical DM approach that denies the existence of uninterpretable Case or Agreement (or, phi = &#966;) features in the narrow syntax (McFadden 2004, Bobaljik 2008). I suggest that mechanisms of intra- and inter-individual variation are located in the semantically interpretable features of the expletive morphemes themselves and their interaction with language-specific, and sometimes variable, morphological &#966;-feature copying rules. These post-syntactic agreement operations are responsible for categorical 3sg agreement with TEIT, as well as for (variable) rightward associate agreement with expletive there. Thus, the proposed DM analysis captures not only the facts of TEIT on Smith Island, but accounts for a range of variation patterns attested in varieties of English.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000858/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000858<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000858">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000858</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Linguistic Analysis</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>intra- and inter-individual variation, morphosyntax, morphology, syntax, sociolinguistics, distributed morphology, minimalism, pf, expletives, agreement, case, &amp;#966; features, english varieties, smith island</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/000858/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2009]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>304 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000858">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000858">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
