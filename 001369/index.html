***************
This paper proposes a new kind of morphosyntactic entity, LIMINAL CATEGORIES (LCs), which shares properties of words and phrases simultaneously. It proposes an analysis of three kinds of LCs in the Amazonian language, Wari', (i) periphrastic pronouns; (ii) complex kinship terms; and (iii) and INTENTIONAL STATE CONSTRUCTIONS (ISCs). I propose an account of LCs in Role and Reference Grammar (RRG) and conlude that LCs are not abnormalities, but fundamental components of the syntax of human languages. I argue that though some current theories can account for Wari' complex kinship terms and periphrastic pronouns, RRG is better equipped to analyze the predicates of ISCs, as part of its general account of LCs.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001369/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001369<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Never published</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>intentional state constructions, periphrastic pronouns, wari', syntax, phonology, semantics, morphology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>447 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001369">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001369">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
