phenomena are studied in isolation, and in part because the relationship between
language and intelligence is not taken into account. This article calls
to shift focus from "solving tasks" to "differentiation", which we believe is
the fundamental ability behind intelligence. Comparable properties facilitate
differentiation. We introduce a multi-dimensional search as a computational
paradigm of cognition. It enables a new view on specialization and generalization.
We propose to view language as a reflection of how intelligence models
the world. It makes differentiation a fundamental approach in our theory of
language. We depart from traditional views on reference and meaning and
propose to view them with differentiation in mind. We introduce referential
flexibility of symbols and coherence constraints, which help us to explain
how polysemy and context work in tandem for resolving meaning. These
contributions will stimulate research in computational linguistics.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007345/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007345<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>reference, meaning, compositionality, generalization, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>768 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007345">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007345">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
