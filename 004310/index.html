This article was published 1990 in Modern Icelandic Syntax, Syntax and Semantics 24, ed. by Joan Maling and Annie Zaenen, 41–69. San Diego, Academic Press. Some minor editing revisions (but no content changes) have been made. The article was largely based on a thesis written in Icelandic in 1983 (Um frásagnarumröðun og grundvallarorðaröð í forníslensku ‘On Narrative Inversion and Basic Word Order in Old Icelandic’), published 1994 by Institute of Linguistics, Reykjavik (179 pages). Due to the Icelandic parsed historical corpus (IcePaHC), there is a recent upsurge of interest in Icelandic historical syntax, so I decided to put some work into making this old article electronically accessible.
	Electronic corpora are rapidly changing the landscape of linguistics. Often, of course, for the better, but there are also some pitfalls on the new highways. Inevitably, and understandably, IcePaHC contains some errors; for example, it tags some instances of topic drop and of nonrefererential pro as referential pro (see Sigurðsson 2018, n. 5; ‘Topicality in Icelandic: Null arguments and Narrative Inversion’, accessible on Lingbuzz). V1 declaratives are another tricky area; as I show in this article, subtypes of such declaratives must be distinguished, largely depending on subject topicality, and it is not easy to detect this without careful reading of the texts. Another important issue is that V1 declaratives are genre related in both Old and Modern Icelandic; when comparing the frequency and use of such declaratives in different historical periods, it is crucial that one compare comparable texts. Nothing replaces them.
