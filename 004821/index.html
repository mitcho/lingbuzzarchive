We present a new Grammatical theory of Scalar Implicatures according to which "exh" is replaced with "pex", an operator that contributes its prejacent as asserted content, but the negation of scalar alternatives at a *non-at-issue* level of meaning. We show that by treating this non-at-issue level as a *presupposition*, this theory resolves a number of empirical challenges faced by the old formulation of "exh" (as well as by standard neo-Gricean theories). The empirical challenges include projection of scalar implicatures from certain embedded environments (‘some under some’ sentences), their restricted distribution under negation, and the existence of common ground-mismatching and oddness-inducing implicatures. We argue that these puzzles have a uniform solution given a "pex"-based theory of implicatures and independently motivated principles concerning presupposition projection and the conditions and constraints under which they may be locally and globally accommodated.
