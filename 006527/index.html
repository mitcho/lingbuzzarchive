I argue that this view is correct, by showing that one of its largely-unexplored predictions has real empirical payout. The prediction is that the dependency-forming properties of functional heads, being morphological in nature, are mutable, and may be conditioned by nearby roots and functional structure. I focus here on Voice heads, and my starting assumption is that in Choctaw, by default, Voice[+N] (the Voice head which introduces a specifier) agrees with its specifier (the external argument) and Voice[–N] (i.e. specifierless Voice, found in unaccusatives) does not agree with anything. However, I propose that in some environments, Voice[–N] does launch a phi-probe, and it results in Voice[–N] agreeing with the internal argument. I refer to these configurations as 'low ergatives'. A small survey of previous work on case and agreement dependencies suggests (1) that the case-assignment properties of functional heads are mutable in the same way, and (2) that the reverse is
attested—in some environments Voice[+N] fails to launch a phi-probe. This is consistent with a purely-morphological model of agreement and case-assignment: just as the exponence and interpretation of functional heads can be conditioned by adjacent roots and functional material, so too can the dependency-forming properties of those heads be conditioned in the same way.
