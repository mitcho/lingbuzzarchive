We claim that RTs are in principle compatible with all types of embedded clauses regardless of whether the selecting predicate is factive/non-assertive or non-factive/assertive. Languages vary greatly on how freely they allow RTs in various types of complements. Adapting an intervention account of RTs in which an operator moving to Spec,CP intervenes with other types of operations, we claim that two A’-movements compete for the same syntactic position in certain types of clauses. We account for the variation in the distribution of RTs across languages by the options made possible by feature inheritance of discourse features. In Japanese and Spanish, the topic feature may be inherited by T from C, so that some instances of topic fronting are to Spec,TP. This movement does not compete with the operator that has moved to Spec,CP, so no competition arises. In contrast, the topic feature stays in C in English, so that topic fronting (and other RTs) and the operator movement to CP vie for the same position. This then triggers a competition effect in many constructions such as factives where operator movement has occurred.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001752/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001752<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>topicalization, competition, factivity, feature inheritance, root transformations, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1315 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001752">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001752">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
