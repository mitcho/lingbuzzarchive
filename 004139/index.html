Meyer-Lübke 1900:426ff). However, although Romance prepositional infinitives are widely attested across time and space, their Latin (or proto-Romance) origins are as yet unknown, since prepositional infinitives do not exist in Latin, apart from some very late and dubious examples which cannot be taken for granted (Diez 1876:201-202, Beardsley 1921:97). Nonetheless, there have been recent attempts to reconstruct proto-Romance prepositional infinitives, which are structurally equivalent to Latin prepositional gerunds/gerundives as suppletive markers of the oblique functions of the infinitive and the latter may be taken as precursors of the former (Schulte 2007:87ff). <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004139/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004139<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>The Philological Society Blog (https://blog.philsoc.org.uk/2018/04/25/prepositional-infinitives-in-latin-romance/) </td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>latin, romance, philology, preposition, infinitive, gerund, gerundive, complementation, clausal complementation, prepositional infinitive, non-finite complementation, prepositional complementiser, syntax, keith tse</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>32 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004139">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004139">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
