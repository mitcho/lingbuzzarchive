There is as much evidence for a level of representation somewhere between morphemes and phrases in Chinese as there is in English. Yet as with English, the evidence reveals Chinese words as dynamic, sometimes more like lexicalized wholes and sometimes more like decomposable complexes. Moreover, while semantics, phonology, syntax, and psycholinguistics all point roughly at a word level in Chinese (and English), they do not point in exactly the same direction. After reviewing well-known problems with wordhood in English, linguistic and psycholinguistic evidence for the word level in Chinese, and signs that Chinese words are as variable in nature as they are in English, I show how naive discriminative learning may help express the dynamism of wordhood.

[This draft was finished in September, 2017, and so it still cites papers as "forthcoming" that have since come forth, fails to mention Xu, 2018, The word status of Chinese adjective-noun combinations, Linguistics, 56(1), 207-256, and doesn't refer to a Chinese NDL project by another research group that doesn't seem to have left any internet traces.]
