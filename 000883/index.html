It is typically invoked in form of the Subset Principle to resolve competitions between the markers of a language which arise due to lexical underspecification of inflectional markers. The Subset Principle has the effect that whenever a more specific marker competes for a syntactic context with a less specific marker, then it is always the more specific marker that is inserted. 



It seems to be a recurring pattern in syntactic derivations, too, that structure-building operations are ordered in such a way that elements that are more `specific' in one sense or another are are preferred by the probing element over less specific elements. This pattern emerges in a number of seemingly unrelated environments, such as long-distance agreement and Mahajan's Generalisation, which were previously accounted for by independent principles.



The goal of this paper is to propose a new approach to syntactic structure-building that accounts for these data in a uniform way. The underlying hypothesis is that specificity is a much more powerful underlying syntactic principle than was previously thought. I propose that syntactic derivations are driven by a specificity principle on merge: when more than one constituent is a candidate for an agreement relationship or displacement operation, the operation will involve the more specific constituent. This specificity principle yields most effects of the Minimal Link Condition (MLC), apart from the superiority case, which is shown to be an phase effect. In addition, specificity also accounts for a number of Anti-MLC effects, such as oder-preserving movement and anti-superiority effects, which were previously accounted for by independent, partially overlapping principles. The MLC and related locality conditions (Equidistance, A-over-A-Condition) can therefore be dispensed with in such a system.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000883/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/000883<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Manuscript, University of Konstanz</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>specificity, subset principle, emergence of the unmarked, specificity condition, elsewhere principle, proper inclusion principle, blocking, panini's principle; minimal link condition, a-over-a, equidistance, superiority, order-preserving movement, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>466 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/000883">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/000883">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
