In recent years, especially after the publication of Cinque (2005), the typology of Universal 20 has become a popular research topic. This paper builds on the typological work that has already been done, and shows that the word order patterns can be explained diachronically. I use the word order principles from Dryer (2018) as a starting point, since these have already been shown to account for the relative frequencies of noun phrase word orders. However, I suggest that these principles, rather than simply being stipulated, are the natural outcome of language change. By making reference to findings from the literature on working memory, syntactic processing, and syntactic priming, I show that language change will tend to produce languages which obey Dryer's principles more often than they produce languages which disobey them. In summary, then, the typology of Universal 20 is constrained by diachrony, and diachrony is constrained by processing factors. This view allows for a purely diachronic explanation of Universal 20, which hopefully serves as a useful case study for future work on Evolutionary Syntax.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004675/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004675<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Qualifying Paper, Yale University</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>universal 20, typology, noun phrase, diachronic explanation, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>174 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004675">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004675">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
