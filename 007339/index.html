It introduces a distinction between performative and informative updates, where informative updates filter out indices of context sets (cf. Stalnaker 1978), whereas performative updates change their indices (cf. Szabolcsi 1982). The notion of index change is investigated in detail, identifying implementations by a function or by a relation. Declarations like "the meeting is (hereby) adjourned" are purely performative updates that just enforce an index change on a context set. Assertions like "the meeting is (already) adjourned" are analyzed as combinations of a performative update that introduces a guarantee of the speaker for the truth of the proposition, and an informative update that restricts the context set so that this proposition is true. The first update is the illocutionary act characteristic for assertions; the second is the primary perlocutionary act, and is up for negotiations with the addressee. Several other speech acts will be discussed, in particular commissives, directives, exclamatives, optatives, and definitions, which are all performative, and differ from related assertions. The paper concludes a discussion of locutionary acts, which are modeled as index changers as well, and proposes a novel analysis for the performative marker hereby.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007339/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007339<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>speech acts, performatives, assertions, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>579 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007339">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007339">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
