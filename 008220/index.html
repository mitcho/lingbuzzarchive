That said, informing and socialization by linguistic engagements (languaging) via participation in dialogues is a universal of language, regrettably neglected in current linguistic thought.  In the current article I argue that the dialogue and its discernible internal structure is the best representation of natural language in its primary role as advertising one's private thoughts by socialization. Moreover, languaging by dialogues comes naturally in humans of all ages, cultures, genders, ethnicities, suggesting innate predispositions. Consequently, knowledge of language must include ability for participation in dialogues and must be recognized as an essential  component of the language faculty, a topic  highly relevant for the study of the evolution of language. In this sense the evolution of language is better defined as evolution of capacities for languaging by dialogue.  <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008220/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/008220<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>language system, languaging, dialogue, language evolution, multimodality, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>169 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/008220">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/008220">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
