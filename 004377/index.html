I propose that in many cases how a given type of content projects is determined by how it composes in the syntax/semantics. I furthermore pursue a reductionist approach trying to minimize the inventory of composition/projection strategies available in natural language. In this paper I look at a range of seemingly diverse types of adnominal content, spoken and gestural, that have a potential or a requirement to project from under semantic operators: adnominal adjectives, adnominal appositives, co-nominal gestures, phi-features on pronouns, and height specifications on co-verbal gestures. I argue that only two composition strategies exist for this content, depending on where it merges, which also determines how it projects: the modifier strategy, exemplified by adjectives, and the supplement strategy, exemplified by appositives. I reduce the three remaining phenomena to one or the other. In particular, I argue that both strategies are available to gestures, as evidenced by novel experimental data that I adduce here, but when gestures are modifiers, they are preferably non-restricting. I, thus, synthesize the proposals in Ebert & Ebert 2014 and Schlenker 2018a, but also go beyond them by explicitly addressing the question of how gestures integrate into utterances compositionally and re-purposing Schlenker's cosuppositions as a modality neutral mechanism of generating projecting interpretations of non-restricting modifiers. I further argue that phi-features on pronouns are obligatorily non-restricting modifiers, contra the standard presuppositional analysis (Cooper 1983 et seq.). Similarly, height specifications on co-verbal gestures can be analyzed as modifiers of incorporated individual arguments and further assimilated to phi-features on pronouns (in line with Schlenker & Chemla 2018) or adjectives. The benefit of this reductionist approach is that we don't have to introduce gesture-specific composition/projection strategies into our grammar, nor do we have to stipulate that phi-features on pronouns or height specifications on co-verbal gestures trigger presuppositions or posit any non-standard composition strategies for them. Treating phi-features as modifiers is also more plausible morphosyntactically.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004377/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004377<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>manuscript</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>composition, projection, adjectives, appositives, co-speech gestures, phi-features, modifiers, supplements, cosuppositions, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>156 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004377">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004377">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
