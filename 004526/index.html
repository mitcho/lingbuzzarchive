This paper proposes a theoretical approach to obviation that is intended to capture not only its morphosyntactic properties but also the crucial role that discourse factors play in its patterning. The analysis combines two existing ideas: Richards’ (2010) proposal that proximate nominals are DP while obviatives are KP and Branigan and MacKenzie’s (1999) proposal that the reference of proximate nominals is controlled by an operator in CP. The main proposal is that the Algonquian clause includes an operator in CP that binds all DPs in its domain unless a KP layer intervenes. There are thus two kinds of third-person nominals in Algonquian: proximate nominals, as DPs, are obligatorily coreferent with the CP operator, while obviative nominals, as KPs, have independent reference. By connecting the DP-KP distinction to the CP level, we gain a unified account of the pragmatics and morphosyntax of obviation: the discourse-governed properties reflect the choice of referent for the topic operator in CP, the morphosyntactic properties follow from the DP-KP asymmetry, and the link between discourse and morphosyntax lies in the referential properties of the nominals: if a nominal is coreferent with the CP operator, it must have DP morphosyntax; if it is disjoint, it must have KP morphosyntax.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004526/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004526<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Proceedings of the 2017 annual conference of the Canadian Linguistic Association, ed. by Andrew Alexander Monti</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>obviation, coreference, nominal features, algonquian, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>446 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004526">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004526">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
