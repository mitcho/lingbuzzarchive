For these researchers, Voice, together with two flavors of applicative heads, enable a wide range of phrases to be promoted to the phase edge of VoiceP and check structural case with T, giving rise to a cross-linguistically rare four-way voice system (e.g. Maclachlan 1996; Aldridge 2004, 2012, 2017; see also Rackowski 2002 and Rackowski & Richards 2005 for a similar approach). In this view, Austronesian-type voice is essentially similar to the active/passive alternation, with Voice being the core semi-functional head behind both types of systems.

In this paper, we argue instead that Austronesian-type voice is fundamentally different from Kratzerian Voice. Support for this claim comes from new data from Puyuma, an understudied Western Austronesian language that displays both an Austronesian-type four-way voice distinction and a two-way voice contrast akin to the Indo-European-style active/passive alternation. We show that these two voice types can co-occur in a single language because each is hosted in a distinct functional projection (the latter within VoiceP; the former in the C domain). We argue accordingly what has been termed 'voice' in the literature does not form a homogeneous group.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005426/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005426<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>To appear in Proceedings of WCCFL38</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>puyuma, voice, philippine-type voice, austronesian-type voice, detransitive, mirror principle, agreement, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005426/v1.pdf">v1 [September 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>509 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005426">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005426">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
