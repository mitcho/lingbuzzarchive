On the surface, passive verbs in Armenian provide a counter-example to this assumption. At first glance, the surface exponents of passive verbs seem to depend on the root. In contrast, the morphophonology of the passive depends on the stem of active verbs, not the root. This complex dependency can be easily handled with Output-Output constraints over bound stems (Steriade 2016). Such an analysis is pseudo-cyclic. However, upon closer examination at the morphosemantic dependencies of passives and actives, I ultimately argue that the pseudo-cyclicity is only apparent. I explicitly argue that the stem of active verbs are cyclically contained within passive verbs. In order to explain why the theme vowel of the active stem is absent in the passive, I utilize affix truncation rules from Aronoff (1976), roughly equivalent to contemporary DMâ€™s readjustment rules (Trommer 2012b). Data from allosemy and dialectal variation further reinforce the cyclic dependency of passives over actives.
