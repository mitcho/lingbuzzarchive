I provide a substantial and systematic description of linguistic deviation in the language of English poetry, and I argue that previous linguistic theories that generate deviant forms by the application of an extra set of poetic rules are untenable both for theoretical and empirical reasons. I thus argue that we must break from this traditional approach and instead allow for poetic language to be generated by different means. I propose that poetic language sentences are generated by what I call `PF-uneconomical' derivations; that is, the major classes of poetic language deviation, which I call `displacement' (unlicensed movement) and `erasure' (unlicensed ellipsis), are produced by derivations which invoke extra derivational steps in the PF-branch of the derivation relative to their well-formed counterparts. I show that this theory can model the ways in which the poetic language operations can affect both phrases and non-constituents, explain the non-occurrence of some forms, and account for the distribution of the different kinds of deviation attested in the poetic texts, and I discuss the ways in which the operations of the poetic language syntax may interact with grammar-external formal conditions such as metricality. I argue that the proposed theory follows entirely from Minimalist assumptions about the role of syntax and the interfaces, and that as such the theory presented here provides evidence for the importance of economy in the computations of the language faculty.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001185/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001185<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001185">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001185</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>PhD thesis, University of Strathclyde</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>poetic language, syntax, deviation, economy, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1166 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001185">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001185">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
