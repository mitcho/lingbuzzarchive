Investigating the potential syntactic, semantic and prosodic licensors of WTH in sluicing and swiping in the British English variety, we conclude that syntactic or semantic constraints cannot be the source of the difference. Instead, we propose a novel prosodic account in which the WTH must satisfy the prosodic licensing condition that it cannot bear nuclear accent. We show that this is satisfied in swiping, but not in sluicing contexts. Based on the novel findings of an acceptability rating study of swiping, which reveals that both given and new prepositions are equally acceptable for British English speakers, we argue that the preposition is accentuated in this elliptical construction because it is structurally the deepest element. The licensing condition on WTH in sluicing and swiping is therefore not mediated directly by the conditions on ellipsis, but by the particular prosodic distribution that WTH happens to have in sluicing and swiping. We extend the account to similar constructions in Dutch and Hungarian.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005070/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005070<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>the Journal of Linguistics (to appear)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>swiping, sluicing, ellipsis, nuclear accent, aggressively non-d-linked phrases, prosody, deaccentuation, british english, dutch, hungarian, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>167 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005070">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005070">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
