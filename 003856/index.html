This study examines the effects of phonotactic predictability on the deletion of devoiced vowels. Native Tokyo Japanese speakers (N=22) were recorded in a sound-attenuated booth reading sentences containing lexical stimuli. C1 of the stimuli were /k, ʃ/, after which either high vowel can occur, and /ʧ, ɸ, s, ç/, after which only one of the two is likely to occur. C2 was always a stop. C1 duration and center of gravity (COG), the amplitude weighted mean of frequencies present in a signal, were measured. Duration results show that devoicing lengthens only non-fricatives, while it has either no effect or a shortening effect on fricatives. COG results show that coarticulatory effects of devoiced vowels are evident in /k, ʃ/ but not in /ʧ, ɸ, s, ç/. Devoiced high vowels, therefore, seem to be more likely to delete when the vowel is phonotactically predictable than when it is unpredictable.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003856/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003856<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>recoverability, predictability, devoicing, reduction, japanese, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/003856/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2018]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>322 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003856">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003856">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
