Acquisition is then the process of selecting the correct grammar from that hypothesis space, based on language input. To compare KR theories, we establish quantitative acquisition-based metrics that assess learnability from realistic input data. We conduct a 
learnability analysis for three KR theories proposed for metrical phonology and evaluate them on  English, a language that is notoriously irregular with respect to metrical phonology and therefore non-trivial to learn. We find that all three KRs have similar learnability potential, but the proposed English grammars within each theory are not the grammars able to account for the most English child input data, even if the learner has some knowledge of the interaction between English metrical phonology and morphology. This suggests learnability issues exist for the proposed English grammar in all three theories if a learner is attempting to learn a grammar that accounts for as much input data as possible. We discuss ways a learner may still be able to learn the English grammar from English input by incorporating (i) additional useful linguistic knowledge about English metrical phonology interactions and (ii) biases to selectively learn from the input. We additionally discuss which aspects of the proposed English grammars are hurting learnability, observing that small changes in parameter values or constraint-rankings lead to significantly better learnability results.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002072/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002072<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Language Acquisition</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>knowledge representations, learnability, argument from acquisition, realistic input, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002072/v4.pdf">v4 [October 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002072/v3.pdf">v3 [March 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002072/v2.pdf">v2 [July 2014]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002072/v1.pdf">v1 [April 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>3347 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002072">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002072">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
