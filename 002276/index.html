(LD) wh-questions in English, which does not seem to arise out of
L1 Mongolian or L2 Russian. The linguistic behavior anticipated in
Universal Grammar was to mark the LD wh-questions in English with a
wh-expletive sort of what in matrix clause and with the meaningful
wh-word in embedded clause such as *What do you think who Julianne
likes?, instead of Who do you think Julianne likes? These rare L3 data in
English were gathered from eight L1 Mongolian college students who already
had working knowledge in L2 Russian. A cross-sectional oral-
translation method was employed to elicit the data of L2 Russian and
L3 English, which was further analyzed with the One-Sample
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to tell apart the group difference. According to
the statistical analysis, the participants seemed to employ the L2 Russian
grammar in the production of LD wh-questions in L3 English, but they
selected the different wh-expletive what, not how as in L2 Russian. Since
many other natural languages (Hungarian, German, Romani, among others)
do employ what as the wh-expletive to mark their LD wh-questions,
this study concludes that the participants somehow selected the linguistic
option that is available in natural languages, but not available in their
L1 Mongolian and L2 Russian.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002276/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002276<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Language Research, Seoul, Korea</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>l2 acquisition, l3 acquisition, long-distance wh-question, wh-scope marking, wh-expletive, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002276/v1.pdf">v1 [January 2014]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1464 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002276">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002276">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
