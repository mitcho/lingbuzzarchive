I first establish the basic framework, taken form the theory of computation and mereology. This enables me to axiomatize a proposal made by Isaac Newton. He postulates an entity that exists in all concrete objects and processes information and makes decisions. The model rests on Noam Chomsky's current theory about how an organism is able to use language. This capacity requires a physically realized recursive procedure in the mind-brain of an organism that obeys the principle of least action. Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini and Giuseppe Vitiello have demonstrated that this process is isomorphic to the quantum field theory of many-body physics. Following a proposal from neuroscience made by Randy Gallistel for a neuron as a computational machine, I define a model for a computational unit that processes information. Finally, I turn to a proposal made by Roger Penrose. I show that the model lends itself to an interpretation where an organism takes in information, processes this information and can make the decision to send out information. I end by stating some observable predictions.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005195/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005195<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, semantics, computation, principle of least action, decision making, information processing, biolinguistics, neuroscience, physics, theoretical philosophy, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>330 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005195">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005195">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
