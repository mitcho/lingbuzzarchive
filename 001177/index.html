Indonesian verbs of desire, mau/ingin want, behave like ordinary subject control constructions but when they embed a passive complement, they exhibit a crossed-reading which involves an unusual alignment between the predicates and their arguments. Specifically, the matrix surface subject is thematically related to the embedded predicate whereas the subordinate oblique phrase is construed as the agent of the matrix control predicate. I propose that this reading arises because the passive morpheme di-, clitic-doubled with a third person oblique agentive phrase, undergoes syntactic incorporation into the matrix control predicate. The present analysis allows for a straightforward explanation of a wide variety of other facts, including 1) the presence of the crossed-reading in a different type of passive commonly known as zero passives, 2) the absence of the crossed reading in an active complement headed by the active voice marker meN-, and 3) the unavailability of the crossed-reading in the corresponding control constructions in languages such as English.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001177/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001177<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>crossed-control, agent, passive morphology, incorporation, active voice, morphology, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>272 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001177">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001177">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
