Biberauer et al. 2008), given that it is SVO and displays a head-final CP, where C is instantiated by the so-called sentence-final particles (SFP). Since for all of its attested history Chinese has been SVO, the disharmony between VO word order and SFP observed in modern Mandarin is not an isolated case, but rather reflects a situation existing since the emergence of SFP in the 6th c. B.C. Accordingly, the violation of the FOFC represented by Chinese must be taken at face value and a closer look at the FOFC itself is called for. Applying Whitmans (2008) analysis of the Greenbergian universals, the incompatibility between VO order and head-final CP predicted by the FOFC turns out to illustrate (the borderline case of) a cross-categorial generalization. Whitman (2008) argues that cross-categorial generalizations are not exceptionless (as they should be if they were due to an imperative of Universal Grammar), but rather of a statistical nature, because they arise through well-documented patterns of language change.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001021/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001021<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article, unless you want to cite the full url: <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001021">http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001021</a>)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>written version (substantially revised) of talk presented at the Workshop on Particles, University of Cambridge, 30-31 October 2008.</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>mandarin chinese, sentence-final particles, complementiser, root vs. non -root c, harmony vs. disharmony, harmonic vs disharmonic, word order universals, final-over-final constraint (fofc), split cp, sentence force, topic phrase, topic markers, crosscategorial generalizations, syntax, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>422 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001021">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001021">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
