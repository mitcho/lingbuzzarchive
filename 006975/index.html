Only after I wrote this reply (under encouragement from LINGUIST List editors), did I find out LINGUIST List has a rather small hard-wired character count for Discussions. Corresponding with its editors, there seem to be no alternatives on that platform. 
 
This is not a dispute with Rogers, whose review was overwhelmingly generous, just a chance to clarify a few points about the review and discuss a few implications. The delay between his review and this reply—uploaded to LingBuzz on 3 December 2022—is from communication lags with the LINGUIST folks.
 
[UPDATE: It turns out LINGUIST did publish this response after all (linguistlist.org/issues/33.3261/), on 8 December, without further contact. That's not a problem. I know they are stretched thin and working hard there, on a volunteer basis. But I edited this lingbuzz version slightly before uploading, which means there are two mildly different variants in circulation.
