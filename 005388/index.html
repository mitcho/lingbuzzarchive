Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993) allows allomorphy to be conditioned in many components of the grammar: syntax, phonology, and the lexicon. In no small part, the specific pronunciation of morphemes depends on rules of Vocabulary Insertion--the subject of this review. We start with a general review of what allomorphy is, and how it has been classified analytically both in DM and in other theories of morphology and phonology. After sketching some analyses of simple cases of allomorphy, we build towards more complex examples, considering various issues they raise. One is whether, from a structural point of view, allomorphy is conditioned differently by inner vs. outer context. Another is how far away the conditioning environment can be from the affected morpheme. We also review various theory-internal debates within DM, including the role of linear adjacency, how competition for insertion is resolved, and whether this competition is a property of roots. We end with a discussion of broader questions about allomorphy as a phonological and a morphosyntactic phenomenon.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005388/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005388<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted to the Handbook of Distributed Morphology, CUP</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>allomorphy, vocabulary insertion, distributed morphology, lexicon, locality, morphology, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>525 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005388">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005388">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
