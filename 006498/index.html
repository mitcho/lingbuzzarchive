This class of morphology, identified with the names subjunctive, fake tense, fake past, modal past and referred to here as X-marking after von Fintel & Iatridou (2020), has been most studied in the context of English conditionals. However, it is well-known that the morphology is observed in many non-English languages and can appear in various other types of constructions, including counterfactual desire expressions featuring the attitude predicate 'wish' in English. I motivate two desiderata for theories of X-marking in pursuit of an analysis that unifies the phenomenon across expression types and languages. I show how previous proposals for X-marking cannot satisfy these desiderata, making them insufficient for a unified account. I then develop a novel, formally explicit analysis of X-marking which I show to satisfy these desiderata. The proposed analysis makes use of presupposition projection together with pragmatic inference via Maximize Presupposition to provide a unified treatment of X-marking in English conditionals and 'wish' expressions. Lastly, I introduce a hypothesis that all varieties of morphology that can be used as X-marking cross-linguistically--including past, imperfective, plural and habitual--along with their ordinary uses, are vacuous.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006498/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006498<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>modality, conditionals, attitudes, counterfactuality, subjunctive, fake past, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/006498/v2.pdf">v2 [March 2022]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/006498/v1.pdf">v1 [March 2022]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>494 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006498">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006498">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
