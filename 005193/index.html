Richards (2010) proposes that Japanese allows wh-elements to stay in situ because of an aspect of its prosodic system. Specifically, in contrast to some other languages (like English), Japanese can prosodically group wh-elements together with their licensers. This prosodic grouping is signaled by eradication or reduction of the lexical pitch accents of intervening words. In this theory, a question still remains as to whether each syntactic derivation is checked against its prosodic realization, or whether what allows Japanese wh-elements to stay in situ is more abstract in character. To address this question, we test whether and how the evidence of the prosodic grouping is observed in naturalistic utterances. Our analysis makes use of a computational toolkit that allows us to assess the presence of tonal targets on a token-by-token basis. Our analysis shows that almost all speakers produce some sentences that show prosodic grouping of wh-elements and their licensers, as well as some that do not. Our results generally support the prediction of Richard’s (2010) theory, and they furthermore suggest that the prosodic properties of Japanese that allow their wh-elements to stay in situ must be an abstract grammatical feature of Japanese. We conclude that, while language-specific syntax operates in the presence of language-specific prosody, syntax does not vary to accommodate variation in prosody, as least not in this case.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005193/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005193<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Accepted pending minor revisions (Natural Language and Linguistic Theory)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>phonetics, prosody, prosodic grouping, wh-movement, japanese, contiguity theory, token-by-token analysis, syntax, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>451 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005193">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005193">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
