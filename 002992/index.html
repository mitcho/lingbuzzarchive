The preferred method is comparison of very large numbers of languages, sampled so as to control for genealogical and areal biases. The preferred mode of explanation is in terms of functional rather than formal notions. This chapter discusses the history of the research programme, from Greenbergian universals to the present day greater focus on probabilistic correlations between linguistic  properties, with particular attention given to areal features.  Some problems and shortcomings of this generally very successful  research programme are discussed, including problems of methodology and use of data, with special focus on its flagship WALS.  The relation between typology  and generative linguistics  and their relation to universal grammar is discussed.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002992/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002992<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Oxford Handbook of Universal Grammar,  ed. by Ian Roberts, to appear 2016</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>:  universals, large scale comparison, areal features, wals, null subjects, linguistic categories, functional, formal, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1135 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002992">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002992">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
