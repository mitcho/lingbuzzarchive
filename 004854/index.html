The wh-correlative construction shares many semantic similarities with Hindi correlatives and English free relatives, but it crucially features a pair of a pair of wh-phrases that must be matched in both form and number: the strict identity requirement on the two wh-phrases is such that neither of the wh-phrases can be replaced by a pronoun or a definite description, nor can the NPs inside complex wh-phrases differ even minimally. Motivated by this identity requirement, the present work proposes a movement-based account for Mandarin wh-correlatives using key ingredients including wh-movement, clausal A’-movement, and morphological reanalysis Fusion. I argue that the pair of identical wh-phrases in wh-correlatives are derivationally related to each other, and the construction is base-generated like an English free relative but with the wh-word appearing in situ inside the relative clause. The proposal has repercussions not just for the typology of correlatives, but also for our understanding of wh-movement in in-situ languages, and the asymmetry between wh-nominals and wh-adverbials in Mandarin.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004854/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004854<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted (comments are welcome!)</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>correlatives, relative clauses, relativization, wh-movement, wh in-situ, mandarin chinese, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>249 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004854">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004854">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
