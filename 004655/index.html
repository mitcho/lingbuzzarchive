On an informal level, Dist combines with a predicate and a plural DP and asserts that each atomic element in the extension of the DP satisfies the predicate. Against this backdrop, Dotlacil (2011) observes the following puzzle: Dist is apparently unable to combine with plural subjects of predicate nominals (PNs):

I develop an account based on the observation that under the traditional view of plural number, applying Dist to the predicate derived by moving a plural DP results in a presupposition failure if the lower copy is plural. In order for movement to feed distributivity, it is therefore necessary for the lower copy not to contain a plural number feature. I argue that this can be accomplished via Takahashi and Hulseyâ€™s (2009) mechanism of wholesale late merge (WLM), which allows for reduced lower copies lacking a number feature. I then argue that the syntax of PNs independently blocks WLM of the subject, deriving anti-distributivity.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004655/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/004655<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>distributivity, predicate nominals, late merge, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>323 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/004655">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/004655">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
