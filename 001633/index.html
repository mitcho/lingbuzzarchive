defended by Goldberg, Tomasello and others. I point out that proponents of such varieties of Construction
Grammar assume massive amounts of innate constraints on both learning mechanisms
and on cognitive representations, many of which are specific to those capacities. They just take
language to be unlike other cognitive capacities in that it does not involve such constraints. There
is no a priori argument for this position. I also show that no empirical argument can be made on the
basis of claims that semantics attaches to structures rather than words, given that both Construction
Grammar and Generative Grammar allow this. Further, the evidence we have about language conflicts
with the idea that it is unlike other cognitive capacities in having no innate domain-specific
constraints. The facts suggest the need for a theory of structure, and the usage-based varieties of construction grammar provide no such thing.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001633/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/001633<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>submitted to Mind and Language</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>construction grammar, usage-based grammar, generative grammar, semantics, morphology, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2953 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/001633">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/001633">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
