(1) 
a. John saw himself (in the mirror) 
b. * John knows that Maria saw himself (on the reality show)

(2) 
a. John saw his pathetic self (in the mirror) 
b. John knows that Maria saw his pathetic self (on the reality show)

In order to explain the distribution of (1) and (2), I propose that the lexical entry for self denotes a relation R, which I assume is equivalent to something along the lines of PART-OF. I argue that this part-of relation can pick out different aspects of an individual, and that the difference between modified and unmodified self arises due to a requirement at the syntax-semantics interface.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005153/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005153<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Journal of South Asian Linguistics 6, 2014</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>complex reflexives, binding theory, greek, kutchi gujarati, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>165 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005153">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005153">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
