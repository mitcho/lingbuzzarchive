Following Frege, we define two different layers of meaning for each node in a syntactic parse tree: a sense and a referent. The referent of a node is defined as its conventional denotation, which can be computed recursively from the leaves up to the root of the tree. We choose to establish an equivalence between intensions and syntactic nodes by defining the sense of a node as the node itself. Then, we define the English word “that” as a sense abstractor: in other words, it returns as a referent the sense of the clause that it introduces. We also allow a new lambda theoretic type for LF-subtrees so that denotations of words can take intensions as arguments. Thus, this formalism gives us an alternative way of dealing with intensionality. As we show with example derivations of relative clause structures and sentences with “only”, it also handles trace binding and alternative-sensitive words without special-case composition rules like predicate abstraction. Thus, we can understand sense abstraction as a formal framework that unifies our treatment of intensionality, predicate abstraction, and alternative semantics.
