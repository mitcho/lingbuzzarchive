It develops an account of this constraint which is based on the assumption that covert wh- movement is clause bound and subject to superiority. With this analysis as background, the fact that the distribution of multiple sluicing is substantially narrower than that of multiple wh-questions, under both the single pair and the pair-list interpretation, then entails that there must be mechanisms for scoping in-situ wh-phrases that do not rely on covert wh-movement. While long distance cases are handled straightforwardly by existing theories, we de- velop a novel approach to pair-list readings in questions with quanti ers and in questions with superiority con gurations. The analysis is couched in the functional approach to pair-list readings. The paper supports the claim that there is syntactic structure at the ellipsis site, that movement operations within the ellipsis site are subject to locality constraints, and that pair-list readings of multiple questions are rooted in functional readings.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003584/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/003584<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>under review</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>syntax, locality, sluicing, ellipsis, multiple sluicing, syntax-semantics interface, wh-scope, covert movement, wh-in-situ, multiple wh-questions, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>263 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/003584">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/003584">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
