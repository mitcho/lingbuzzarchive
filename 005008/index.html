In this respect, Rappaport Hovav and Levin (2010) argue that verbs are constrained in terms of truth-conditional content insofar as a single verb encodes a manner of action or a result state, but never both. In the present paper, I defend the view put forth in Beavers and Koontz-Garboden (2012) regarding the claim that verbs are actually not constrained in terms of lexical entailments, insofar as the truth-conditional content of verbs can indeed make reference to both a manner and a result. To this end, I focus on what I call murder(i.e. murder, slay, assassinate, massacre and slaughter) and manner-of-stealing verbs (i.e. rob, mug, seize and snatch) and argue that these verbal classes encode a manner of action that brings about a result state. Regarding the manner of action, I argue that such verbal classes encode an intentional-type action that is performed in order to bring about a specific result state. Thus, I contend that agent entailments, in this case, intentionality, are sufficient to induce manner properties.  Last, by making use of sublexical modification, I show that the manner and result entailments of murder and manner-of-stealing verbs are encoded in a single root and therefore showing that root meanings can be more complex than previously assumed.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005008/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005008<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Manuscript under review -- Comments/Feedback welcome!</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>lexical semantics; verb meaning; roots; manner; result; intentionality; sublexical modification, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005008/v2.pdf">v2 [February 2020]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005008/v1.pdf">v1 [February 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>168 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005008">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005008">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
