Our basic observation is that they polymorphically correspond to compounds such as ‘home-made’ as well as compounds such as ‘cake-baking’. We argue that the theme has a distinguished status in these compounds, suggesting that the base for -Im cannot be a plain event predicate, but has an argument structure. Thus, as we provide a compositional semantics for compounds built by -Im, we also hope to contribute to the debate on whether the base of a deverbal noun may have argument structure or not.
