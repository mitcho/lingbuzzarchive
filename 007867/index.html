thought processes. This model is developed starting from a simple proto-language, which humans are assumed to have inherited at speciation.
This proto-language consists of single symbol exchange using a small set
of symbols; similar to the observed gestural communication systems in
the existing Great Ape families. Computationally, the model is built using a single class with the form of a Markov graph node. Instances of this
node class are used to symbolically represent words. The model is built
iteratively in main() as a single graph. Nodes are added to this graph
using a merge, or conjunctive join, operation between any two existing
nodes, notionally labeled as head and copy. A simple first order graph
is developed which is hypothesized to be common to all Mammals and
to generate shared mammal behaviors. This graph is then extended to
allow for more complex human language and thought processes.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007867/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007867<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Springer, Studies in Computational Intelligence</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>great leap theory of mind faculty of language, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>215 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007867">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007867">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
