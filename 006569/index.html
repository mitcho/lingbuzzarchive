In terms of the external and internal syntax, converbal clauses can be divided into two classes, formed by central converbs (such as conditional clauses formed by V-can1) and peripheral converbs (such as inferential clauses formed by V-dak1) respectively. The central class is more integrated into the main clauses and has an impoverished internal structure, whereas the peripheral class is less integrated into the main clauses and has an articulated internal structure. The distinction shows a remarkable parallelism with the central-peripheral dichotomy of adverbial clauses proposed by Haegeman (2003, 2010), calling for a unified syntax of adverbial clauses formed by converbs and by subordinators.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006569/current.pdf">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/006569<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Submitted</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>converbs; adverbial clauses; external syntax; internal syntax; the central-peripheral dichotomy; cantonese, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>160 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/006569">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/006569">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
